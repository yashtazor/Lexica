Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives,David Eagleman,0307377342,10,"There are three deaths. The first is when the body ceases to function. The second is when the body is consigned to the grave. The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time. Many people leave just as their loved ones arrive, since the loved ones were the only ones doing the remembering. He waits with aching heart for his statues to fall. And that is the curse of this room: since we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be. What we call God is actually a married couple. When they decided to create humans in their own image, they compromised and manufactured approximately equal numbers of both genders. Certain nights when they're feeling liberal, each creates a member of the opposite sex, just to see what it's like. (“What is answer?”) They decided it might be easier to build supercomputing machines devoted to finding the answers. So they invested the labor of tens of generations to engineer these. We are their machines. This seemed a clever strategy to the elders of their community. However, they overlooked a problem: to build a machine smarter than you, it has to be more complex than you - and the ability to understand the machine begins to slip away. Your fantasies have cursed your realities. The end of death is the death of motivation. Too much life, it turns out, is the opiate of the masses. There is a noticeable decline in accomplishment. People take more naps. There's no great rush. Your Creators are talented at just that: creation - but they're not involved with the observation and judgment of our actions, as we had previously supposed them to be. The Creators watch none of the details as our lives unfold. They could not care less. The you of eight years old has less in common than expected with the you of thirty-two and the you of sixty-four. The eighteen-year-old you finds more in common with other eighteen-year-olds than with your seventy-three-year-old you. The seventy-three-year-old you doesn't mind a bit, seeking out meaningful conversations with others of the same generation. Beyond the name, the yous have little else in common. When you die, you are grieved by all the atoms of which you were composed. They hung together for years, whether in sheets of skin or communities of spleen. With your death they do not die. Instead, they part ways, moving off in their separate directions, mourning the loss of a special time they shared together, haunted by the feeling that they were once playing parts in something larger than themselves, something that had its own life, something they can hardly put a finger on. There is bitter competition among the gods. Jealous rivalries abound because the stakes are so low; the gods are not large and powerful and they know it. So they try their best to stand out and to be heard. Some of the humans reach out to make cell phone contact with a single friend out of the innumerable hordes. And gazing out over the steering wheel, each human feels the intensities of joy and grief as though his were the only real examples in the world. Among all the creatures of creation, the gods favor us: we are the only ones who can empathize with their problems. Genes unwrap, proteins blossom, synapses rearrange. All this is well below your awareness - you are merely carrying the brainbox with no acquaintance with what happens inside it. In the afterlife you can enjoy all possibilities at once, living multiple lives in parallel. “This,” you tell the angel, “is too much work.” “Perhaps we could warm you up with a simpler situation,” he considers. “How would you like to be in a closed room, one-on-one with your lover?” And then you are here. You are simultaneously engaged in her conversation and thinking about something else; she both gives herself to you and does not give herself to you; you find her objectionable and you deeply love her; she worships you and wonders what she might have missed with someone else. “Thank you,” you tell the angel. “This I'm used to.” Although we credit God with designing man, it turns out He's not sufficiently skilled to have done so. In point of fact, He unintentionally knocked over the first domino. The Rewarders originally thought to offer it as a gift, but the Punishers quickly decided they could leverage it as a kind of affliction, drying up life's pleasures by revealing their bloodlessly mechanical nature. Being let into the secrets behind the scenes has little effect on our experience. The secret codes of life - whether presented as a gift or a burden - go totally unappreciated. In the afterlife you are judged not against other people, but against yourself. Specifically, you are judged against what you could have been. So the afterworld is much like the present world, but it now includes all the yous that could have been. They made smarter choices, worked harder, invested the extra effort into pushing on closed doors. These doors eventually broke open for them and allowed their lives to splash out in colorful new directions. Such success cannot be explained away by a better genetic hand; instead, they played your cards better. In their parallel lives, they made better decisions, avoided moral lapses, did not give up on love so easily. They worked harder than you did to correct their mistakes and apologized more often. You have little sympathy for these less significant yous and more than a little haughtiness about their indolence. “If you had quit watching TV and gotten off the couch you wouldn't be in this situation,” you tell them, when you bother to interact with them at all. But the better yous are always in your face in the afterlife. In the bookstore you'll see one of them arm in arm with the affectionate woman whom you let slip away. Another you is browsing the shelves, running his fingers over the book he actually finished writing. And look at this one jogging past outside: he's got a much better body than yours, thanks to a consistency at the gym that you never kept up. The more you fall short of your potential, the more of these annoying selves you are forced to deal with. True equality. The Communists are baffled and irritated, because they have finally achieved their perfect society, but only by the help of a God in whom they don't want to believe. The meritocrats are abashed that they're stuck for eternity in an incentiveless system with a bunch of pinkos. The conservatives have no penniless to disparage. The liberals have no downtrodden to promote. (Heaven is only people you met:) The missing crowds make you lonely. You begin to complain about all the people you could be meeting. But no one listens or sympathizes with you, because this is precisely what you chose when you were alive. Perhaps you were tortured by the enormity of the decisions and responsibilities that surrounded you, and now there's only one thing you yearn for: simplicity. That's permissible. So for the next round, you choose to be a horse. You covet the bliss of that simple life. Suddenly, for just a moment, you are aware of the problem you overlooked. The more you become a horse, the more you forget the original wish. You forget what it was like to be a human wondering what it was like to be a horse. You cannot appreciate the destination without knowing the starting point. You cannot revel in the simplicity unless you remember the alternatives. And that's not the worst of your revelation. You realize that the next time you return here, with your thick horse brain, you won't have the capacity to ask to become a human again. You won't understand what a human is. Your choice to slide down the intelligence ladder is irreversible. And just before you lose your final human faculties, you painfully ponder what magnificent extraterrestrial creature, enthralled with the idea of finding a simpler life, chose in the last round to become a human. It is not the brave who can handle the big face, it is the brave who can handle its absence. You were much better at seeing the truth about others than you ever were at seeing yourself. So you navigated your life with the help of others who held up mirrors for you. People praised your good qualities and criticized your bad habits, and these perspectives - often surprising to you - helped you to guide your life. God said, “The respect I once commanded was caving. So I came up here for the same reason doctors wear uniforms of long white coats. They don't do it for their benefit, but for yours.”",Awesomely creative think-piece. 40 very short fictional stories about what happens when you die. The framework is inspiring for anyone: coming up with 40 different answers to any one question. But they’re also just brilliant ideas and powerful little fables. I just read it a 2nd time and love it even more now.
On Writing Well,William Zinsser,0060891548,10,"The essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they’re writing fluently doesn’t mean they’re writing well. Establish a daily schedule and stick to it. Strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Clear our heads of clutter. Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can’t exist without the other. Constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Then ask: have I said it? Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time. Examine every word: a surprising number don’t serve any purpose. A writer will do anything to avoid the act of writing. Write in the first person. If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in. (It can always be taken out.) Please yourself, and you will also entertain the readers. Unexpected but refreshing words. It's the failure of the writer to reach for anything but the nearest cliché: Learned by reading the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. The Thesaurus is to the writer what a rhyming dictionary is to the songwriter - a reminder of all the choices. The Elements of Style, a book every writer should read once a year. Read everything aloud before letting it go out into the world. The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis. All writing is ultimately a question of solving a problem. Unity is the anchor of good writing. Unity of pronoun. Unity of tense. Unity of mood. Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five - just one. The most important sentence in any article is the first one. If it doesn’t induce the reader to proceed to the second sentence, your article is dead. And if the second sentence doesn’t induce him to continue to the third sentence, it’s equally dead. Your lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading. It must cajole him with freshness, or novelty, or paradox, or humor, or surprise, or with an unusual idea, or an interesting fact, or a question. Hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read. Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it. Take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph - it’s the crucial springboard to the next paragraph. Try to give that sentence an extra twist of humor or surprise. Make the reader smile and you’ve got him for at least one more paragraph. Salvation often lies not in the writer’s style but in some odd fact he or she was able to discover. I collect more material than you will use. Doesn’t spend any time setting the stage.. Give as much thought to choosing your last sentence as you did to your first. Are you summarizing because you think they’re too dumb to get the point? A good last sentence - or last paragraph - is a joy in itself. It gives the reader a lift, and it lingers when the article is over. The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right. They didn’t expect the article to end so soon, or so abruptly, or to say what it said. Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work. Don’t set up a business that you can start or launch. Don’t say that the president of the company stepped down. Did he resign? Did he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs. Most adjectives : that the concept is already in the noun. Prune out “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much.” Every little qualifier whittles away some fraction of the reader’s trust. Alert the reader as soon as possible to any change in mood from the previous sentence. “but,” “yet,” “however,” “nevertheless,” “still,” “instead,” Dead sentences: The reader can’t visualize anybody performing some activity; A difficult problem in a sentence can be solved by simply getting rid of it. Midget paragraphs - verbless wonders - written by modern journalists to make their articles quick ’n’ easy. Actually they make the reader’s job harder by chopping up a natural train of thought. Disruptive and condescending. “Yoo-hoo! Look how simple I’m making this for you!” Good nonfiction writers think in paragraph units, not in sentence units. I don’t like to write; But I love to rewrite. Don’t annoy your readers by over-explaining - by telling them something they already know or can figure out. Try not to use words like “surprisingly,” “predictably” and “of course,” which put a value on a fact before the reader encounters the fact. Trust your material. Imitate another writer. Find the best writers and read their work aloud. Writers who write interestingly keep themselves interested. An interesting life and a continuing education. The most untaught and underestimated skill in nonfiction writing is how to organize a long article: how to put the jigsaw puzzle together. Nobody can write a decent article about the disappearance of small towns in Iowa; it would be all generalization and no humanity. The writer would have to write about one small town in Iowa and thereby tell her larger story. And even within that one town she would have to reduce her story still further: to one store, or one family, or one farmer. Plain declarative sentences, not a comma in sight. Each sentence contains one thought - and only one. Much of the trouble that writers get into comes from trying to make one sentence do too much work. Now, what do your readers want to know next? Ask yourself that question after every sentence. “What is the piece really about?” (Not just “What is the piece about?”) Readers should always feel that you know more about your subject than you’ve put in writing. Write as entertainingly as possible. Writers should think of themselves as part entertainer. Make your piece jump by being more diverting than everyone else’s piece. This means giving the reader an enjoyable surprise. To write better than everybody else, you have to want to write better than everybody else. You must take an obsessive pride in the smallest details of your craft.",Great blunt advice about writing better non-fiction. So inspiring.
"Mindwise: How We Understand What Others Think, Believe, Feel, and Want",Nicholas Epley,0307595919,10,"“The only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of Eternal Youth, would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to behold the universe through the eyes of another.” - MARCEL PROUST Your brain’s greatest skill is its ability to think about the minds of others in order to understand them better. More time together did not make the couples any more accurate; it just gave them the illusion that they were more accurate. Compared to the mental abilities of other species on this planet, our sixth sense is what truly makes our brains superpowered. The problem is that the confidence we have in this sense far outstrips our actual ability, and the confidence we have in our judgment rarely gives us a good sense of how accurate we actually are. The main goal of this book is to reduce your illusion of insight into the minds of others, both by trying to improve your understanding and by inducing a greater sense of humility about what you know - and what you do not know - about others. Descartes was so certain about his introspective ability that he staked his own, as well as God’s, existence on it with his famous “I think, therefore I am”. People who imagined seeing an instance of blatant sexism thought they would be outraged. When people actually saw this very same act, however, they felt virtually no rage at all. Do people not know their own minds? You are consciously aware of your brain’s finished products - conscious attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and feelings - but are unaware of the processes your brain went through to construct those final products, and you are therefore unable to recognize its mistakes. In each of us there is another whom we do not know. People tended to select attractively enhanced images of themselves, thinking they were more attractive than they actually were. This is why most of the pictures taken of you seem to look so bad. When you don’t know the actual facts about yourself, your consciousness pieces together a compelling story, much in the same way it does when you’re trying to read the minds of other people to make sense of why they act as they do. Shoppers were first shown four pairs of stockings and asked to pick the best. In fact, the stockings were identical. The researchers found that the ordering mattered: shoppers preferred whichever stocking was on the far right (thereby evaluated last) four times more often than whichever stocking was on the far left (thereby evaluated first). No psychologist asks people to explain the causes of their own thoughts or behavior anymore unless they’re interested in understanding storytelling. If you see someone hunched over, you will assume that they are not feeling very proud. Find yourself hunching over in the same way, even if only because you’re filling out a survey on a table with very short legs, and you may report being less proud of yourself and your accomplishments, too. An illusion that we know our own minds more deeply than we actually do has one disturbing consequence: it can make your mind appear superior to the minds of others. Naïve realism: the intuitive sense that we see the world out there as it actually is, rather than as it appears from our own perspective. If the illusions you hold about your own brain lead you to believe that you see the world as it actually is and you find that others see the world differently, then they must be the ones who are biased, distorted, uninformed, ignorant, unreasonable, or evil. The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them. Europeans since the time of the ancient Greeks viewed those living in relatively primitive cultures as lacking a mind in one of two ways: either lacking self-control and emotions, like an animal, or lacking reason and intellect, like a child. It can be easy to forget that other people have minds with the same general capacities and experiences as your own. Distance keeps your sixth sense disengaged. Your ability to understand the minds of others can be triggered by your physical senses. Sit up straight and you’ll feel more proud of your accomplishments. Furrowing your brow, as if you are thinking harder, can lead you to actually think harder. Botox dulls your social senses right along with your wrinkles. Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is involved in making inferences about the minds of others. MPFC is engaged more when you’re thinking about yourself, your close friends and family, and others who have beliefs similar to your own. It is activated when you care enough about others to care what they are thinking, and not when you are indifferent to others. A universal tendency to assume that others’ minds are less sophisticated and more superficial than one’s own. Ubuntu: “a person is a person through other persons.” Your humanity comes from the way you treat others, the idea goes, not the way you behave in isolation. You can recognize intrinsic motivations more easily in yourself than in others. Treat workers with respect, encourage them to think independently, allow them to make decisions, and make them feel connected to an important effort. I stopped staring blankly and instead looked one of the boys directly in the eyes, smiled, and waved. It was like I flipped a switch in him. I suddenly wasn’t just a foreigner; I was a human being. He flew into a wide-eyed smile and a big wave. Engage the minds of others more routinely instead of treating nearby neighbors as mindless objects. Attributing a mind to a nonhuman agent is the inverse process of failing to attribute a mind to another person. Too fast or too slow and the robot in these experiments was recognized as a mindless machine, but at just the right speed, closer to human speed, the robot seemed more mindful. It started to look like it might be thinking or planning or feeling something. The concept of a mind can explain the behavior of almost anything. Religious beliefs are intuitively compelling because minds are intuitive explanations for the behavior of almost anything. Urban children are more likely to anthropomorphize animals such as cows and pigs and deer than are rural children. Why? Because rural children are likely to have considerably more knowledge about these animals, knowledge acquired through direct experience. A man on one side of a river shouts to a man standing on the other side, “Hey, how do I get to the other side of the river?” The other man responds, “You are on the other side of the river.” People are insanely self-conscious. People act like they’re always being watched. Even their house is a performance. All of the world may indeed be a stage, and it’s easy to feel that we’re at the center of it. The social spotlight does not shine on us nearly as brightly as we think. Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind. Becoming aware of your own perspective liberates you from it. “The media” are consistently accused of being biased but never found to favor those making the accusations. People tend to exaggerate the extent to which others think, believe, and feel as they do. Knowledge is a curse because once you have it, you can’t imagine what it’s like not to possess it. Ever tried to get driving directions from a local? Tappers estimated that listeners would identify the song correctly, on average, 50 percent of the time. In fact, listeners guessed correctly only 2.5 percent of the time. The lens problem affects anyone who has unique knowledge of anything: the boss who understands a proposal inside out and is trying to convey the ideas to new clients, the inventor who knows precisely why her invention is so important speaking to impatient venture capitalists, or the coworker who is “just teasing” a new hire who knows nothing of the teaser’s friendly intentions. The expert’s problem is assuming that what’s so clear in his or her own mind is more obvious to others. Consider how they would be judged by someone looking at their photograph. Knowing how you are seen through the eyes of others requires looking at yourself though the same lens that others do. Ambiguous mediums like email and texting and Twitter are such fertile ground for misunderstanding. Those actually receiving the messages, however, could understand the speaker’s intention only when the speaker was on the phone. They could hear the sarcasm dripping from their voice regardless of whether they were actually using their voice or typing with their fingers. Those receiving the message, of course, could hear the sarcasm only through the speaker’s voice and heard nothing from the speaker’s fingers. Believers might be even more egocentric when reasoning about God’s beliefs than when reasoning about other people’s beliefs. If God is a moral compass, then the compass seems prone to pointing believers in whatever direction they are already facing. Politicians talk about what “the people” want: the speaker’s own beliefs. You can’t judge another person until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. You hear it so often because the advice is so routinely ignored - by the rich who judge the poor as lazy and incompetent, the sober who judge the addicted to be weak and immoral, and the happy who can’t understand why the depressed don’t just “snap out of it.” Learn that someone is a member of a different group than you, and you will drop egocentrism and pick up a stereotype to reason about that person’s mind instead. Liberals favor a more equitable distribution than do conservatives, but by how much? The difference between Democratic and Republican presidential voters was only 3.5 percent. Expecting a 40 percent gap between poor and rich when the actual gap was only 3 percent. How your brain thinks of groups of anything: Instead of remembering exact details, you extract the “gist” of the information. The “gist” of a group is not its individual members but, rather, its average. Women tended to think men would be more sexist than they actually were, exaggerating the differences between men and women. Where our stereotypes go wrong: getting too little information, defining groups by their differences, and being unable to observe the true causes of group differences directly. Each of us views only a small slice of the world’s people, hears only haphazard bits of highly selected evidence from news outlets or other sources, and talks to only a narrow group of generally like-minded friends. Stereotypes about majority groups also look to be more accurate than stereotypes about minority groups, simply because larger groups provide more observational evidence than smaller groups. When you go on a trip, much of your experience involves doing the same thing for long stretches of time - flying, driving, sleeping, standing, waiting, walking - but the story you tell your friends afterward is all about the different things you experienced. You define yourself by the attributes that make you different. A man who claims to be searching for himself is looking for a sense of distinction. Consider the common stereotype that women are more emotional than men: Men and women watching the same emotionally evocative scenes show the same emotional reactions, on average, of the same intensity. Where men and women differ is in the outward expressions of their emotions, with women being more expressive than men. But when people watch these men and women, they infer that women are feeling more emotion than men because they are showing more emotion than men. There are real differences in what men and women want but even larger similarities. Those who write about gender are more attentive to differences than to similarities. The differences among men and women are far larger than the differences between men and women. Consider politics: people on opposing sides of each issue consistently assume that the other side is more extreme than it actually is. Real partisanship increases partly because of imagined partisanship on the other side. Israel and Egypt were disputing ownership of the Sinai Peninsula in 1976. Instead of fighting a zero-sum battle, the two sides came together and figured out each other’s actual interests. Israel wanted security, and Egypt wanted sovereignty. The Israelis didn’t want the Sinai Peninsula; they just didn’t want to be attacked from it. The solution reached at Camp David was to give the land back to Egypt but to create a demilitarized band along the border. Israel got its safety, and Egypt got its land. When groups are defined by their differences, people think they have less in common with people of other races or faiths or genders than they actually do. Ignoring real group differences is every bit as mistaken as exaggerating them. The elderly can behave differently than the young, blacks differently than whites, and women differently than men because of stereotypes about these groups rather than because of any inherent differences. The questioner asked difficult questions and, therefore, looked bright. The contestant answered incorrectly and, therefore, looked dim. This is the correspondence bias, inferring a mind that corresponds with observed actions. Common sense infers that the players are of unequal intellect rather than on an unequal playing field. Those living in collectivist cultures and those generally more concerned with social norms and interpersonal harmony (such as in Southeast Asia) are, broadly speaking, more likely to recognize when people’s actions reflect the dictates of their roles and environments rather than their corresponding states of mind, compared to people in cultures that place an emphasis on individual freedom and choice. Most people trust what others tell them even when they might be lying. The difficulty of disbelieving behavior that we naturally take at face value. Misunderstanding the power of context can lead us to design ineffective solutions to important problems. If our intuitions tell us that people do what they want, then one path to changing their behavior is obvious: you need to make people want the right things. Hurricane Katrina: “We’ve got to figure out some way to convince people that whenever warnings go out, it’s for their own good.” The main problem in Brown’s mind was that people didn’t want to leave, and so the solution is to persuade people more effectively the next time. This solution may create a great warning system that leaves just as many people stranded the next time. Many who stayed wanted desperately to leave but couldn’t. They didn’t need convincing, they needed a bus. You can see the offspring of this error in many well-meaning interventions. The poor making unwise financial choices? Roll out a financial literacy program to make their minds smarter. Much more effective for changing behavior is targeting the broader context rather than individual minds, making it easier for people to do the things they already want to do. To keep people from littering, add additional trash cans, and then to pick up existing trash that otherwise makes it look like everyone else is littering. Paying students and teachers for improved performance was completely ineffective. Assuming that a person’s mind corresponds directly to his or her actions misses the importance of context in shaping behavior. As the number of bystanders increases, the likelihood that any one of them will help you actually decreases. The ideal number might be two: one to help you and the other to call an ambulance. The tools at our intuitive disposal are simplifying heuristics that give imperfect insight into the minds of others. The mistakes they lead to create predictable errors that keep us from perfect understanding. Provide simple shortcuts for understanding the minds of others, but they come at the cost of oversimplifying them. After I mention that I’m working on a book about mind reading, my conversational partner assumes I’m writing about either body language (learning to read facial cues or physical gestures) or perspective taking (learning to imagine yourself in another person’s situation). Which approach does the scientific evidence support? Neither. To predict how the storyteller was feeling at each moment, those who could only see the storyteller were significantly less accurate than those who could only hear the storyteller. Emotions were carried primarily on the speaker’s voice. “Microexpressions,” very brief flashes of emotion lasting less than one-fifth of a second and shown either on the entire face or in just a small part of it: The scientific credibility of claims about microexpressions is currently weak, at best. Most of us are better liars than we think we are. Perspective taking consistently decreased accuracy. Overthinking someone’s emotional expression or inner intentions when there is little else to go on might introduce more error than insight. Perspective taking exaggerated the perceived differences between the groups, thereby increasing distrust and enhancing selfishness. What’s the best way to get someone a gift? The science is clear. You don’t try to adopt another person’s perspective and guess better. Instead, you adopt a different approach. You have to actually get the other person’s perspective, and perhaps the only way to do that is to ask what they want, or listen carefully while they drop hints, and then give it to them. That turns out to be widely applicable wisdom. Nearly everything you know is secondhand: things you know only because someone told you. The best predictor of empathic accuracy appears to be verbal intelligence. Knowing others’ minds requires asking and listening, not just reading and guessing. Getting your partner’s perspective by asking them directly works much better than taking your partner’s perspective by using your imagination. Getting people to tell you their minds is the best overall solution for understanding them. The main barrier to getting perspective is that others won’t tell you what you’d like to know. They lie, mislead, misdirect, avoid, or simply refuse to divulge the truth. The vast majority of these lies are told by a small number of chronic liars. Keep your cynicism in check. Many people will tell you the truth if you ask a direct question in a context where they feel at liberty to give an honest answer and you are open to hearing. The main reason people lie is to avoid being punished. Instead of pressuring suspects until they crack from intimidation, fear, and pain, the new and more effective interrogation approach is one that establishes rapport and reduces fears of punishment. People were more willing to admit to having done something immoral when confronted a few minutes after the event - when their fear had subsided a bit - than when questioned immediately after the incident. It makes no more sense for a pollster to ask you why you’re voting for someone than it does for a doctor to ask you why you’re feeling sick. And so pollsters instead ask about what people think. People know their feelings right now more accurately than they can project what they’ll be feeling months from now. Generally focus questions on the present rather than the future. Getting perspective fails if your direct questions turn speculative. If you have to reiterate someone else’s point to their satisfaction, then you’ll find out if you’ve understood. Understanding other people requires getting their perspective and then verifying that you’ve understood it correctly. Technique for creating fast friends is to have two strangers disclose private thoughts or memories to each other. The secret to understanding each other better seems to come not through an increased ability to read body language or improved perspective taking but, rather, through the hard relational work of putting people in a position where they can tell you their minds openly and honestly.","Many new brilliant insights, especially about over-estimating the differences between you and others, thereby separating into us-vs-them tribalism. Scan to the end of my notes, to see. If you know more books like this, please recommend them to me. I adore this subject."
The War of Art,Steven Pressfield,0446691437,10,"It’s not the writing part that’s hard. What’s hard is sitting down to write. Have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn’t write, a painter who doesn’t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what “Resistance” is. How many of us have become drunks and drug addicts, developed tumors and neuroses, succumbed to painkillers, gossip, and compulsive cell-phone use, simply because we don’t do that thing that our hearts, our inner genius, is calling us to? Resistance defeats us. If tomorrow morning, every dazed and benighted soul woke up with the power to take the first step toward pursuing his or her dreams, every shrink in the directory would be out of business. Prisons would stand empty. The alcohol and tobacco industries would collapse, along with the junk food, cosmetic surgery, and infotainment businesses, not to mention pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and the medical profession from top to bottom. Domestic abuse would become extinct, as would addiction, obesity, migraine headaches, and road rage. Dad gets drunk, Mom gets sick, Janie shows up for church with an Oakland Raiders tattoo. It’s more fun than a movie. And it works: Nobody gets a damn thing done. A victim act is a form of passive aggression. It seeks to achieve gratification not by honest work or a contribution made out of one’s experience or insight or love, but by the manipulation of others through silent (and not-so-silent) threat. The victim compels others to come to his rescue or to behave as he wishes by holding them hostage to the prospect of his own further illness/meltdown/mental dissolution, or simply by threatening to make their lives so miserable that they do what he wants. Hitler wanted to be an artist. At eighteen he took his inheritance, seven hundred kronen, and moved to Vienna to live and study. He applied to the Academy of Fine Arts and later to the School of Architecture. Ever see one of his paintings? Neither have I. Resistance beat him. Call it overstatement but I’ll say it anyway: it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas. Resistance comes when you do: Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. Any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Resistance seems to come from outside ourselves. We locate it in spouses, jobs, bosses, kids. Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it. We don’t tell ourselves, “I’m never going to write my symphony.” Instead we say, “I am going to write my symphony; I’m just going to start tomorrow.” At a big New York ad agency, our boss used to tell us: Invent a disease. Come up with the disease, he said, and we can sell the cure. Attention Deficit Disorder, Seasonal Affect Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder. These aren’t diseases, they’re marketing ploys. Doctors didn’t discover them, copywriters did. Marketing departments did. Drug companies did. Jerry Seinfeld observed of his twenty years of dating: “That’s a lot of acting fascinated.” Resistance also told me I shouldn’t seek to instruct, or put myself forward as a purveyor of wisdom; that this was vain, egotistical, possibly even corrupt, What does Resistance feel like? First, unhappiness. We feel like hell. A low-grade misery pervades everything. We’re bored, we’re restless. We live in a consumer culture that’s acutely aware of this unhappiness and has massed all its profit-seeking artillery to exploit it. By selling us a product, a drug, a distraction. The artist and the fundamentalist arise from societies at differing stages of development. The artist is the advanced model. His culture possesses affluence, stability, enough excess of resource to permit the luxury of self-examination. The artist is grounded in freedom. He is not afraid of it. He is lucky. He was born in the right place. He has a core of selfconfidence, of hope for the future. He believes in progress and evolution. His faith is that humankind is advancing, however haltingly and imperfectly, toward a better world. The fundamentalist entertains no such notion. In his view, humanity has fallen from a higher state. The truth is not out there awaiting revelation; it has already been revealed. The word of God has been spoken and recorded by His prophet, be he Jesus, Muhammad, or Karl Marx. Fundamentalism is the philosophy of the powerless, the conquered, the displaced and the dispossessed. The fundamentalist cannot stand freedom. He cannot find his way into the future, so he retreats to the past. He returns in imagination to the glory days. His creativity is inverted. He creates destruction. Fundamentalism and art are mutually exclusive. There is no such thing as fundamentalist art. The truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. Those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them. Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement. Inside the Actors Studio: The host, James Lipton, invariably asks his guests, “What factors make you decide to take a particular role?” The actor always answers: “Because I’m afraid of it.” The professional tackles the project that will make him stretch. He takes on the assignment that will bear him into uncharted waters, compel him to explore unconscious parts of himself. Is he scared? Hell, yes. He’s petrified. (Conversely, the professional turns down roles that he’s done before. He’s not afraid of them anymore. Why waste his time?) So if you’re paralyzed with fear, it’s a good sign. It shows you what you have to do. If you’re feeling massive Resistance, the good news is, it means there’s tremendous love there too. If you didn’t love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn’t feel anything. (Santa Barbara and Ojai, California): populated by upper-middle-class people with more time and money than they know what to do with, in which a culture of healing also obtains. The concept in all these environments seems to be that one needs to complete his healing before he is ready to do his work. This way of thinking is a form of Resistance. What are we trying to heal, anyway? The athlete knows the day will never come when he wakes up pain-free. He has to play hurt. What better way of avoiding work than going to a workshop? What I hate even worse is the word ""support"". Any support we get from persons of flesh and blood is like Monopoly money; it’s not legal tender in that sphere where we have to do our work. ""Who can get through the day without two or three juicy rationalizations. They’re more important than sex. Have you ever gone a week without a rationalization?"" Rationalization: a series of plausible, rational justifications for why we shouldn’t do our work. A lot of them are true. But all this means diddly. Tolstoy had thirteen kids and wrote War and Peace. Lance Armstrong had cancer and won the Tour de France. The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work. In order for a book (or any project or enterprise) to hold our attention for the length of time it takes to unfold itself, it has to plug into some internal perplexity or passion that is of paramount importance to us. The more psychic energy we expend dredging and re-dredging the tired, boring injustices of our personal lives, the less juice we have to do our work. Amateur comes from the Latin root meaning “to love.” The conventional interpretation is that the amateur pursues his calling out of love, while the pro does it for money. Not the way I see it. In my view, the amateur does not love the game enough. If he did, he would not pursue it as a sideline, distinct from his “real” vocation. The professional loves it so much he dedicates his life to it. He commits full-time. That’s what I mean when I say turning pro. Resistance hates it when we turn pro. Inspiration strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp. Resistance; I will not let it faze me; I will sit down and do my work. The Marine Corps teaches you how to be miserable. This is invaluable for an artist. The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell: a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation. The qualities that define us as professionals? 1) We show up every day. 2) We show up no matter what. 3) We stay on the job all day. Our minds may wander, but our bodies remain at the wheel. 6) We accept remuneration for our labor. We’re not here for fun. We work for money. 7) We do not overidentify with our jobs. 8) We master the technique of our jobs. The amateur, on the other hand, overidentifies with his avocation, his artistic aspiration. He defines himself by it. He is a musician, a painter, a playwright. Resistance loves this. Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is overly invested in its success and overterrified of its failure. The amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him. Now consider the amateur: the aspiring painter, the wannabe playwright. How does he pursue his calling? One, he doesn’t show up every day. Two, he doesn’t show up no matter what. Three, he doesn’t stay on the job all day. He is not committed over the long haul; the stakes for him are illusory and fake. He does not get money. And he overidentifies with his art. He does not have a sense of humor about failure. The professional, though he accepts money, does his work out of love. He has to love it. Otherwise he wouldn’t devote his life to it of his own free will. The professional has learned, however, that too much love can be a bad thing. Too much love can make him choke. The seeming detachment of the professional, the cold-blooded character to his demeanor, is a compensating device to keep him from loving the game so much that he freezes in action. Playing for money, or adopting the attitude of one who plays for money, lowers the fever. The pro concentrates on technique. The professional masters how, and leaves what and why to the gods. Professional respects his craft. He does not consider himself superior to it. He wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come. It wants us to stake our self-worth, our identity, our reason-for-being, on the response of others to our work. Resistance knows we can’t take this. No one can. The professional blows critics off. He doesn’t even hear them. Critics, he reminds himself, are the unwitting mouthpieces of Resistance Critics: They can articulate in their reviews the same toxic venom that Resistance itself concocts inside our heads. That is their real evil. Not that we believe them, but that we believe the Resistance in our own minds, for which critics serve as unconscious spokespersons. The professional recognizes his limitations: He gets an agent, gets a lawyer, gets an accountant. He knows she can only be a professional at one thing. He brings in other pros and treats them with respect. Making yourself a corporation (or just thinking of yourself in that way) reinforces the idea of professionalism because it separates the artist-doing-the-work from the will-and-consciousness-running-the-show. If we think of ourselves as a corporation, it gives us a healthy distance on ourselves. We’re less subjective. We don’t take blows as personally. The most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying. The ancients sensed powerful primordial forces in the world. To make them approachable, they gave them human faces. They called them Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite. American Indians felt the same mystery but rendered it in animistic forms–Bear Teacher, Hawk Messenger, Coyote Trickster. “Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, magic, and power in it. Begin it now.” None of us are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us. Instead we show up possessing already a highly refined and individuated soul. Another way of thinking of it is this: We’re not born with unlimited choices. We can’t be anything we want to be. We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny. We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become. We are who we are from the cradle, and we’re stuck with it. Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it. A hack, he says, is a writer who second-guesses his audience. When the hack sits down to work, he doesn’t ask himself what’s in his own heart. He asks what the market is looking for. The hack condescends to his audience. He thinks he’s superior to them. The truth is, he’s scared to death of them or, more accurately, scared of being authentic in front of them, scared of writing what he really feels or believes, what he himself thinks is interesting. Of any activity you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it? Contempt for failure is our cardinal virtue. If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don’t do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself. You hurt your children. You hurt me. You hurt the planet. Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It’s a gift to the world and every being in it. Don’t cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you’ve got.","Have you experienced a vision of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn’t write, a painter who doesn’t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what “Resistance” is. This book is about that. Read it."
"Thinking, Fast and Slow",Daniel Kahneman,66157471,10,"The title of the book refers to two modes of thinking, which he refers to as: * “System 1” = The instant, unconscious, automatic, emotional, intuitive thinking. * “System 2” = The slower, conscious, rational, reasoning, deliberate thinking. ============ EXPERTISE: Expert intuition: The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition. Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it. Philip Tetlock's book ""Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?"" - gathered more than 80,000 predictions. The experts performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned equal probabilities. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not significantly better than nonspecialists. People who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys. Those with the most knowledge are often less reliable. The reason is that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident. Hedgehogs “know one big thing” and have a theory about the world; they account for particular events within a coherent framework, bristle with impatience toward those who don’t see things their way, and are confident in their forecasts. They are also especially reluctant to admit error. It is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. In a state of flow, maintaining focused attention on these absorbing activities requires no exertion of self-control, thereby freeing resources to be directed to the task at hand. Many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible. Putting the participants in a good mood before the test by having them think happy thoughts more than doubled accuracy. An even more striking result is that unhappy subjects were completely incapable of performing the intuitive task accurately; their guesses were no better than random. Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition. When in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors. Here again, as in the mere exposure effect, the connection makes biological sense. A good mood is a signal that things are generally going well, the environment is safe, and it is all right to let one’s guard down. A bad mood indicates that things are not going very well, there may be a threat, and vigilance is required. Surprise itself is the most sensitive indication of how we understand our world and what we expect from it. The main function of System 1 is to maintain and update a model of your personal world, which represents what is normal in it. When System 2 is otherwise engaged, we will believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, System 2 is in charge of doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is sometimes busy, and often lazy. Understanding a statement must begin with an attempt to believe it: you must first know what the idea would mean if it were true. Only then can you decide whether or not to unbelieve it. The initial attempt to believe is an automatic operation of System 1. Unbelieving is an operation of System 2. The operations of associative memory contribute to a general confirmation bias. When asked, “Is Sam friendly?” different instances of Sam’s behavior will come to mind than would if you had been asked “Is Sam unfriendly?” A deliberate search for confirming evidence, known as positive test strategy, is also how System 2 tests a hypothesis. Contrary to the rules of philosophers of science, who advise testing hypotheses by trying to refute them, people (and scientists, quite often) seek data that are likely to be compatible with the beliefs they currently hold. The confirmatory bias of System 1 favors uncritical acceptance of suggestions and exaggeration of the likelihood of extreme and improbable events. Herbert Simon’s definition of intuition: Expertise in a domain is not a single skill but rather a large collection of miniskills. The confidence that people have in their intuitions is not a reliable guide to their validity. In other words, do not trust anyone - including yourself - to tell you how much you should trust their judgment. When do judgments reflect true expertise? An environment that is sufficiently regular to be predictable an opportunity to learn these regularities through prolonged practice. When both these conditions are satisfied, intuitions are likely to be skilled. Intuition cannot be trusted in the absence of stable regularities in the environment. If the environment is sufficiently regular and if the judge has had a chance to learn its regularities, the associative machinery will recognize situations and generate quick and accurate predictions and decisions. You can trust someone’s intuitions if these conditions are met. When evaluating expert intuition you should always consider whether there was an adequate opportunity to learn the cues, even in a regular environment. “Does he really believe that the environment of start-ups is sufficiently regular to justify an intuition that goes against the base rates?” “Did he really have an opportunity to learn? How quick and how clear was the feedback he received on his judgments?” The proper way to elicit information from a group is not by starting with a public discussion but by confidentially collecting each person’s judgment. ============ JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS The way to block errors that originate in System 1 is simple in principle: recognize the signs that you are in a cognitive minefield, slow down, and ask for reinforcement from System 2. When you see lines with fins pointing in different directions, you will recognize the situation as one in which you should not trust your impressions of length. Unfortunately, this sensible procedure is least likely to be applied when it is needed most. Organizations are better than individuals when it comes to avoiding errors, because they naturally think more slowly and have the power to impose orderly procedures. Organizations can institute and enforce the application of useful checklists, When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly - but it is not an answer to the original question. When faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. An easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?). System 1 effortlessly originates impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. You can also feel a surge of conscious attention whenever you are surprised. System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains. Most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. Continuous vigilance is not necessarily good, and it is certainly impractical. Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes Anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think. Test Questions were chosen because they also invite an intuitive answer that is both compelling and wrong: Students who scored very low on this test - their supervisory function of System 2 is weak - and they are prone to answer questions with the first idea that comes to mind and unwilling to invest the effort needed to check their intuitions. Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification. What makes some people more susceptible than others to biases of judgment? Stanovich published his conclusions in a book titled Rationality and the Reflective Mind. Superficial or “lazy” thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality. Rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. When information is scarce, which is a common occurrence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions. You did not start by asking, “What would I need to know before I formed an opinion about the quality of someone’s leadership?” System 1 got to work on its own from the first adjective. The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy System 2 implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs, which closely reflect the impressions generated by System 1. Based on brief exposure to photographs and without any political context: In about 70% of the races for senator, congressman, and governor, the election winner was the candidate whose face had earned a higher rating of competence. A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped. You have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way. You often have answers to questions that you do not completely understand, relying on evidence that you can neither explain nor defend. If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it. If they had been given indefinite time and told to follow logic and not to answer until they were sure of their answer, I believe that most of our subjects would have avoided the conjunction fallacy. However, their vacation did not depend on a correct answer; they spent very little time on it, and were content to answer as if they had only been “asked for their opinion.” The laziness of System 2 is an important fact of life. Following our intuitions is more natural, and somehow more pleasant, than acting against them. You cannot help dealing with the limited information you have as if it were all there is to know. You build the best possible story from the information available to you, and if it is a good story, you believe it. Paradoxically, it is easier to construct a coherent story when you know little, when there are fewer pieces to fit into the puzzle. Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance. Poor evidence can make a very good story. For some of our most important beliefs we have no evidence at all, except that people we love and trust hold these beliefs. Cognitive illusions can be more stubborn than visual illusions. What you learned about the Müller-Lyer illusion did not change the way you see the lines. Intuition adds value, but only after a disciplined collection of objective information and disciplined scoring of separate traits. Do not simply trust intuitive judgment - your own or that of others - but do not dismiss it, either. ============ STATISTICS People are prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately, to situations that require statistical reasoning. Statistical thinking derives conclusions about individual cases from properties of categories and ensembles. Unfortunately, System 1 does not have the capability for this mode of reasoning; System 2 can learn to think statistically, but few people receive the necessary training. From the same urn, two very patient marble counters take turns. Jack draws 4 marbles on each trial, Jill draws 7. They both record each time they observe a homogeneous sample - all white or all red. If they go on long enough, Jack will observe such extreme outcomes more often than Jill - by a factor of 8 (the expected percentages are 12.5% and 1.56%). Again, no hammer, no causation, but a mathematical fact: samples of 4 marbles yield extreme results more often than samples of 7 marbles do. Now imagine the population of the United States as marbles in a giant urn. Some marbles are marked KC, for kidney cancer. You draw samples of marbles and populate each county in turn. Rural samples are smaller than other samples. Just as in the game of Jack and Jill, extreme outcomes (very high and/or very low cancer rates) are most likely to be found in sparsely populated counties. This is all there is to the story. People should regard their statistical intuitions with proper suspicion and replace impression formation by computation whenever possible. We are prone to exaggerate the consistency and coherence of what we see. The exaggerated faith of researchers in what can be learned from a few observations is closely related to the halo effect, the sense we often get that we know and understand a person about whom we actually know very little. The associative machinery seeks causes. The difficulty we have with statistical regularities is that they call for a different approach. Instead of focusing on how the event at hand came to be, the statistical view relates it to what could have happened instead. Nothing in particular caused it to be what it is - chance selected it from among its alternatives. Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to serious mistakes in evaluating the randomness of truly random events. Bad schools also tend to be smaller than average. The truth is that small schools are not better on average; they are simply more variable. A basic limitation in the ability of our mind to deal with small risks: we either ignore them altogether or give them far too much weight - nothing in between. We tend to overweight small risks and are willing to pay far more than expected value to eliminate them altogether. When an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves. Reducing or mitigating the risk is not adequate; to eliminate the worry the probability must be brought down to zero. People overestimate the probabilities of unlikely events. People overweight unlikely events in their decisions. What is the probability that a baby born in your local hospital will be released within three days? You were asked to estimate the probability of the baby going home, but you almost certainly focused on the events that might cause a baby not to be released within the normal period. Our mind has a useful capability to focus spontaneously on whatever is odd, different, or unusual. The unlikely event became focal. Your estimate of the frequency of problems was too high. The successful execution of a plan is specific and easy to imagine when one tries to forecast the outcome of a project. In contrast, the alternative of failure is diffuse, because there are innumerable ways for things to go wrong. Entrepreneurs and the investors who evaluate their prospects are prone both to overestimate their chances and to overweight their estimates. The decision weight for a 90% chance was 71.2 and the decision weight for a 10% chance was 18.6. The valuation of gambles was much less sensitive to probability when the (fictitious) outcomes were emotional, than when the outcomes were gains or losses of cash. The fear of an impending electric shock was essentially uncorrelated with the probability of receiving the shock. The mere possibility of a shock triggered the full-blown fear response. Urn A contains 10 marbles, of which 1 is red. Urn B contains 100 marbles, of which 8 are red. 30%–40% of students choose the urn with the larger number of winning marbles, rather than the urn that provides a better chance of winning. If your attention is drawn to the winning marbles, you do not assess the number of nonwinning marbles with the same care. Vivid imagery contributes to denominator neglect. Low-probability events are much more heavily weighted when described in terms of relative frequencies (how many) than when stated in more abstract terms of “chances,” “risk,” or “probability” (how likely). As we have seen, System 1 is much better at dealing with individuals than categories. “A disease that kills 1,286 people out of every 10,000” was judged more dangerous than a disease that “kills 24.4 out of 100.” ============ PRIMING / ANCHORING Your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware. The common admonition to “act calm and kind regardless of how you feel” is very good advice: You are likely to be rewarded by actually feeling calm and kind. Money-primed people become more independent than they would be without the associative trigger. They persevered almost twice as long in trying to solve a very difficult problem before they asked the experimenter for help, a crisp demonstration of increased self-reliance. Money-primed people are also more selfish: they were much less willing to spend time helping another student who pretended to be confused about an experimental task. When an experimenter clumsily dropped a bunch of pencils on the floor, the participants with money (unconsciously) on their mind picked up fewer pencils. Money-primed undergraduates also showed a greater preference for being alone. The general theme of these findings is that the idea of money primes individualism: a reluctance to be involved with others, to depend on others, or to accept demands from others. The psychologist who has done this remarkable research, Kathleen Vohs, Living in a culture that surrounds us with reminders of money may shape our behavior and our attitudes in ways that we do not know about and of which we may not be proud. Some cultures provide frequent reminders of respect, others constantly remind their members of God, and some societies prime obedience by large images of the Dear Leader. Reminding people of their mortality increases the appeal of authoritarian ideas, which may become reassuring in the context of the terror of death. Feeling that one’s soul is stained appears to trigger a desire to cleanse one’s body. A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Words that were presented more frequently were rated much more favorably than the words that had been shown only once or twice. Biological fact: an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, with withdrawal and fear. If repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad, such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal. The evaluation of the risk depends on the choice of a measure - with the obvious possibility that the choice may have been guided by a preference for one outcome or another. He goes on to conclude that “defining risk is thus an exercise in power.” ============ AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC The experience of familiarity has a simple but powerful quality of ‘pastness’ that seems to indicate that it is a direct reflection of prior experience. This quality of pastness is an illusion. A name you've seen before will look familiar when you see it because you will see it more clearly. Words that you have seen before become easier to see again - you can identify them better than other words when they are shown very briefly or masked by noise, and you will be quicker (by a few hundredths of a second) to read them than to read other words. In short, you experience greater cognitive ease in perceiving a word you have seen earlier, and it is this sense of ease that gives you the impression of familiarity. Information that is not retrieved (even unconsciously) from memory might as well not exist. System 1 excels at constructing the best possible story that incorporates ideas currently activated, but it does not (cannot) allow for information it does not have. The measure of success for System 1 is the coherence of the story it manages to create. Availability heuristic, like other heuristics of judgment, substitutes one question for another: you wish to estimate the size of a category or the frequency of an event, but you report an impression of the ease with which instances come to mind. Discover how the heuristic leads to biases by following a simple procedure: list factors other than frequency that make it easy to come up with instances. Each factor in your list will be a potential source of bias. People are less confident in a choice when they are asked to produce more arguments to support it. Students who listed more ways to improve the class rated it higher! Death by accidents was judged to be more than 300 times more likely than death by diabetes, but the true ratio is 1:4. The lesson is clear: estimates of causes of death are warped by media coverage. The coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy. The ease with which ideas of various risks come to mind and the emotional reactions to these risks are inextricably linked. Frightening thoughts and images occur to us with particular ease, and thoughts of danger that are fluent and vivid exacerbate fear. Anchoring effect. It occurs when people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity. What happens is one of the most reliable and robust results of experimental psychology: the estimates stay close to the number that people considered. The same house will appear more valuable if its listing price is high than if it is low, even if you are determined to resist the influence of this number. Any number that you are asked to consider as a possible solution to an estimation problem will induce an anchoring effect. On some days, a sign on the shelf said limit of 12 per person. On other days, the sign said no limit per person. Shoppers purchased an average of 7 cans when the limit was in force, twice as many as they bought when the limit was removed. Anchoring is not the sole explanation. Rationing also implies that the goods are flying off the shelves, and shoppers should feel some urgency about stocking up. ============ STEREOTYPES Stereotypes are statements about the group that are (at least tentatively) accepted as facts about every member. Here are two examples: Most of the graduates of this inner-city school go to college. Interest in cycling is widespread in France. You will be reminded of these facts when you think about the likelihood that a particular graduate of the school will attend college, or when you wonder whether to bring up the Tour de France in a conversation with a Frenchman you just met. Stereotyping is a bad word in our culture, but in my usage it is neutral. One of the basic characteristics of System 1 is that it represents categories as norms and prototypical exemplars. In sensitive social contexts, we do not want to draw possibly erroneous conclusions about the individual from the statistics of the group. We consider it morally desirable for base rates to be treated as statistical facts about the group rather than as presumptive facts about individuals. In other words, we reject causal base rates. The social norm against stereotyping, including the opposition to profiling, has been highly beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society. It is useful to remember, however, that neglecting valid stereotypes inevitably results in suboptimal judgments. Resistance to stereotyping is a laudable moral position, but the simplistic idea that the resistance is costless is wrong. The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society, but denying that the costs exist, while satisfying to the soul and politically correct, is not scientifically defensible. ============ REVERT TO THE MEAN When you have doubts about the quality of the evidence: let your judgments of probability stay close to the base rate. How to Discipline Intuition: You should not let yourself believe whatever comes to your mind. To be useful, your beliefs should be constrained by the logic of probability. Base rates matter, even in the presence of evidence about the case at hand. Intuitive impressions of the diagnosticity of evidence are often exaggerated. The combination of WYSIATI and associative coherence tends to make us believe in the stories we spin for ourselves. Anchor your judgment of the probability of an outcome on a plausible base rate. Question the diagnosticity of your evidence. “This start-up looks as if it could not fail, but the base rate of success in the industry is extremely low. How do we know this case is different?” “They keep making the same mistake: predicting rare events from weak evidence. When the evidence is weak, one should stick with the base rates.” An important principle of skill training: rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes. A significant fact of the human condition: the feedback to which life exposes us is perverse. Because we tend to be nice to other people when they please us and nasty when they do not, we are statistically punished for being nice and rewarded for being nasty. The “Sports Illustrated jinx,” the claim that an athlete whose picture appears on the cover of the magazine is doomed to perform poorly the following season. Overconfidence and the pressure of meeting high expectations are often offered as explanations. But there is a simpler account of the jinx: an athlete who gets to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated must have performed exceptionally well in the preceding season, probably with the assistance of a nudge from luck - and luck is fickle. If you treated a group of depressed children for some time with an energy drink, they would show a clinically significant improvement. It is also the case that depressed children who spend some time standing on their head or hug a cat for twenty minutes a day will also show improvement. Most readers of such headlines will automatically infer that the energy drink or the cat hugging caused an improvement, but this conclusion is completely unjustified. Depressed children are an extreme group, they are more depressed than most other children - and extreme groups regress to the mean over time. The correlation between depression scores on successive occasions of testing is less than perfect, so there will be regression to the mean: depressed children will get somewhat better over time even if they hug no cats and drink no Red Bull. In order to conclude that an energy drink - or any other treatment - is effective, you must compare a group of patients who receive this treatment to a “control group” that receives no treatment (or, better, receives a placebo). The control group is expected to improve by regression alone, and the aim of the experiment is to determine whether the treated patients improve more than regression can explain. “She says experience has taught her that criticism is more effective than praise. What she doesn’t understand is that it’s all due to regression to the mean.” “Perhaps his second interview was less impressive than the first because he was afraid of disappointing us, but more likely it was his first that was unusually good.” The basic message of Built to Last and other similar books is that good managerial practices can be identified and that good practices will be rewarded by good results. Both messages are overstated. The comparison of firms that have been more or less successful is to a significant extent a comparison between firms that have been more or less lucky. Knowing the importance of luck, you should be particularly suspicious when highly consistent patterns emerge from the comparison of successful and less successful firms. In the presence of randomness, regular patterns can only be mirages. On average, the gap in corporate profitability and stock returns between the outstanding firms and the less successful firms studied in Built to Last shrank to almost nothing in the period following the study. A study of Fortune’s “Most Admired Companies” finds that over a twenty-year period, the firms with the worst ratings went on to earn much higher stock returns than the most admired firms. The average gap must shrink, because the original gap was due in good part to luck, which contributed both to the success of the top firms and to the lagging performance of the rest. We have already encountered this statistical fact of life: regression to the mean. ============ PREDICTIONS Philip Tetlock's book ""Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?"" - gathered more than 80,000 predictions. The experts performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned equal probabilities. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not significantly better than nonspecialists. People who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys. “Miswanting”: bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting. Eliminating redundancy from your sources of information is always a good idea. The magic of error reduction works well only when the observations are independent and their errors uncorrelated. If the observers share a bias, the aggregation of judgments will not reduce it. Allowing the observers to influence each other effectively reduces the size of the sample, and with it the precision of the group estimate. To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, you should always try to make these sources independent of each other. The prediction of the future is not distinguished from an evaluation of current evidence - prediction matches evaluation. People are asked for a prediction but they substitute an evaluation of the evidence, without noticing that the question they answer is not the one they were asked. This process is guaranteed to generate predictions that are systematically biased; they completely ignore regression to the mean. Start with an estimate of average GPA. Determine the GPA that matches your impression of the evidence. Estimate the correlation between your evidence and GPA. If the correlation is .30, move 30% of the distance from the average to the matching GPA. Suppose that I predict for each golfer in a tournament that his score on day 2 will be the same as his score on day 1. This prediction does not allow for regression to the mean: the golfers who fared well on day 1 will on average do less well on day 2, and those who did poorly will mostly improve. When they are eventually compared to actual outcomes, nonregressive predictions will be found to be biased. They are on average overly optimistic for those who did best on the first day and overly pessimistic for those who had a bad start. Similarly, if you use childhood achievements to predict grades in college without regressing your predictions toward the mean, you will more often than not be disappointed by the academic outcomes of early readers and happily surprised by the grades of those who learned to read relatively late. The corrected intuitive predictions eliminate these biases. A baseline prediction, which you would make if you knew nothing about the case at hand. In the categorical case, it was the base rate. In the numerical case, it is the average outcome in the relevant category. An intuitive prediction, which expresses the number that comes to your mind. Aim for a prediction that is intermediate between the baseline and your intuitive response. In the default case of no useful evidence, you stay with the baseline. Find some reason to doubt that the correlation between your intuitive judgment and the truth is perfect, and you will end up somewhere between the two poles. Intuitive predictions tend to be overconfident and overly extreme. Correcting your intuitions may complicate your life. Unbiased predictions permit the prediction of rare or extreme events only when the information is very good. If you expect your predictions to be of modest validity, you will never guess an outcome that is either rare or far from the mean. If your predictions are unbiased, you will never have the satisfying experience of correctly calling an extreme case. You will never be able to say, “I thought so!” The ultimate test of an explanation is whether it would have made the event predictable in advance. We can know something only if it is both true and knowable. But the crisis was not knowable. What is perverse about the use of know in this context is not that some individuals get credit for prescience that they do not deserve. It is that the language implies that the world is more knowable than it is. It helps perpetuate a pernicious illusion. ============ CAUSAL Our mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations. Students “quietly exempt themselves” (and their friends and acquaintances) from the conclusions of experiments that surprise them. When they presented their students with a surprising statistical fact, the students managed to learn nothing at all. But when the students were surprised by individual cases - two nice people who had not helped - they immediately made the generalization. Subjects’ unwillingness to deduce the particular from the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular. This is a profoundly important conclusion. People who are taught surprising statistical facts about human behavior may be impressed to the point of telling their friends about what they have heard, but this does not mean that their understanding of the world has really changed. The test of learning psychology is whether your understanding of situations you encounter has changed, not whether you have learned a new fact. Surprising individual cases have a powerful impact and are a more effective tool for teaching psychology because the incongruity must be resolved and embedded in a causal story. You are more likely to learn something by finding surprises in your own behavior than by hearing surprising facts about people in general. When our attention is called to an event, associative memory will look for its cause. Any cause that is already stored in memory. Causal explanations will be evoked when regression is detected, but they will be wrong because the truth is that regression to the mean has an explanation but does not have a cause. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete rather than abstract; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen. ============ RANDOMNESS Success = talent + luck great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck. The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the ease with which the past is explained. The idea that large historical events are determined by luck is profoundly shocking, although it is demonstrably true. The line that separates the possibly predictable future from the unpredictable distant future is yet to be drawn. ============ INVESTING Absence of bias is not always what matters most. A venture capitalist will never be told that the probability of success for a start-up in its early stages is “very high.” When a venture capitalist looks for “the next big thing,” the risk of missing the next Google or Facebook is far more important than the risk of making a modest investment in a start-up that ultimately fails. The goal of venture capitalists is to call the extreme cases correctly, even at the cost of overestimating the prospects of many other ventures. Some of us may need the security of distorted estimates to avoid paralysis. If you choose to delude yourself by accepting extreme predictions, however, you will do well to remain aware of your self-indulgence. Perhaps the most valuable contribution of the corrective procedures I propose is that they will require you to think about how much you know. I have heard of too many people who “knew well before it happened that the 2008 financial crisis was inevitable.” When an unpredicted event occurs, we immediately adjust our view of the world to accommodate the surprise. We have an imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge. Once you adopt a new view of the world (or of any part of it), you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed. The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can predict and control the future. These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge the uncertainties of existence. We all have a need for the reassuring message that actions have appropriate consequences, and that success will reward wisdom and courage. Many business books are tailor-made to satisfy this need. “When you sell a stock,” I asked, “who buys it?” He answered with a wave in the vague direction of the window, indicating that he expected the buyer to be someone else very much like him. That was odd: What made one person buy and the other sell? What did the sellers think they knew that the buyers did not? A major industry appears to be built largely on an illusion of skill. The buyers and sellers know that they have the same information; they exchange the stocks primarily because they have different opinions. If all assets in a market are correctly priced, no one can expect either to gain or to lose by trading. Perfect prices leave no scope for cleverness, but they also protect fools from their own folly. For the large majority of individual investors, taking a shower and doing nothing would have been a better policy than implementing the ideas that came to their minds. Individual investors predictably flock to companies that draw their attention because they are in the news. Professional investors are more selective in responding to news. These findings provide some justification for the label of “smart money” that finance professionals apply to themselves. A basic test of skill: persistent achievement. The diagnostic for the existence of any skill is the consistency of individual differences in achievement. The illusion of skill is not only an individual aberration; it is deeply ingrained in the culture of the industry. Facts that challenge such basic assumptions - and thereby threaten people’s livelihood and self-esteem - are simply not absorbed. The mind does not digest them. Skill in evaluating the business prospects of a firm is not sufficient for successful stock trading, where the key question is whether the information about the firm is already incorporated in the price of its stock. Traders apparently lack the skill to answer this crucial question, but they appear to be ignorant of their ignorance. Large numbers of individuals in that world believe themselves to be among the chosen few who can do what they believe others cannot. The financial benefits of self-employment are mediocre: given the same qualifications, people achieve higher average returns by selling their skills to employers than by setting out on their own. The evidence suggests that optimism is widespread, stubborn, and costly. Daniel Bernoulli argued that a gift of 10 ducats has the same utility to someone who already has 100 ducats as a gift of 20 ducats to someone whose current wealth is 200 ducats. The psychological response to a change of wealth is inversely proportional to the initial amount of wealth. A decision maker with diminishing marginal utility for wealth will be risk averse. Much more likely to take her chances, as others do when faced with very bad options. Once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws. If you come upon an observation that does not seem to fit the model, you assume that there must be a perfectly good explanation that you are somehow missing. You give the theory the benefit of the doubt, trusting the community of experts who have accepted it. Disbelieving is hard work, and System 2 is easily tired. People become risk seeking when all their options are bad. Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce. In mixed gambles, where both a gain and a loss are possible, loss aversion causes extremely risk-averse choices. In bad choices, where a sure loss is compared to a larger loss that is merely probable, diminishing sensitivity causes risk seeking. Diminishing marginal utility: the more leisure you have, the less you care for an extra day of it, and each added day is worth less than the one before. Similarly, the more income you have, the less you care for an extra dollar, and the amount you are willing to give up for an extra day of leisure increases. A mistaken assumption: that your utility for a state of affairs depends only on that state and is not affected by your history. When you shop for shoes, the merchant who gives up the shoes in exchange for money certainly feels no loss. Indeed, the shoes that he hands over have always been, from his point of view, a cumbersome proxy for money that he was hoping to collect from some consumer. Furthermore, you probably do not experience paying the merchant as a loss, because you were effectively holding money as a proxy for the shoes you intended to buy. Both the shoes the merchant sells you and the money you spend from your budget for shoes are held “for exchange.” They are intended to be traded for other goods. Other goods, such as wine and Super Bowl tickets, are held “for use,” to be consumed or otherwise enjoyed. Your leisure time and the standard of living that your income supports are also not intended for sale or exchange. Only 18% of the inexperienced traders were willing to exchange their gift for the other. In sharp contrast, experienced traders showed no trace of an endowment effect: 48% of them traded! People who are poor think like traders, but all their choices are between losses. Money that is spent on one good is the loss of another good that could have been purchased instead. For the poor, costs are losses. Asked a friend whether he would accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in which he could lose $100 or win $200. His friend responded, “I won’t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 gain. But I’ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets.” I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is costing you a lot of money. Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that you will ever consider? You will have many opportunities to consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small gambles. Rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. The main purpose of the mantra is to control your emotional response when you do lose. The mantra works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, which would all go bad together. It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant bad news about your economic future, watch it! It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning is very small for each bet. If you have the emotional discipline that this rule requires, you will never consider a small gamble in isolation or be loss averse for a small gamble. Broad framing blunted the emotional reaction to losses and increased the willingness to take risks. The combination of loss aversion and narrow framing is a costly curse. Individual investors can avoid that curse, achieving the emotional benefits of broad framing while also saving time and agony, by reducing the frequency with which they check how well their investments are doing. Closely following daily fluctuations is a losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasure of the equally frequent small gains. The deliberate avoidance of exposure to short-term outcomes improves the quality of both decisions and outcomes. A commitment not to change one’s position for several periods (the equivalent of “locking in” an investment) improves financial performance. Having a risk policy that they routinely apply whenever a relevant problem arises. Familiar examples of risk policies are “always take the highest possible deductible when purchasing insurance” and “never buy extended warranties.” A risk policy is a broad frame. Reduce or eliminate the pain of the occasional loss by the thought that the policy that left you exposed to it will almost certainly be financially advantageous over the long run. The outside view and the risk policy are remedies against two distinct biases that affect many decisions: the exaggerated optimism of the planning fallacy and the exaggerated caution induced by loss aversion. Top managers of the 25 divisions of a large company. He asked them to consider a risky option in which, with equal probabilities, they could lose a large amount of the capital they controlled or earn double that amount. None of the executives was willing to take such a dangerous gamble. Thaler then turned to the CEO of the company, who was also present, and asked for his opinion. Without hesitation, the CEO answered, “I would like all of them to accept their risks.” In the context of that conversation, it was natural for the CEO to adopt a broad frame that encompassed all 25 bets. He could count on statistical aggregation to mitigate the overall risk. Money is a proxy for points on a scale of self-regard and achievement. Finance research has documented a massive preference for selling winners rather than losers - a bias that has been given an opaque label: the disposition effect. The disposition effect is an instance of narrow framing. The investor has set up an account for each share that she bought, and she wants to close every account as a gain. A rational agent would have a comprehensive view of the portfolio. The sunk-cost fallacy keeps people for too long in poor jobs, unhappy marriages, and unpromising research projects. ============ ALGORITHMS Each of these domains entails a significant degree of uncertainty and unpredictability. We describe them as “low-validity environments.” In every case, the accuracy of experts was matched or exceeded by a simple algorithm. Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence. Orley Ashenfelter has offered a compelling demonstration of the power of simple statistics to outdo world-renowned experts. Ashenfelter wanted to predict the future value of fine Bordeaux wines from information available in the year they are made. Ashenfelter converted that conventional knowledge into a statistical formula that predicts the price of a wine - for a particular property and at a particular age - by three features of the weather: the average temperature over the summer growing season, the amount of rain at harvest-time, and the total rainfall during the previous winter. His formula provides accurate price forecasts years and even decades into the future. Indeed, his formula forecasts future prices much more accurately than the current prices of young wines do. Ashenfelter’s formula is extremely accurate - the correlation between his predictions and actual prices is above .90. Why are experts inferior to algorithms? One reason, which Meehl suspected, is that experts try to be clever, think outside the box, and consider complex combinations of features in making their predictions. Complexity may work in the odd case, but more often than not it reduces validity. Simple combinations of features are better. Human decision makers are inferior to a prediction formula even when they are given the score suggested by the formula! They feel that they can overrule the formula because they have additional information. There are few circumstances under which it is a good idea to substitute judgment for a formula. In a famous thought experiment, he described a formula that predicts whether a particular person will go to the movies tonight and noted that it is proper to disregard the formula if information is received that the individual broke a leg today. The name “broken-leg rule” has stuck. The point, of course, is that broken legs are very rare - as well as decisive. To maximize predictive accuracy, final decisions should be left to formulas, especially in low-validity environments. It is possible to develop useful algorithms without any prior statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of significant outcomes. Marital stability is well predicted by a formula: frequency of lovemaking minus frequency of quarrels. An algorithm that is constructed on the back of an envelope is often good enough to compete with an optimally weighted formula, and certainly good enough to outdo expert judgment. If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it - six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. Collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate, add up the six scores. Firmly resolve that you will hire the candidate whose final score is the highest, even if there is another one whom you like better - try to resist your wish to invent broken legs to change the ranking. ============ OUTSIDE VIEW Baseline prediction: the prediction you make about a case if you know nothing except the category to which it belongs. The baseline prediction should be the anchor for further adjustments. People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs. “What is the probability of the defendant winning in cases like this one?” His sharp answer: “Every case is unique.” A proud emphasis on the uniqueness of cases is also common in medicine, in spite of recent advances in evidence-based medicine that point the other way. A survey of American homeowners who had remodeled their kitchens found that, on average, they had expected the job to cost $18,658; in fact, they ended up paying an average of $38,769. The greatest responsibility for avoiding the planning fallacy lies with the decision makers who approve the plan. If they do not recognize the need for an outside view, they commit a planning fallacy. The prevalent tendency to underweight or ignore distributional information is perhaps the major source of error in forecasting. Planners should therefore make every effort to frame the forecasting problem so as to facilitate utilizing all the distributional information that is available. This may be considered the single most important piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved methods. Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large railway projects, etc.). Obtain the statistics of the reference class (in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which expenditures exceeded budget). Use the statistics to generate a baseline prediction. Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in others of the same type. Executives too easily fall victim to the planning fallacy. In its grip, they make decisions based on delusional optimism rather than on a rational weighting of gains, losses, and probabilities. They overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. They spin scenarios of success while overlooking the potential for mistakes and miscalculations. As a result, they pursue initiatives that are unlikely to come in on budget or on time or to deliver the expected returns - or even to be completed. In this view, people often (but not always) take on risky projects because they are overly optimistic about the odds they face. This is an explanation of why people litigate, why they start wars, and why they open small businesses. If you are genetically endowed with an optimistic bias, you hardly need to be told that you are a lucky person - you already feel fortunate. An optimistic attitude is largely inherited, and it is part of a general disposition for well-being, which may also include a preference for seeing the bright side of everything. If you were allowed one wish for your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they take better care of their health, they feel healthier than others and are in fact likely to live longer. A study of people who exaggerate their expected life span beyond actuarial predictions showed that they work longer hours, are more optimistic about their future Optimistic individuals play a disproportionate role in shaping our lives. Their decisions make a difference; they are the inventors, the entrepreneurs, the political and military leaders - not average people. They got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They are talented and they have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than they acknowledge. The people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than they realize. These persistent (or obstinate) individuals doubled their initial losses before giving up. Significantly, persistence after discouraging advice was relatively common among inventors who had a high score on a personality measure of optimism. The damage caused by overconfident CEOs is compounded when the business press anoints them as celebrities; the evidence indicates that prestigious press awards to the CEO are costly to stockholders. The authors write, “We find that firms with award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform, in terms both of stock and of operating performance. At the same time, CEO compensation increases, CEOs spend more time on activities outside the company such as writing books and sitting on outside boards, and they are more likely to engage in earnings management.” To explain entrepreneurial optimism, cognitive biases play an important role. We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy. We focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others. Both in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore prone to an illusion of control. We focus on what we know and neglect what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs. I have had several occasions to ask founders and participants in innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the outcome of your effort depend on what you do in your firm? This is evidently an easy question; the answer comes quickly and in my small sample it has never been less than 80%. Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these bold people think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands. They are surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its own efforts. However, WY SIATI plays its part, and entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they know best - their plans and actions and the most immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part. Entrepreneurial firms that fail but signal new markets to more qualified competitors “optimistic martyrs” - good for the economy but bad for their investors. A survey in which the chief financial officers of large corporations estimated the returns of the Standard & Poor’s index over the following year. The Duke scholars collected 11,600 such forecasts and examined their accuracy. The conclusion was straightforward: financial officers of large corporations had no clue about the short-term future of the stock market; the correlation between their estimates and the true value was slightly less than zero! When they said the market would go down, it was slightly more likely than not that it would go up. The answer that a truthful CFO would offer is plainly ridiculous. A CFO who informs his colleagues that “there is a good chance that the S&P returns will be between –10% and +30%” can expect to be laughed out of the room. The wide confidence interval is a confession of ignorance, which is not socially acceptable for someone who is paid to be knowledgeable in financial matters. Even if they knew how little they know, the executives would be penalized for admitting it. The emotional, cognitive, and social factors that support exaggerated optimism are a heady brew, which sometimes leads people to take risks that they would avoid if they knew the odds. The contribution of optimism to good implementation is certainly positive. The main benefit of optimism is resilience in the face of setbacks. Someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes, the fate of most small business. When the organization has almost come to an important decision but has not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision. The premise of the session is a short speech: “Imagine that we are a year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief history of that disaster.” Premortem has two main advantages: it overcomes the groupthink that affects many teams once a decision appears to have been made, and it unleashes the imagination of knowledgeable individuals in a much-needed direction. ============ LOSSES We submitted our essay to Econometrica, a journal that publishes significant theoretical articles in economics and in decision theory. The choice of venue turned out to be important; if we had published the identical paper in a psychological journal, it would likely have had little impact on economics. However, our decision was not guided by a wish to influence economics; Econometrica just happened to be where the best papers on decision making had been published in the past, and we were aspiring to be in that company. A single cockroach will completely wreck the appeal of a bowl of cherries, but a cherry will do nothing at all for a bowl of cockroaches. Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. The long-term success of a relationship depends far more on avoiding the negative than on seeking the positive. A friendship that may take years to develop can be ruined by a single action. The aversion to the failure of not reaching the goal is much stronger than the desire to exceed it. People often adopt short-term goals that they strive to achieve but not necessarily to exceed. They are likely to reduce their efforts when they have reached an immediate goal, with results that sometimes violate economic logic. Players would try a little harder when putting for par (to avoid a bogey) than when putting for a birdie. Loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to reach. The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure. Inevitably, you will place a higher value on them than I do. Negotiators often pretend intense attachment to some good. Although they actually view that good as a bargaining chip and intend ultimately to give it away in an exchange. Because negotiators are influenced by a norm of reciprocity, a concession that is presented as painful calls for an equally painful (and perhaps equally inauthentic) concession from the other side. A biologist observed that “when a territory holder is challenged by a rival, the owner almost always wins the contest - usually within a matter of seconds.” Altruistic punishment is accompanied by increased activity in the “pleasure centers” of the brain. It appears that maintaining the social order and the rules of fairness in this fashion is its own reward. Altruistic punishment could well be the glue that holds societies together. People attach values to gains and losses rather than to wealth. The fourfold pattern of preferences is considered one of the core achievements of prospect theory. When you consider a choice between a sure loss and a gamble with a high probability of a larger loss, diminishing sensitivity makes the sure loss more aversive, and the certainty effect reduces the aversiveness of the gamble. This is where people who face very bad options take desperate gambles, accepting a high probability of making things worse in exchange for a small hope of avoiding a large loss. Risk taking of this kind often turns manageable failures into disasters. The thought of accepting the large sure loss is too painful, and the hope of complete relief too enticing, to make the sensible decision that it is time to cut one’s losses. This is where businesses that are losing ground to a superior technology waste their remaining assets in futile attempts to catch up. Because defeat is so difficult to accept, the losing side in wars often fights long past the point at which the victory of the other side is certain. People expect to have stronger emotional reactions (including regret) to an outcome that is produced by action than to the same outcome when it is produced by inaction. Be explicit about the anticipation of regret. People generally anticipate more regret than they will actually experience, because they underestimate the efficacy of the psychological defenses they will deploy - which they label the “psychological immune system.” Their recommendation is that you should not put too much weight on regret; even if you have some, it will hurt less than you now think. When you see cases in isolation, you are likely to be guided by an emotional reaction of System 1. Would you accept a gamble that offers a 10% chance to win $95 and a 90% chance to lose $5? Would you pay $5 to participate in a lottery that offers a 10% chance to win $100 and a 90% chance to win nothing? A bad outcome is much more acceptable if it is framed as the cost of a lottery ticket that did not win than if it is simply described as losing a gamble. We should not be surprised: losses evokes stronger negative feelings than costs. Tendencies to approach or avoid are evoked by the words, and we expect System 1 to be biased in favor of the sure option when it is designated as KEEP and against that same option when it is designated as LOSE. Decision makers tend to prefer the sure thing over the gamble (they are risk averse) when the outcomes are good. They tend to reject the sure thing and accept the gamble (they are risk seeking) when both outcomes are negative. System 1 delivers an immediate response to any question about rich and poor: when in doubt, favor the poor. Your moral feelings are attached to frames, to descriptions of reality rather than to reality itself. ============ EXPERIENCING The experiencing self is the one that answers the question: “Does it hurt now?” The remembering self is the one that answers the question: “How was it, on the whole?” Memories are all we get to keep from our experience of living, and the only perspective that we can adopt as we think about our lives is therefore that of the remembering self. Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive illusion - and it is the substitution that makes us believe a past experience can be ruined. The experiencing self does not have a voice. The remembering self is sometimes wrong, but it is the one that keeps score and governs what we learn from living, and it is the one that makes decisions. What we learn from the past is to maximize the qualities of our future memories, not necessarily of our future experience. My happy childhood: I always cried when my mother came to tear me away from my toys to take me to the park, and cried again when she took me away from the swings and the slide. The resistance to interruption was a sign I had been having a good time, both with my toys and with the swings. At random intervals during the day, the phone presents a brief menu of questions about what the respondent was doing and who was with her when she was interrupted. The participant is also shown rating scales to report the intensity of various feelings: happiness, tension, anger, worry, engagement, physical pain, and others. The percentage of time that an individual spends in an unpleasant state is the U-index. For example, an individual who spent 4 hours of a 16-hour waking day in an unpleasant state would have a U-index of 25%. Our emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to, and we are normally focused on our current activity and immediate environment. To get pleasure from eating, for example, you must notice that you are doing it. Americans were far more prone to combine eating with other activities, and their pleasure from eating was correspondingly diluted. Priming students with the idea of wealth reduces the pleasure their face expresses as they eat a bar of chocolate. Goals make a large difference. Nineteen years after they stated their financial aspirations, many of the people who wanted a high income had achieved it. Each additional point on the money-importance scale was associated with an increment of over $14,000 of job income. The goals that people set for themselves are so important to what they do and how they feel about it that an exclusive focus on experienced well-being is not tenable. We cannot hold a concept of well-being that ignores what people want. Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.","If you liked “Predictably Irrational” or “Stumbling on Happiness” or any of those pop-psychology books, well, this is the Godfather of all of their work.

A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,William Irvine,0195374614,10,"If you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life. When you are on your deathbed, you will look back and realize that you wasted your one chance at living. Instead of spending your life pursuing something genuinely valuable, you squandered it because you allowed yourself to be distracted. Whatever philosophy of life you adopt, you will probably have a better life than if you tried to live without a coherent philosophy of life. Of the things in life you might pursue, which is the thing you believe to be most valuable? Find delight in your own resources, and desire no joys greater than your inner joys. You are unlikely to have a good and meaningful life unless you can overcome your insatiability. Why is self-discipline worth possessing? Because those who possess it have the ability to determine what they do with their life. Those who lack self-discipline will have the path they take through life determined by someone or something else. Philosophical thinking took a giant leap forward in the sixth century BC: Pythagoras (570-500 BC) in Italy Thales (636-546 BC), Anaximander (641-547 BC), and Heracleitus (535-475 BC) in Greece Confucius (551-479 BC) in China Buddha (563-483 BC) in India Philosophers provided their pupils with a philosophy of life: They taught them what things in life were worth pursuing and how best to pursue them. The Cynics thought people should enjoy the good things life has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. They thought we should periodically interrupt our enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss of whatever it is we are enjoying. But if they avoided the ""good things,"" as the Cynics did, they thereby demonstrated that the things in question really were good - were things that, if they did not hide them from themselves, they would crave. The Stoics enjoyed whatever ""good things"" happened to be available, but even as they did so, they prepared themselves to give up the things in question. The Stoics were not stoical! Religions, after telling adherents what they must do to be morally upstanding and get into heaven, leave it to them to determine what things in life are and aren't worth pursuing. These religions see nothing wrong with an adherent working hard so he can afford a huge mansion and an expensive sports car. Adherents of the various religions, despite the differences in their religious beliefs, end up with the same impromptu philosophy of life, namely, a form of enlightened hedonism. Pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover your mistakes. Hunger is the best appetizer, because if you wait until you're hungry or thirsty before you eat or drink, you'll eat simple food with greater pleasure than others do of the costliest of foods. Parents sent their children to schools of philosophy not just so they could learn how to live well but so they could sharpen their skills of persuasion. By teaching their students logic, the Stoics were helping them develop these skills: Students who knew logic could detect the fallacies committed by others and thereby prevail over them in arguments. We differ from other animals in one important respect: We have the ability to reason. We were designed to be reasonable. A Stoic sage is free from vanity. He is indifferent to good or evil report. He never feels grief, since grief is an irrational contraction of the soul. The sage is a target to aim at, even though you fail to hit it. The sage is to Stoicism as Buddha is to Buddhism. Most Buddhists can never hope to become as enlightened as Buddha, but nevertheless, reflecting on Buddha's perfection can help them gain a degree of enlightenment. Tranquility is a psychological state in which we experience few negative emotions, such as anxiety, grief, and fear, but an abundance of positive emotions, especially joy. Seneca explains how best to pursue tranquility. Use your reasoning ability to drive away all that excites or affrights you. If you can do this, there will ensue unbroken tranquility and enduring freedom. A Stoic school should be like a physician's consulting room: patients should leave feeling bad rather than feeling good - the idea being that any treatment likely to cure a patient is also likely to cause him discomfort. You rob present ills of their power if you expect them. Misfortune weighs most heavily on those who expect nothing but good fortune. We're unhappy because we're insatiable. After working hard to get what we want, we lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires. The easiest way to gain happiness is to want the things you already have. Spend time imagining that you have lost the things you value - that your wife has left you, your car was stolen, you lost your job. Doing this will make you value your wife, your car, and your job more than you otherwise would. While kissing your child, silently reflect on the possibility that she will die tomorrow. As we go about our day, periodically pause to reflect on the fact that you will not live forever and therefore this day could be your last. Think about how you would feel if you lost your material possessions, including your house, car, clothing, pets, and bank balance. How you would feel if you lost your abilities, including your ability to speak, hear, walk, breathe, and swallow; and how you would feel if you lost your freedom. You are living the dream you once had for yourself. Married to the person you once dreamed of marrying, have the children and job you once dreamed of having, and own the car you once dreamed of buying. You are living in what to your ancestors would have been a dream world. You take for granted things that your ancestors had to live without. An optimist sees his glass as being half full. For a Stoic, this degree of optimism would only be a starting point. After expressing his appreciation that his glass is half full rather than being completely empty, he will go on to express his delight in even having a glass: It could, after all, have been broken or stolen. And if he is atop his Stoic game, he might go on to comment about what an astonishing thing glass vessels are: They are cheap and fairly durable, impart no taste to what we put in them, and-miracle of miracles!-allow us to see what they contain. There is a difference between contemplating something bad happening and worrying about it. Contemplation is an intellectual exercise. Conduct such exercises without affecting your emotions. One father periodically contemplates the loss of his child and therefore does not take her for granted; to the contrary, he appreciates her very much. Another father assumes that his child will always be there for him and therefore takes her for granted. Do not over-love the things you enjoy. Be the user, but not the slave, of the gifts of fortune. There will be a last time you hear the sound of snow falling, watch the moon rise, smell popcorn, feel the warmth of a child falling asleep in your arms. Every time you do something could be the last time you do it, and this recognition can invest the things you do with a significance and intensity that would otherwise be absent. It is impossible that happiness, and yearning for what is not present, should ever be united. Want only those things that are easy to obtain. Want only those things you can be certain of obtaining. Gain contentment by changing ourselves - by changing our desires. If you refuse to enter contests that you are capable of losing, you will never lose a contest. The key to having a good life is to value things that are genuinely valuable and be indifferent to things that lack value. Any time and energy spent on events you can't control will have no effect on the outcome of events and will therefore be wasted time and energy. Set internal rather than external goals. Internalize your goals. Make a goal not to change the world, but to do your best to bring about certain changes. Even if your efforts prove to be ineffectual, you can rest easy knowing you accomplished your goal: You did what you could do. Be fatalistic with respect to the past and present. Refuse to compare your situation with alternative, preferable situations in which you might have found or might now find yourself. Be attentive to all the advantages that adorn life. Besides contemplating bad things happening, sometimes live as if they had happened. Instead of merely thinking about what it would be like to lose your wealth, periodically practice poverty: Content yourself with cheap fare and rough dress. Examine the things you thought you needed so you can determine which of them you can in fact live without. If you coddle yourself and allow yourself to be corrupted by pleasure, nothing will seem bearable. Not because things are hard but because you are soft. Ensure you never get too comfortable. Periodically experience discomfort that you could have avoided. Underdress for cold weather or go shoeless. Become thirsty or hungry, even though water and food are at hand. Do not inflict these discomforts to punish yourself; rather, do it to increase your enjoyment of life. Harden yourself against misfortunes that might befall you in the future. If all you know is comfort, you might be traumatized when you are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as you someday almost surely will. If you periodically experience minor discomforts, you will grow confident that you can withstand major discomforts as well. So you won't fear experiencing such discomforts at some future time. By experiencing minor discomforts, you train yourself to be courageous. You'll better appreciate whatever comfort you experience. If you periodically embrace discomfort, you're more likely to be comfortable than someone who tries to avoid all discomfort. You'll have a much wider comfort zone than others and will therefore feel comfortable under circumstances that would cause others distress. Sometimes abstain from harmless pleasures. Pass up an opportunity to drink wine - not because you fear becoming an alcoholic but so you can learn self-control. Willpower is like muscle power: the more you exercise your will, the stronger it gets. By practicing self-denial techniques over a long period, you can transform yourself into someone remarkable for your courage and self-control. You will be able to do things that others dread doing, and refrain from doing things that others cannot resist doing. You will be thoroughly in control of yourself. This self-control makes it far more likely that you will attain the goals of your philosophy of life, and this in turn dramatically increases your chances of living a good life. Consciously abstaining from pleasure can itself be pleasant. You will be pleased and will praise yourself. Periodically meditate on the events of daily living, how you responded to these events, and how, in accordance with Stoic principles, you should have responded to them. Shrug off all insults and slights. Also shrug off any praise. To know how many are jealous of you, count your admirers. Stop blaming, censuring, and praising others. Stop boasting about ourselves and how much we know. Blame yourself, not external circumstances, when your desires are thwarted. Perform with resoluteness the duties we humans were created to perform. Nothing else should distract you. When you wake, rather than lying in bed, you must get up to do the proper work of man, the work you were created to perform. If you do the things you were made for, you will enjoy man's true delight. You cannot simply avoid dealing with annoying people, even though doing so would make your life easier. Nor can you capitulate to these annoying people to avoid discord. Instead, you should confront them and work for the common welfare. Show true love to the people with whom destiny has surrounded you. Doing your social duty will give you the best chance at having a good life. This is the reward for doing one's duty: a good life. Form a certain character and pattern for yourself when you are alone. Then, when you associate with other people, remain true to who you are. Be selective about which social functions you attend. You must associate with annoying, misguided, or malicious people in order to work for common interests. But be selective about whom you befriend. Avoid befriending people whose values have been corrupted, so their values won't contaminate yours. Instead seek people who share our values and in particular, people who are doing a better job than we are of living in accordance with good values. While enjoying the companionship of these individuals, work hard to learn what you can from them. Spend time with an ""unclean"" person, and you will become unclean as well. When irritated by someone's shortcomings, pause to reflect on your own shortcomings. Doing this will help you become more empathetic to this individual's faults and therefore become more tolerant of him. Social fatalism: When dealing with others, assume they are fated to behave in a certain way. It is therefore pointless to wish they could be any other way. The biggest risk in dealing with annoying people is that they will make you hate them, a hatred that is injurious to you. Therefore, you need to work to make sure men do not succeed in destroying your charitable feelings toward them. The Stoics were big advocates of marriage. A wise man will marry, and having married, he and his wife will work hard to keep each other happy. In a good marriage, two people will join in a loving union and will try to outdo each other in the care they show for each other. Consider the source of an insult. If you respect the source and value his opinions, then his critical remarks shouldn't upset you. If you don't respect the source of an insult, rather than feeling hurt by his insults, you should feel relieved. Take the insults of your fellow humans to be like the barking of a dog. When a dog barks, you might make a mental note that the dog appears to dislike you, but you would be a fool to become upset by this fact. What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about these things. Refusing to respond to an insult is one of the most effective responses. Protecting disadvantaged individuals from insults will tend to make them hypersensitive to insults. Grieving the death of his brother, Seneca writes, ""Nature requires from us some sorrow, while more than this is the result of vanity."" Retrospective negative visualization: imagine never having had something that you have lost. By engaging in retrospective negative visualization, you can replace your feelings of regret at having lost something with feelings of thanks for once having had it. Reason is our best weapon against grief, because unless reason puts an end to our tears, fortune will not do so. Responding to the grief of friends by also grieving is as foolish as helping someone who has been poisoned by also taking poison. We are bad men living among bad men, and only one thing can calm us: we must agree to go easy on one another. People mistakenly pursue fame. Some want to be known around the world. Some seek regional fame or popularity within their social circle or recognition in their chosen profession. Almost everyone seeks the admiration of friends and neighbors. The price of fame is so high that it far outweighs any benefits. Don't seek social status, since if you make it your goal to please others, you will no longer be free to please yourself. You will have enslaved yourself. Dealing with other people, be indifferent to what they think of us. Be consistent in your indifference. Be as dismissive of approval as you are of disapproval. Cato consciously did things to trigger the disdain of other people simply so he could practice ignoring their disdain. Not needing wealth is more valuable than wealth itself. If you are exposed to a luxurious lifestyle, you might lose your ability to take delight in simple things. Being exposed to luxurious living, people become hard to please. But rather than mourning the loss of their ability to enjoy simple things, they take pride in their newly gained inability to enjoy anything but ""the best."" People who achieve luxurious lifestyles are rarely satisfied: Experiencing luxury only whets their appetite for even more luxury. Dress to protect our bodies, not to impress other people. Likewise, our housing should be functional. Imagine what it would be like to be old. The abilities you once took for granted will have departed. You used to run for miles; now you get winded walking down the hallway. You used to handle the finances of a corporation; now you can't even balance your checkbook. The most delightful time of life is when it is on the downward slope, but has not yet reached the abrupt decline. In your youth, because you assumed that you would live forever, you take your days for granted and as a result wasted many of them. In old age, however, waking up each morning can be a cause for celebration. Having a coherent philosophy of life can make you more accepting of death. With a coherent philosophy of life you'll know what in life is worth attaining, and because you spent time trying to attain the thing in life you believe to be worth attaining, you have probably attained it, to the extent that it was possible for you to do so. Consequently, when it comes time for you to die, you will not feel cheated. Those who have lived without a coherent philosophy of life, though, will desperately want to delay death. Because their improvised philosophy of life has convinced them that what is worth having in life is more of everything, and they cannot get more of everything if they die. Someone who thinks he will live forever is far more likely to waste his days than someone who fully understands that his days are numbered. We would also be better off... if, instead of working hard to become wealthy, we trained ourselves to be satisfied with what we have if, instead of seeking fame, we overcame our craving for the admiration of others if, instead of spending time scheming to harm someone we envy, we spent that time overcoming our feelings of envy if, instead of knocking ourselves out trying to become popular, we worked to maintain and improve our relationships with those we knew to be true friends. Learn how to enjoy things without feeling entitled to them and without clinging to them. Thoreau was interested in developing a philosophy of life. Always the practical question: How best can I live my daily life? When people experience personal catastrophes, it is perfectly natural to experience grief. After this bout of reflexive grief, though, a Stoic will try to dispel whatever grief remains in him by trying to reason it out of existence. He will invoke the kinds of arguments Seneca used in his consolations: ""Is this what the person who died would want me to do? Of course not! She would want me to be happy! The best way to honor her memory is to leave off grieving and get on with life."" Because grief is a negative emotion, the Stoics opposed it. At the same time, they realized that because we are mere mortals, some grief is inevitable in the course of a lifetime, as are some fear, some anxiety, some anger, some hatred, some humiliation, and some envy. The goal of the Stoics was therefore not to eliminate grief but to minimize it. The first step in transforming a society into one in which people live a good life is to teach people how to make their happiness depend as little as possible on their external circumstances. The second step in transforming a society is to change people's external circumstances. If we fail to transform ourselves, then no matter how much we transform the society in which we live, we are unlikely to have a good life. If you had gone to Epictetus and said, ""I want to live a good life. What should I do?"" he would have had an answer for you: ""Live in accordance with nature."" He would then have told you, in great detail, how to do this. If you went to a 20-century analytic philosopher and asked the same question, he probably would have responded not by answering the question you asked but by analyzing the question itself: ""The answer to your question depends on what you mean by ""a good life,"" which in turn depends on what you mean by ""good"" and ""a life."" He might then walk you through all the things you could conceivably mean in asking how to live a good life and explain why each of these meanings is logically muddled. His conclusion: It makes no sense to ask how to live a good life. When this philosopher had finished speaking, you might be impressed with his flair for philosophical analysis, but you might also conclude, with good reason, that he himself lacked a coherent philosophy of life. Philosophies of life have two components: They tell us what things in life are and aren't worth pursuing, and they tell us how to gain the things that are worth having. If you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life. We gained the ability to walk because our ancestors who had this ability were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who didn't, and yet some people use this ability to climb Mount Everest, an activity that distinctly reduces their chances of surviving. Just as we can ""misuse"" our ability to hear or walk-use these abilities, that is, in a way that has nothing to do with the survival and reproduction of our species-we can misuse our ability to reason. In particular, we can use it to circumvent the behavioral tendencies that have been programmed into us by evolution. We can use our reasoning ability to conclude that many of the things that our evolutionary programming encourages us to seek, such as social status and more of anything we already have, may be valuable if our goal is simply to survive and reproduce, but aren't at all valuable if our goal is instead to experience tranquility while we are alive. It's now possible to survive despite having low social status; even if others despise us, the law prevents them from taking our food from us or driving us from our home. Furthermore, low social status is no longer an impediment to reproduction; indeed, in many parts of the world, men and women with low social status have higher rates of reproduction than men and women with high social status. If our goal is not merely to survive and reproduce but to enjoy a tranquil existence, the pain associated with a loss of social status isn't just useless, it is counterproductive. Consider our insatiability: As we have seen, our evolutionary ancestors benefited from wanting more of everything, which is why we today have this tendency. But our insatiability, if we do not take steps to bridle it, will disrupt our tranquility; instead of enjoying what we already have, we will spend our life working hard to gain things we don't have, in the sadly mistaken belief that once we have them, we will enjoy them and search no further. What we must do, again, is misuse our intellect. Instead of using it to devise clever strategies to get more of everything, we must use it to overcome our tendency toward insatiability. Stoicism is a cure for a disease. The disease in question is the anxiety, grief, fear, and various other negative emotions that plague humans and prevent them from experiencing a joyful existence. Engage in negative visualization each night at bedtime. After mastering negative visualization, a novice Stoic should move on to become proficient in applying the trichotomy of control. Do your best to accept the past, whatever it might have been, and to embrace the present, whatever it might be. Refuse to spend time engaging in ""if only"" thoughts about the past and present. Whenever you undertake an activity in which public failure is a possibility, you are likely to experience butterflies in your stomach. Since becoming a stoic, I have become a collector of insults. I have also become a collector of butterflies. A calm life is actually disquieting because we are unaware of whether we would remain strong in the case of a tempest. The biggest mistake, the one made by a huge number of people, is to have no philosophy of life at all. These people feel their way through life by following the promptings of their evolutionary programming, by assiduously seeking out what feels good and avoiding what feels bad. By doing this, they might have a comfortable life or even a life filled with pleasure. The question remains, however, whether they could have a better life by turning their back on their evolutionary programming and instead devoting time and energy to acquiring a philosophy of life.

Mine was self-developed haphazardly, so it was fascinating to read the refined developed original. Really resonated."
The Time Paradox,Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd,1416541993,10,"Just as fish may be unaware of the existence of the water in which they swim, most of us are unaware of the ceaselessly flowing time in which we live. How you spend today ultimately determines both your past and future. A financial planner helps to determine your investment strategy based upon your personal investment goals. If only there were such a person to call upon for investing time! Asking: What do you want out of life? How can you make your time matter? What is the right use of your time? 90% of the students that were late (told to rush across campus) didn't stop to help a homeless person, even though they were being tested on compassion. They were in a future-oriented mindset. Future-oriented people tend to be more successful professionally and academically, to eat well, to exercise regularly, and to schedule preventative doctor's exams. But they are the least likely to help others in need. Present-oriented people tend to be willing to help others, but appear less willing or able to help themselves. They're more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, to gamble, to use drugs and alcohol than future-oriented people are. They are also less likely to exercise, eat well, and engage in preventative health such as flossing and getting regular exams. They are the least likely to be successful. Psychoanalysis stresses the importance of the past. Existential psychotherapy stresses the importance of the present. Humanistic psychotherapy stresses the importance of the future. In a typical day, you make hundreds of decisions: What to wear, what to eat, what to do with your free time, with whom to associate, and whom to avoid. On any given day, these decisions appear trivial, even inconsequential. Taken as a whole, they define who you were, who you are, and who you will become. Death is the end of a lifetime. Denial of death is a denial that time will end. If you deny that time ends, you are likely to treat time much differently than you would if you felt time to be scarce and of limited duration. If you imagine your life as infinite, you are unlikely to value time as more precious than gold and more likely to treat it as ordinary grains of sand on a beach. Ironically, denying death relieves anxiety and psychological stress, but it may also lead you to devalue life, so you may life less fully. When faced with routine decisions, people conserve their thought cycles and rely instead on mental heuristics - simple, practical rules of thumb that we learn through trial and error. We save our judgement and decision-making skills for thinking about the novel, unpredictable, and dangerous forces in our lives: for predicting the future. ""No man who is correctly informed as to the past will be disposed to take a morose or desponding view of the present."" - Thomas Babington Macaulay SIX TIME PERSPECTIVES: • Past-negative • Past-positive • Present-fatalistic • Present-hedonistic • Future • Transcendental-future Take the tests at http://www.thetimeparadox.com to find your type. Another present-oriented time zone can be called the Holistic Present. It involves training to live one's life in the present moment and to include past and future in an expanded state of focus on the present. The Crypt of the Capuchin Monks: ""What you are, they once were. What they are, you will be."" Live meaningfully and fully the lives we are living right now. Robert Levine measured the pace of life in 36 American cities by recording walking speed, bank teller speed, talking speed, and the frequency that watches are worn. Boston, NYC and other Northeast cities are the fastest cities in America. Southern and Western are the slowest. Los Angeles is the slowest of all. Cities with the fastest pace of life were the least helpful (Good Samaritan research). Los Angeles was unique for being slowest and least helpful. *** THE PAST: Your ability to cast your time consciously in a positive light is a good indicator of psychological and emotional health. You can reinterpret and rewrite your personal past, which can give you a greater sense of control over the future. How we think and feel today influences how we remember yesterday. After being shown an ad talking about the wonders of Disneyland, including shaking hands with Bugs Bunny, people were asked about their own memories of visiting Disneyland. 16 percent vividly remembered shaking hands with Bugs Bunny, even though there's no Bugs Bunny at Disneyland. (He's a Warner Brothers character.) It's not the events of the past that most strongly influence our lives. Our attitude toward events in the past matter more than the events themselves. WHO WAS I?

""To be able to enjoy one's past is to live twice."" - Martial (1st century Roman poet) If the people in a culture that uses the past to evaluate current situations share a past trauma, they are likely to want revenge. To the extent that people share positive views of the past, they seek to maintain the status quo culturally and politically. In a global economy, nations that live in the past will be left behind. Those with most involvement with their families are highly past-positive. *** THE PRESENT: Our lives start with a natural focus on the present, but some people continue to focus on present biological stimulation into adulthood, responding only to events happening in their immediate physical and social environment. Some present information is needed to enjoy life. Too much present orientation can rob life of happiness. People in volatile economies do not invest. Political and economic instability also causes instability within families and causes people to trust only what they can hold in their hands. The development of a future orientation requires stability and consistency in the present. Less educated people are more likely to live in the present. Societies that offer less opportunity for education are likely to have more citizens whose focus is limited to the present. When women's educational level advances, their children and social class also advance. Ambition and a need for achievement drive a future orientation that focuses on work, savings, and planning for a continually better life through one's efforts. Present-oriented top athletes or rock stars also worked hard for their money, but many also retained a present perspective that biases them toward addictive behaviors. Robert Levine fascinating book: A Geography of Time Hedonistic people enjoy all things that yield pleasure and avoid things that cause pain. Beyond passive enjoyment, hedonists actively seek pleasure. They arrange their choices in life around activities and relationships that are pleasurable, arousing, stimulating, exciting, and novel. They focus on immediate gratification, self-stimulation, and short-term payoffs. Such people avoid people and situations that are tedious, that require high effort and maintenance, or that are regularized or boring. They are playful and impulsive at all ages, undertaking play and pleasant leisure activities for their intrinsic worth and continuing them as long as they do not become boring. On the negative side, they are likely to have undercontrolled egos, to prefer inconsistency in their lives, to have weak impulse control, and to be less conscientious and emotionally stable than others. On the positive side, they make good friends, lovers, and party guests. They enjoy other people as a source of stimulation, as long as the others are not boring. (Phil Z tripping:) The sensual sensations occurred only when his time sense was expanded. The present perspective has both good and bad effects, though the good generally offset the bad. Hedonists live active high-intensity lives, filled with as much excitement, novelty, and spontaneity as possible. They engage in diverse activities, sports, and hobbies. They learn early to make friends and lovers easily and frequently, and are apt to fill their lives with people whom they find stimulating and with possessions they can show off. If they have enough money, they take great joy in living, appreciating nature, animals, and people around them. People like to be with them because, like children, they have an open-eyed readiness to connect and an intensity that comes from being totally in the moment. The demands of the to-do list never dilute their here-and-now. They generally do not make lists, and when they do, forget to check them. Sensuality is central. They are always open to sensory input, taking time to smell the proverbial roses and to touch. Future-oriented folks can also become totally absorbed in their work: get into the flow. Characteristics of FLOW: • Clear goals • Concentrating and focusing • Loss of self-consciousness • Distorted sense of time • Balance between ability level and challenge (not too easy or too hard) • Personal control over the situation or activity • The activity is intrinsically rewarding, so there's an effortlessness of action Flow is involvement in the process of whatever you are doing. When in flow, you are not focused on the product of the process in which you are engaged. When we are concerned about the product, we worry about how it will be judged, evaluated, accepted, and rejected. Painting: Half the group was told they would be judged, half told to focus on process. Present hedonists painting in the process condition were most creative. Futures painting in the product condition produced paintings with the most technical merit. Immediate large rewards that result in large delayed punishments and overall net loss: has the effect like reverse binoculars, making the future small and remote, not allowing it to affect current decisions and actions. Programs like DARE focus on aversive future consequences that work for future-oriented people but not for present-oriented: the target audience. They focus on personal willpower, which fails to recognize powerful situational and social forces in the present behavioral context that influence Hedonists and Fatalists more than they do others. WHO AM I? Answer 20 times I am _____ I am _____ When am I ____ When am I ____ Where am I ____ Where am I ____ How do I feel ______ How do I feel ______ What happens when many people in any society live in the present? They are all late! They are never on time! **** THE FUTURE: Ratomir Dujkovic brought to the present-oriented Ghana team a Balkan discipline that featured a highly focused future time perspective and insistence on discipline. Instilled discipline, toughness, goal-scoring and puntuality most important. High expectations of future success. When they combined their present-oriented creativity with their newfound future desire to win, they came in eighth-finals for World Cup, only losing to Brazil (2006). (( DEREK'S NOTE: I've emails from at least 10 different people, telling me this info is not correct. Please, no need to do that again. The details of the example don't matter. )) The mantra of a Future is ""meet tomorrow's deadline, complete all the necessary work before tonight's play"". Futures consider work a source of special pleasure. Tomorrow's anticipated gains and losses fuel today's decisions and actions. Unlike their Hedonistic peers who live in their bodies, the Futures live in their minds, envisioning other selves, scenarios, rewards, and successes. The soccer team's belief in its own strength and high level of performance: they believed that they could influence the future by working hard in the present. When you want to achieve something and you believe that you can, you work harder. Environment that creates Future-oriented people: • living in a temperate zone • living in a stable family • being Protestant or Jewish • becoming educated • being a young or middle-aged adult • having a job • using technology regularly • being successful • having future-oriented role models • recovering from childhood illness Preparing for seasonal change involves planning, so people become used to anticipating worse weather in winter and summer. Living in a mildly tropical climate is being in paradise with an extended lease. Early repeated failure breeds a sense of helplessness and makes you shun that area of performance where you failed. Learning that a hero became successful through hard work, effort, practice, and self-denial in order to pursue a dream inspires emulation of that person. MAZE: When challenged to solve puzzles as quickly as they could, the Presents and Futures responded very differently. The Presents started immediately from the start, moving their pencils through the maze. The Futures did not move at all at first, looking for the goal, then working backwards to the starting point, checking out dead ends en route. The Futures always won. People discontinue physical rehabilitation because it hurts more to do the regimen than to quit it. Futures endure the pain for the short term because of the long-term gain it provides. Futures are competitive when negotiating deals or arguing. Tragedy of the commons: the selfish prevail over the farsighted because shorter-term individual yields would be greater than the communal, longer-term gain. The common good is not a moral matter but a time-perspective matter. WHO WILL I BE? Answer 15 times: I will be _____ I will be _____ Concrete future goal: __________ Completed by: _____ Concrete future goal: __________ Completed by: _____ Mentally rehearse reaching goals. Focus on the outcome. Rehearse the individual steps, step-by-step. **** TRANSCENDENTAL FUTURE: Because there is no possibility of contradictory evidence, belief in the transcendental future may be especially resistant to change. ""In every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the 7th generation, even if it requires having skin as thick as the bark of a pine."" - Iroquois Indian saying. We will win the war on terror not by destroying our enemy's future but by nurturing it. The motivational power of the mundane future must be restored if mundane future goals are to compete with transcendental-future goals. Only by building a mundane future full of hope, optimism, respect, health, and prosperity can the motivational power of the transcendental future be balanced. Doing so requires replacing past-negatives and present-fatalistic time perspectives with past-positive and present-hedonistic ones. We have to respect people for their pasts and allow them to enjoy the present. Provide adequate resources and opportunities to those who lack them: food, shelter, money, education, employment, recreation, relaxation, and community celebration. Instill a sense of personal responsibility for seizing a desirable opportunity. Individual initiative must be encouraged and rewarded. Supplementing transcendental-future time perspectives with more practical future time perspectives. (Expecting people to change their transcendental-future beliefs is insulting and exacerbates conflict.) Offer hope, opportunity, and fulfillment in the future on the way to the Promised Land. The development of a future time perspective requires stable political, economic, and family conditions. People must believe that their actions today will lead to predictable and desirable rewards in the future. *** TIME, BODY, HEALTH Circadian rhythm comes from Latin ""circa"" (around) ""dies"" (day) : means ""about a day"". Car accidents increase by 10% the day after clocks are set forward in the spring, and decrease by a smaller amount the day after clocks are set back in the fall. Dangerous events often restrict time perspective to the present. Under acute stress, refugees narrowed their view to a highly focused present. Fear and excitement heighten our present awareness, sharpen our instincts, and help us survive. Emotions deal with the present. Thinking prepares for the future. Depressed people look not to the future but to the past to relieve their depression. They feel that rehashing and rehearsing the causes of their symptoms will somehow help to solve their problems. This quickly deteriorates into a vicious downward spiral that exacerbates the severity and length of depression. An obsessive focus on the past makes people less able to think about the future. Maintaining past-negative attitudes by thinking and talking about them repeatedly is not a good strategy. Put the past to rest and build on it the vision of a better future. Women on Dr. Phil's show: had never consciously chosen to be fat, but then had chosen what they ate from a purely present-oriented perspective, without regard for consequences. *** TIME AND MONEY The ability to delay gratification at age 4 is twice as good a predictor of later SAT scores as IQ. Your chronological time - time passed since birth - is as relevant as your sense of the time remaining until your death. Anything that constrains our sense of an unlimited future shifts our motivations and priorities away from future goals and toward present emotional satisfaction. A limited future encourages us to make choices that enhance our positive emotional state rather than, for instance, to pursue an education or other future-oriented activity. Because older people anticipate a limited future, they are more apt to do what feels good - from speaking their minds to travelling to making dramatic changes in their lives. The same may be said for anyone who is in a situation that portends an uncertain future or clearly defined end, such as having a terminal disease or losing a job. We regulate our emotions to try to maintain a sense of overall well-being. When you imagine that you have a lot of time left, you use it to learn more about the world, meet new people, and experience novelty. When a life's time is short, its goals become more short-term. Those who anticipate a long-term future say ""more is better"" and look to spend time with a lot of different people and new acquaintances. Those who anticipate a short future is ""quality not quantity"", and they choose to spend quality time with fewer people. Men who have not established a convoy of buddies (a reliable group of friends) by early adulthood may never do so, and may go through life with few or no close friends. Seek knowledge about yourself and your world. Look for help doing so from a range of experts and variety of acquaintances. Learning to control impulses and make better choices is inextricably connected with being aware of one's internal states and with managing feelings rather than acting them out. Emotions rather than reason tend to drive the behavior of people who have poor impulse control. Impulsivity is the hallmark of present-hedonistic adolescents, but many carry it over into adulthood. Thrill wins over will. We sometimes delude ourselves that we proceed in a rational manner and weigh all of the pros and cons of various alternatives. But this is seldom the actual case. Quite often “I decided in favor of X” is no more than “I liked X”. We buy the cars we like, choose the jobs and houses we find attractive, then justify these choices by various reason. If we always chose the consequences of our actions when we chose those actions, none of us would be fat, drink, smoke, or fail examinations by not studying. Future-oriented people believe that when you choose a behavior, you choose its future consequences. But sometimes you do not choose a behavior. Sometimes a behavior chooses you based upon the environment in which you find yourself. Queen Elizabeth said she'd ""trade all my possessions for a moment of time"". There were no takers. Pasts are more interested in preserving money. Present Fatalists treat money as though it doesn't matter. Hedonists use their money to create fun and excitement. Futures feel time and money denote possibilities for the future. *** LOVE AND HAPPINESS Couples with mismatched time perspectives will be prone to miscommunication and misunderstanding. How do you bridge the gap in the languages of time? You start with the present. The present is the bridge from the past to the future. The present is the meeting place for good as well as difficult times. When two people are arguing, they can be tempted to leave the bridge of the present and become lost in the fog of the past or imagined future, losing their connection. By always looking through the present to the next goal, you likely do not fully appreciate the present. Read Sonka Lyubomirsky's book ""The How of Happiness"" and Martin Seligman's ""Authentic Happiness"". Buddhist student worked for years to see the master. Ascended to a mountaintop and waited for days. The master finally acknowledged the student by asking, ""At the beginning of the trail that leads to this mountaintop, there is a sign on one side of the trail. On which side is it?"" Mindfulness matters more than abstract knowledge. ""Success is a peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming."" - John Wooden Identify the things in your life that make you happy, and do more of them. Identify the things in your life that make you unhappy, and do less of them. By being mindful, you may be able to detect the influence of your environment with you want to be rid of it. *** BUSINESS, POLITICS AND TIME: (Enron:) Greed dissolved future orientation and replaced it with a present orientation that excluded the prospect of getting caught. Great leaders are able to become completely engrossed in the present and to harness the passion they generate in the service of future goals. They have a unique ability to be fully in the moment and to make an audience feel that they are the exclusive focus of their attention. Then they use the energy they generate by their present focus to create a compelling vision of the future. The unexpected occurs when the future doesn't turn out the way you thought it would. The unexpected can signal unexpected success or unexpected failure. Both have their virtues. When the unexpected chance event happens, it is more likely that future-oriented people will understand what it means and how to capitalize on it, because they have already invested in education and have learned to focus on contingencies and causal thinking. They can quickly go from ""aha"" to ""so that's it!"" because they are prepared to take the new and put it in familiar old molds or create new ones that fit better. Future goals can help us avoid the urgent-new trap. Once we've determined whether we want fame, fortune, happiness, excitement, quiet, comfort, some, or all of the above, then we can decide how to best spend our time achieving them. People are generally risk-averse in the domain of gains. This means that people avoid risk after having secured a sure gain. Students: Ill-defined and unrealistic goals (brain surgeon, rock star, NBA superstar) were replaced with specific well-defined goals that they could reasonably meet. When a person does not have a concept of the future or believes there is no future for him, the future cannot be taken from him. *** RESETTING YOUR CLOCK ""To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time."" - Leonard Bernstein The optimal time perspective profile is: - high in past-positive - moderately high in future - moderately high in present-hedonistic - low in past-negative - low in present-fatalistic Choose the time perspective most appropriate for each situation. Open your eyes to the full range of human experience. Depending on the demands of a situation, one time perspective must take precedence, while others may temporarily recede. When you have work to finish, the future time perspective comes to the forefront. When your work is done, and it's time for pleasure, the present-hedonistic time perspective will surface. During the holidays, the past-positive time perspective is most appropriate for preparing you to enjoy family customs. Self actualizing person: Tie the past and the future to the present in meaningful continuity. Not burdened by guilts, regrets, and resentments. Aspirations are tied meaningfully to present working goals. Faith in the future without rigid or over-idealistic goals. *** OUT OF TIME The Golden Rule of time: Use your time as you would like others to use theirs. *** GREAT SUMMARY FROM AN AMAZON REVIEWER: Past-oriented people: 1- They are generally more concerned with their past and seem to be able to distance themselves from the realities of the present or the future. 2- They usually tend to be traditional, religious, and conservative. 3- They have a stable sense of self. 4- They usually tend to be family- and group-oriented and are distrustful of strangers; thus they may have a tendency to be prejudiced. 5- They usually focus on their obligations and commitments whether personal or collective (i.e. family, cultural, or tribal obligations). 6- Rituals and myths play important roles in their lives. 7- They may have guilt as a dominant feeling. 8- They usually try to maintain the status quo and thus may not be progressive. 9- They usually do not take risks and are not adventurous. 10- Within their group, they usually tend to be dependent and cooperative rather than competitive. Present-oriented people: 1- They tend to focus on the present and their current sensations, feelings, and concerns while ignoring commitments made in the past or for the future; thus they are more concerned with ""what is"" than ""what was"" or ""what may be"". 2- Their thinking is more concrete rather than abstract (i.e. one hundred dollar right now is much better than two hundred dollars in the future). 3- It is difficult for them to give up temptations or delay gratification and thus they are easily distracted from the performance of necessary current tasks and tend to be procrastinators. 4- They tend to concentrate on activities that bring pleasure and avoid pain. 5- Their knowledge or insight may not deter them from performing actions that may not be beneficial to them. 6- They are usually more sensation and novelty seekers, more aggressive, more depressed, less conscientious, and less emotionally stable. They have less concern for future consequences, less ego and impulse control, and less preference for consistency. They also tend to lie. 7- Usually people who are poor or uneducated tend to be present-oriented since they usually tend to focus on emergent needs of the present. 8- Since they are not good in abstract thinking, are more concerned with immediate gratification, and less concerned about the future, they usually tend to get low grades in school. 9- Because they are immediate pleasure seekers, they usually don't pay good attention to their health and can additionally abuse substances. 10- They are usually considered to be fun people to be around. Future-oriented people: 1- They are more focused on their future than the present or the past; their thoughts are concerned with the future consequences of their present actions; they logically analyze various outcomes that may result from their action. 2- They are goal-oriented and can delay gratification and endure an unpleasant situation in order to achieve long-term goals. They pay attention to responsibility, liability, efficiency, distant payoffs, and tend to optimize future outcomes. Thus they can work hard and avoid temptations, distractions, waste of time to accomplish a goal. They usually tend to rehearse various future plans. 3- Since they are concerned about the future, they tend to save their money and resources. 4- They could be either cooperative or competitive depending on which action results in the best outcome. 5- They tend to be health-conscious in order to prevent future negative health outcomes. 6- They may be unable to enjoy fun activities due to the fear of wasting time. 7- They may have difficulty in intimate relationships since they thrive on control, predictability, and consistency, factors that may interfere with the freedom and spontaneity of relationships. 8- Although they usually have low anxiety levels, concern for the future may increase their anxiety. They usually tend to be workaholic, and have midlife crises. 9- They tend to be more conscientious, less aggressive, less depressed, more reward-dependent, less sensation seeker, more studious, more creative, and use less addictive drugs and alcohol. 10- They tend to have more self-esteem, energy, openness, ego-control, and grade-point average. Time paradoxes: Four main paradoxes are: 1- Time is one of the most powerful influences on our thoughts, feelings, and actions, yet we are usually totally unaware of the affect of time in our lives. 2- We can buy food, objects, space (i.e. land), but not time. Once we lose time, we lose it forever. 3- Each specific attitude toward time--or time perspective--is associated with numerous benefits, yet in excess each is associated with even greater costs. 4- Individual attitudes toward time are learned through personal experience, yet collectively attitudes toward time influence national destinies.","Profound idea that everyone has a primary time focus: either Future-focused, Present-focused, or Past-focused. Fascinating implications of each. Because I'm so future-focused, reading this book helped me understand people who are very present-focused. Also great advice on shifting your focus when needed. I read it 7 years ago, but still think about it almost every day."
Stumbling on Happiness,Daniel Gilbert,1400077427,10,"How much of what you do is for now, and how much is to please the future you? We do ""good"" things in the charitable service of the people we will soon become. We treat our future selves as though they were our children, constructing tomorrows that we hope will make them happy. The human being is the only animal that thinks about the future. The greatest achievement of the human brain is its ability to imagine objects and episodes that do not exist in the realm of the real, and it is this ability that allows us to think about the future. The human brain is an ""anticipation machine"" and ""making future"" is the most important thing it does. Volunteers imagined themselves requesting a date with a person on whom they had a major crush, and those who had had the most elaborate and delicious fantasies about approaching their heartthrob were *least* likely to do so over the next few months. When people find it easy to imagine an event, they overestimate the likelihood that it will occur. Because we get more practice imagining good events than bad events, we overestimate the likelihood that good events will actually happen to us, which leads us to be unrealistically optimistic about our futures. Although citizens of other nations are not as optimistic as Americans, they also tend to imagine that their futures will be brighter than those of their peers. Fear, worry, and anxiety have useful roles to play in our lives. We motivate by dramatizing the unpleasant consequences of misbehaviors by imagining the unpleasant tomorrows. The most important reason why our brains insist on simulating the future is that our brains want to control the experiences we are about to have. If we lose our ability to control things, we become unhappy, helpless, hopeless, and depressed. People often act as though they can control the uncontrollable. People bet more money on games of chance when their opponents seem incompetent than competent - as though they believed they could control the random drawing of cards from a deck and thus take advantage of a weak opponent. People feel more certain that they will win a lottery if they can control the number on their ticket, and they feel more confident that they will win a dice toss if they can throw the dice themselves. People will wager more money on dice that have not yet been tossed than on dice that have already been tossed but whose outcome is not yet known, and they will bet more if they, rather than someone else, are allowed to decide which number will count as a win. All of these are absolutely absurd if they believed they had no control over an uncontrollable event. Subjectivity : the fact that experience is unobservable to everyone but the person having it. Remembering yellow: 73% of people not-describing a remembered color remembered it. Only 33% of those that described it in-between remembered it. Describing the color impaired rather than improved performance. Verbal descriptions overwrote their memories. No one knows what happiness really is. Therefore we should never say we are happy until we are dead because otherwise, if the real thing ever does come along, we will have used up the word and won't have any way to tell the newspapers about it. Volunteers showed quiz-show questions, and asked to estimate the likelihood that they could answer them correctly. Volunteers who saw only the questions thought they were difficult. Volunteers who saw both the question and the answer believed they could have answered the questions easily had they never seen the answers at all. ^ Once we have an experience, we cannot simply set it aside and see the world as we would have seen it had the experience never happened. The jury cannot disregard the prosecutor's snide remarks. To say an experience that once brought me pleasure no longer does? A man given a drink of water in the desert may rate his happiness at that moment as an 8/8. A year later, that same drink might make him feel no better than a 2/8. Are we to believe he was wrong about how happy he was in the desert, or that a sip of water can be a source of ecstasy or a source of moisture depending on one's experiential background? The moment we encounter an object, our brains instantly analyze just a few of its key features and then use the presence or absence of these features to make one very fast simple decision: ""Is this object an important thing to which I ought to respond right now?"" Numbfeel : It is possible - at least for some of the people some of the time - to be happy, sad, bored, or curious, and not know it. Our brain offers us an interpretation of the way things are. Because those interpretations are usually so good, we do not realize that we are seeing an interpretation. Instead, we feel as though we are sitting comfortably inside our heads, looking out though the clear glass windshield of our eyes, watching the world as it really is. We forget that our brains are talented forgers, weaving a tapestry of memory and perception whose detail is so compelling that its inauthenticity is rarely detected. The mistake we make when we unthinkingly accept the validity of our memories and perceptions is the same mistake we make when we imagine our futures. Seeing in time is like seeing in space. When things are far away (in space) they are vague and lacking in detail. We do not mistakenly conclude that the far-away thing is vague and lacking in detail. But when we remember or imagine a distant (in time) event, our brains seem to overlook the fact that details vanish, and we conclude that the distant events are as vague as we are imagining and remembering them. For example, have you ever wondered why you often make commitments that you deeply regret when the moment to fulfill them arrives? When we said yes, we were thinking in terms of why instead of how, in terms of causes of consequences instead of execution, and we failed to consider the fact that the detail-free event we were imagining would not be the detail-laden event we would actually experience. Doing something next month is ""an act of love"", whereas doing it right now is ""an act of lunch"". When volunteers are asked to ""imagine a good day"", they imagine a greater variety of events if the good day is tomorrow than if the good day is a year later. Tomorrow is imagined in considerable detail, as mix of good stuff and unpleasant stuff. A good day a year later is imagined as a smooth purée of happy episodes. When asked, they think the mental images of the near and far futures are equally realistic. Curiosity : people given boring quiz asked (beforehand) if they'd prefer a candy bar at the end or to know the answers. Everyone predicted they'd want the candy bar. But after the test, even though the questions were trite, people chose to know the answers over the candy bar. Like a mystery novel, couldn't stand not knowing. Just as imagination previews objects, so does it prefeel events. Before making a choice, some volunteers were asked to think logically, whereas others were asked to make their choice quickly and ""from the gut"". When asked days later about the result of their decision, the thinkers were least satisfied. Nonthinkers trusted their prefeelings: if imagining the future made them feel good, choosing that choice would make them feel good, and they were right. Prefeeling allowed nonthinkers to predict their future satisfaction more accurately than thinkers did. When people are prevented from feeling emotion in the present, they become temporarily unable to predict how they will feel in the future. When we ask our brains to look at a real object and an imaginary object at the same time, our brains choose the real object. (Eyes open and looking at something overrides imagining something.) When we try to ignore our current gloomy state and make a forecast about how we will feel tomorrow, we find it's a lot like trying to imagine the taste of marshmallow while chewing liver. It's only natural that we should imagine the future and then consider how doing so makes us feel, but because our brains are hell-bent on responding to current events, we mistakenly conclude that we will feel tomorrow as we feel today. Volunteers in a no-variety group were more satisfied than volunteers in the variety group. Variety made people less happy, not more. Wonderful things are especially wonderful the first time they happen, but their wonderfulness wanes with repetition. (Think about the first time your love said ""I love you"", versus the 100th time.) Time and variety are two ways to avoid habituation, and if you have one, then you don't need the other. When episodes are sufficiently separated in time, variety is not only unnecessary, it can actually be costly. Starting points have a profound impact on ending points. Starting points matter because we often end up close to where we started. When people predict future feelings by imagining a future event as though it were happening in the present and then correcting for the event's actual location in time, they make the same error. People prefer to have a job that pays $30k, then $40k, then $50k - rather than a job that earns $60k, then $50k, then $40k, even though the latter would earn more money. We don't think in absolute dollars. We think of relative dollars. (We would drive across town to save $50 on a $100 radio, but not to save $50 on a $100,000 car.) If you ask someone to pay an unrealistically large cost (""could you commit to coming to our rally every weekend this summer?"") before asking them to pay a smaller amount (""ok then could you at least contribute $20?"") - they're much more likely to agree to pay the small cost after having contemplated the large one, in part because doing so makes the small cost seem so bearable. People are more likely to purchase a vacation package that has been marked down from $600 to $500 than an identical package that costs $400 that was on sale the previous day for $300. We end up prefering bad deals that have become decent deals to great deals that were once amazing deals. People don't like to buy the most expensive item in a category, so retailers can improve their sales by stocking a few very expensive items that no one actually buys (a $500 bottle of champagne) that makes less expensive items seem like a bargain by comparison (a $60 champagne). Realestate people often bring clients to shitholes first, so that the ordinary house feels like a miracle in comparison. People were given the opportunity to bid on a dictionary that was in perfect condition and had 10,000 words. They bid $24. Others given the opportunity to bid on a dictionary with a torn cover but 20,000 words. They bid $20. When a different group was able to compare them side-by-side, they bid $19 for the small intact dictionary and $27 for the large torn dictionary. People care about an attribute (# of words) only when it is brought to their attention by side-by-side comparison. What do all these facts about comparison mean for our ability to imagine future feelings? (a) - value is determined by the comparison of one thing to another (b) - there is more than one kind of comparison we can make in any given instance (c) - we may value something more highly when we make one kind of comparison than when we make a different kind of comparison. If we want to predict how something will make us feel in the future, we must consider the kind of comparison we will be making in the future, and not the kind of comparison we happen to be making in the present. When we start shopping for a new pair of sunglasses, we compare the cool new ones in the store with the old outdated ones on our nose. But a few days after buying the new ones, we stop comparing them with the old pair and the delight that the comparison produced is gone. ""Presentism"": judging historical figures by contemporary standards. Condemning Thomas Jefferson for keeping slaves or Sigmund Freud for patronizing women is like arresting someone today for having driven without a seat belt in 1923. People who don't have dire reactions to tragic events are sometimes diagnosed as having ""absent grief"". Recent research shows conventional wisdom is wrong, that the absence of grief is quite normal, and most people are surprisingly resilient in the face of trauma. When people are asked to predict how they'll feel if a bad event occurs, they consistently overestimate how awful they'll feel and how long they'll feel awful. Researchers asked volunteers to write down their definition of ""talented"", then to estimate their talent using that definition as a guide. Other volunteers were given the definitions that the first group had written down and were asked to estimate their own talent using those definitions as a guide. The ones who defined ""talented"" rated themselves as more talented than the non-definers. Because definers were given the liberty to define the word talented any way they wished, they defined it exactly as wished - in terms of some activity at which they happened to excel. Because experiences are inherently ambiguous, finding a positive view of an experience is done well and often. Racetrack gamblers evaluate their horses more positively when they are leaving the betting window than when they are approaching it. Same with voters. Objects are fine on their own, but when they become *our* objects, they are instantly finer. People are adept at finding a positive way to view things once those things become their own. We cannot do without reality and we cannot do without illusion. Each serves a purpose, each imposes a limit on the influence of the other, and our experience of the world is inbetween. When volunteers in one study were told that they'd scored poorly on an IQ test, and were then given an opportunity to peruse articles about IQ tests, they spent more time reading articles that questioned the validity of such tests than articles that sanctioned them. When volunteers in another study were given a glowing evaluation by a supervisor, they were more interested in reading background information that praised the supervisor's competence and acumen than background information that impeached it. Half a group was shown that extraverts are more successful. Other half shown that introverts are more successful. Then when asked to recall events from their past to help determine which they were, they remembered just the events that support the successful group they were told. We spent countless hours and dollars arranging our lives to ensure that we are surrounded by people who like us, and people who are like us. A question such as ""Am I the best lover you've ever had?"" is dangerous because it has only one answer that can make us truly happy. ""What do you like best about my lovemaking?"" is brilliant because it has only one answer that can make us truly miserable. 96% of cancer patients claim to be in better health than the average cancer patient. If we can't find people who are doing more poorly than we are, we create them. Volunteers in one study took a test and were given the opportunity to provide hints that would either help or hinder a friend's performance on the same test. When described as a game, they gave helpful hints. When described as an intelligence test, they gave hindering hints. Although the word ""fact"" seems to suggest an unquestionable irrefutability, facts are nothing more than conjectures that have met a certain standard of proof. If we set that standard high enough, then nothing can ever be proved, including the fact of our own existence. When we want to believe that someone is smart, a single letter of recommendation may suffice. When we don't want to believe that person is smart, we may demand a thick envelope full of transcripts, tests, and testimony. It doesn't take much to convince us that we are smart and healthy, but it takes a lot of facts to convince us of the opposite. People are typically unaware of the reasons why they are doing what they are doing, but when asked for a reason, they readily supply one. Listening to a piece of music, some volunteers were told to just listen, while others were told to listen while consciously trying to be happy. The volunteers who had tried to be happy were in a worse mood than the ones who had simply listened. Why? (1) deliberate attempts to be happy tend to backfire and we end up feeling worse than we did before. (2) deliberate attempts to cook the facts are so transparent that they make us feel cheap. Nobody wants to be stood up at the altar, but those who have had it happen say it was the best thing that happened to them. Like so many things, getting jilted is more painful in prospect and more rosy in retrospect. Most people think they will regret foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But 90% of them are wrong. People in all walks of life seem to regret NOT having done things much more than they regret things they did. The most popular regrets are not going to college, not grasping profitable business opportunities, and not spending enough time with family and friends. It's harder to manufacture positive and credible views of inactions than actions. When our inactions cause regret, we can't console ourselves by thinking of all the things we learned from the experience because there wasn't one. The intensity of suffering triggers defensive systems, which work to help them achieve a credible and positive view of their experience. When people are given electric shocks, they actually feel less pain when they believe they are suffering for something of great value. The intense shocks were unpleasant enough to trigger their psychological defenses, but the mild shocks were not, hence they valued the club most when its initiation was painful. That's why you can forgive your spouse for cheating but stay angry about the dishes. You may ultimately feel better when you are the victim of an insult than when you are bystander to it. We're more likely to look for and find a positive view of the things we're stuck with than of the things we're not. It is only when we cannot change the experience that we look for ways to change our view of the experience. We find silver linings only when we must. People try to explain events. When people do not complete the things they set out to do, they are especially likely to think about and remember their unfinished business. Once we explain an event, we can fold it up nicely, put it away in memory's drawer, and move on to the next one. But if an event defies explanation, it becomes a mystery or a conundrum, which refuse to stay in the back of our mind. People choose certainty over uncertainty and clarity over mystery, despite the fact that in both cases clarity and certainty had been shown to diminish happiness. We naturally (but incorrectly) assume that things that come easily to mind are things we have frequently encountered. Infrequent or unusual experiences are the most memorable. The fact that the least likely experience is often the most likely memory can wreak havoc with our ability to predict future experiences. Memory's fetish for endings explains why women often remember childbirth as less painful than it really was, and why couples whose relationships have gone sour remember that they were never really happy in the first place. Genes tend to be transmitted when they make us do things that transmit genes. Wealth increases happiness when it lifts people out of poverty into middle class, but it does little to increase happiness thereafter. Economies grow only if people are deluded into believing that the production of wealth will make them happy. The belief that children are a source of happiness becomes a part of our cultural wisdom simply because the opposite belief unravels the fabric of any society that holds it. One way to make predictions about our own emotional futures is to find someone who is having the experience we are contemplating and ask them how they feel. The best way to predict our feelings tomorrow is to see how others are feeling today. The average person doesn't see themselves as average. Most students see themselves as more intelligent than the average student. Most business managers see themselves as more competent than the average business manager. Most football players see themselves as having better sense than their teammates. 90% of motorists consider themselves to be safer-than-average drivers. 94% of college professors consider themselves to be better-than-average teachers. Ironically, our bias towards seeing ourselves as better than average causes us to see ourselves as less biased than average, too. This is general tendency to think of ourselves as different from others - often for better but sometimes for worse. When people are asked about generosity, they claim to perform a greater number of generous acts than others do, but when asked about selfishness, they claim to perform a greater number of selfish acts than others do. When people are asked about their ability to perform an easy task, (driving, bike-riding), they rate themselves better than others, but when asked about their ability to perform a difficult task (juggling or playing chess), they rate themselves as worse than others. We don't always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique. Surrogation is a cheap and effective way to predict one's future emotions, but because we don't realize just how similar we all are, we reject this reliable method and rely instead on our imaginations, as flawed and fallible as they may be.","Not at all new-agey, as the title might suggest. Harvard professor of psychology has studied happiness for years, and shares factual findings that will change the way you look at the world."
E-Myth Revisited,Michael Gerber,0887307280,10,"Fatal assumption : if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. The technical work of a business, and a business that does that technical work are two totally different things. The technician is forced to learn how to make the business work, rather than do the work himself. Every technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure experiences the same thing: 1. Exhiliration, 2. Terror, 3. Exhaustion, 4. Despair - a terrible sense of loss, loss of special relationship with their work, loss of purpose, loss of self. == ENTREPRENEUR, MANAGER, TECHNICIAN Everybody who goes into business is actually three people in one: The Entrepreneur dreams The Manager frets The Technician ruminates While each of these personalities wants to be the boss, none of them wants to have a boss. The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He's happiest when left free to construct images of ""what if"" and ""if when"". In business, the Entrepreneur is the innovator, grand strategist, creator of new methods. Given his need for change, the Entrepreneur creates a great deal of havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists in his projects. The entrepreneur builds a house and the instant it's done begins planning the next one. The Manager craves order, compulsively clings to the status quo. While entrepreneur sees opportunities, manager sees the problems. The Manager creates neat orderly rows of things. The Entrepreneur creates the things that the manager puts in rows. The Manager is the one who runs after the Entrepreneur to clean up the mess. Without the Entrepreneur there would be no mess to clean up. Technician is the doer : ""if you want something done right, do it yourself"". As long as the Technician is working, he is happy, but only on one thing at a time. He knows he can't get things done simultaneously, so he works steadily and is happiest when he is in control of the work flow. If the three were equally balanced, we'd be describing an incredibly competent individual. The Entrepreneur would be free to forge ahead into new areas of interest. The Manager would be solidifying the base of operations. The Technician would be doing the technical work. Without all three of these personalities being given opportunity, the freedom, the nourishment they each need to grow, your business cannot help but mirror your own lopsidedness. An Entrepreneur does the work of envisioning the business as something apart from you, the owner. The work of asking all the right questions about WHY this business, opposed to that business? == INFANCY Unfortunately most business do what the owner wants as opposed to what the business needs. It's easy to spot a business in infancy : the owner and business are one and the same. Infancy ends when the owner realizes the business cannot continue to run the way it has been, that to survive it will have to change. This is where most business failures occur. If your business depends on you, you don't own a business - you have a job. (and you're working for a lunatic) The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people. == ADOLESCENCE Error: Management by abdication (""To relinquish formally a high office or responsibility."") rather than delegation. The process of deterioration where the number of the balls in the air is not only too much for you, but too much for your people as well. == BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE True trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith. To know, one must understand. To understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions are truly present. What people know, do, want, are - and what they don't/aren't. A business that ""gets small again"" is a business reduced to the level of its owner's personal resistance to change - its owner's comfort zone. (works and waits for something positive to happen) Businesses that ""get small again"" die, implode. Your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth. To educate yourself so that, as your business grows, the foundation and structure can carry the additional weight. ** It's up to you to dictate your business's rate of growth by understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you're aiming for in the marketplace. Write it down, clearly, so others can understand it. (If you can't, you don't own it!) == MATURITY Maturity is not an inevitable result of the first two phases. It is not the end of a serial process. Great companies didn't end up as mature companies - they started out that way. Mature company must also go through infancy and adolescence, but go through them in a different way. It's the perspective that makes the difference. Very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was done. How it would act. Unless you act that way from the beginning, you'll never get there. In order to become a great company, act like a great company long before it ever becomes one. Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business. We didn't do business at IBM, we built one. The very best businesses are fashioned after a model of a business that works. How must the business work? Business as a system for producing outside results - for the customer - resulting in profits. Picture of a well-defined future, then comes back to the present with the intention of changing it to match the vision. Survey the world and ask, ""Where is the opportunity?"" Identify it, then go back to the drawing board and construct a solution to the frustration found in a group of customers. Acts the way the customer needs it to act, not the Entrepreneur. ""How will my business look to the customer?"" ""How will my business stand out from all the rest?"" Within the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants, begging to be satisfied. Find out what those wants are, and what they will be in the future. == THE TURN-KEY REVOLUTION / FRANCHISE PROTOTYPE A systems-dependent business, not a people-dependent business. Integrity : doing what you say you will do, and if you can't : learning how. Franchise prototype is where all assumptions are put to the test to see how well they work before becoming operational in the business. The system runs the business. The people run the system. The system isn't something you bring to the business. It's something you derive from the process of building the business. Entrepreneur : franchise prototype is the medium through which vision takes form in the real world. Manager : franchise prototype provides the order, predictability, system. Technician : franchise prototype is where he is free to do the things he loves to do : the technical work. == WORKING ON YOUR BUSINESS, NOT IN IT Your business is not your life. Your business is something apart from you, with its own rules and its own purposes. An organism that will live or die according to how well it performs its sole function : find and keep customers. The primary purpose of your business is to serve your life (not vice-versa) Make a perfect prototype for 5000 more just like it. Exactly like it, not just similar. Franchise model: 1. provides consistent value to customers, employees, etc - beyond what they expect 2. operated by people with the lowest possible skill 3. a place of impecable order 4. all work documented in operations manuals 5. provides uniformly predictable service to the customer 6. uses uniform color, dress, facilities code Lowest possible level of skill necessary to fulfill the functions for which each is intended. Of course, in a legal firm you need attorneys, medical, physicians. But you don't need to hire brilliant attorneys or physicians. Create the very best system through which good attorneys and good physicians can be leveraged to produce exquisite results. How can I give my customer the results he wants systematically rather than personally? How can I create a business whose results are systems-dependent rather than people-dependent or expert-dependent? How can I create an expert system rather than hire one? Great business are not built by extraordinary people, but by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Develop those tools and teach your people how to use them. People's job is to use the tools you've developed and recommend improvements based on their experience with them. NO : Typical owner of a small business prefers highly skilled people because he believes they make his job easier - he can simply leave the work to them. Unfortunately then the business grows to depend on the whims and moods of its people. If they're in the mood, the job gets done. If they're not, it doesn't. In this kind of business, ""How do I motivate my people?"" comes up : ""How do I keep them in the mood?"" It is literally impossible to create a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people. When you intentionally build your business around the skills of ordinary people, you will be forced to ask the difficult questions about how to produce a result without the extraordinary ones. You will be forced to find a system that leverages your ordinary people to the point where they can produce extraordinary results over and over again. You will be forced to invent innovative system solutions to the people problems that plague businesses. You will be forced to build a business that works. Documentation says, ""This is how we do it here."" Without documentation, all routinized work turns into exceptions. Designates the purpose of the work, specifies the steps needed to be taken while doing that work, and summarizes the standards associated with both the process and result. BARBER story : He was constantly and arbitrarily changing my experience for me. He was in control of my experience, not I. Running the business for him, not me. Deprived me of the experience of making a decision to patronize his business for my own reasons. It didn't matter what I wanted. What you do in your model is not as important as doing what you do the same way, each and every time. * How can I get my business to work without me? * How can I get my people to work without my interference? * How can I systematize my business so it could be replicated thousands of times? * How can I own my business, and still be free of it? * How can I spend my time doing the work I love to do rather than the work I have to do? == BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS People constantly asking, ""What is the best way to do this?"" - knowing we'll never discover the best way, but by asking we discover a better way. Innovation is the ""best way"" skill. It produces a high level of energy in every company. Quantification : numbers related to the impact an innovation makes. Quantify EVERYTHING related to how you do business. Eventually, you and your people will think of your entire business in terms of the numbers. Read your business' health chart by the flow of the numbers. Know which numbers are critical and which aren't. Become as familiar with your business' numbers as a doctor is with blood pressure / pulse rates. Without the numbers, you don't know where you are or where you're going. With the numbers, your business will take on a totally new meaning. Orchestration is the elimination of discretion or choice at the operating level of your business. Without orchestration, nothing could be planned or anticipated by you or your customer. If you're doing everything differently every time you do it, if everyone is doing it at their own discretion, you're creating chaos, not order. If you haven't orchestrated it, you don't own it. If you don't own it, you can't depend on it. Unless your unique way of doing business can be replicated every single time, you don't own it. Unless your customer gets everything he wants every time, he'll go someplace else to get it. The business development process is not static - it's not something you do and then are done with - it's something you do all the time. Innovation, Quantification, Orchestration are the backbone of a business - the Business Development Process. == BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM Your... 1. Primary Aim 2. Strategic Objective 3. Organizational Strategy 4. Management Strategy 5. People Strategy 6. Marketing Strategy 7. Systems Strategy == PRIMARY AIM: What do I value most? What kind of life do I want? What do I want my life to look like, to feel like? How do I wish my day-to-day to be? What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life? Who do I wish to be? How would I like to be with other people in my life : my family, friends, business associates, customers, employees? How would I like people to think about me? 2 years from now? 10? 20? End of life? What specifically would I like to learn during my life : spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually, about relationships? Begin living your life as if it were important. Take it seriously. Create it intentionally. == STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: Your strategic objective is a very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim. The first standard is gross revenues. How big will your company be when it's finally done? Know your gross profits, pretax profits, after-tax profits. You can't know all this, but any standards are better than no standards. Does the business I have in mind alleviate a frustration experienced by a large enough group of consumers to make it worth my while? Central demographic model : a most probable customer. == ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY The organizational development reflected in the Organizational Chart can have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single business development step. More companies organize around personalities rather than around functions. (& the result is chaos) Make a chart of positions : COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP Finance, Sales manager, Advertising/Research manager, Production manager, Service manager, Facilities manager, Accounts receivable manager, Accounts payable manager. (clear tree of who reports to who) A position contract : a summary of the results to be achieved by each position in the company, the work that position is accountable for, a list of standards by which results are to be evaluated. Sign off on it. Not a job description, it is a contract between the company, employee, and a summary of the rules of the game. It provides each person with a sense of commitment and accountability. Look at each position as a franchise prototype of its own. When one goes to work in a position, one goes to work ON a position, implementing the business development process of innovation, quantification, orchestration. Don't hire someone with experience. Not a master technician. A novice, a beginner, an apprentice. Someone eager to learn how to do it right. Willing to learn what you've spent so much time and energy discovering. Someone who is open to the possibility of learning skills not developed yet, skills he/she wants to learn. If you don't obey the rules, honor them, extol them, why should you expect anyone else to take your game seriously? == MANAGEMENT STRATEGY You may think your plan depends on highly skilled people. It doesn't. You don't need such people. You can't afford them. They will become the bane of your existence. What you need is a mangement system. The system will become your management strategy, and produces the results you want. The system will become your solution to the problems of unpredictable people, by orchestrating the process by which management decisions are made, while eliminating the need for such decisions whenever possible. A management system is a system designed into your prototype to produce a marketing result. The more automatic that system is, the more effective your franchise prototype will be. Management development - the process through which you create your management system, and teach up-and-upcoming managers to use it, isn't a management tool - it's a marketing tool. Its purpose is not just to create an efficient prototype but an effective one : one that finds and keeps customers, profitably, better than any other. (HOTEL STORY HERE) == PEOPLE STRATEGY ""How do I get my people to do what I want?"" You can't get your people to do anything. If you want it done, create an environment where ""doing it"" is more important to them than not doing it. Where ""doing it"" well becomes a way of life. The work we do is a reflection of who we are. If we're sloppy at it, it's because we're sloppy inside. If we're late, it's because we're late inside. If we're bored, we're bored inside. The most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist. So the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves. Make sure they understand the idea behind the work they're being asked to do. An idea more important than the work itself. Everyone who works here is expected to work towards being the best he can possibly be at the tasks he's accountable for. When he can't do that, he should act like he is. If unwilling to act, leave. A business is like a martial arts practice hall - a dojo - a place you go to practice being the best you can be. A game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the owner, have about the world. The degree to which they buy into your game doesn't depend on them but on how well you communicate the game to them - at the outset of the relationship - not after it's begun. Your People Strategy is the way you communicate your idea. 1. Never try to make a game out of what you want your people to do. The game has to come first, what your people do comes second. (?) 2. Never create a game you're unwilling to play yourself. 3. Make sure there are ways of winning the game without ending it. (never actually end it, but give occasional victories) 4. Change the game from time to time : the tactics, not the strategy. (any game can become boring, no matter how extraordinary it was. anticipate the end before anyone else does, and change it by executive action) 5. Remind people of the game, constantly. Once a week, have a meeting about the game. Once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception to the way the game has been played, and make certain everyone knows about it. 6. The game has to make sense. 7. The game needs to be fun from time to time. (not all the time) 8. If you can't think of a good game, steal one. The hiring process is the first and most essential medium for communicating the Boss' idea. HIRING: 1. scripted presentation communicating the Boss' idea in a group meeting to all the applicants at once. describe the idea, history, successful experience implementing the idea, attributes required of the successful candidate for the position. 2. meeting with each applicant individually to discuss reactions and feelings about the idea, as well as his background and experience. ask why they feel they're great for the role in implementing the idea. 3. notify successful candidate by phone. 4. notify unsuccessful applicants, thanking for their interest. 5. first day of training: - reviewing boss' idea - summarizing the system - take a tour of facilities, highlighting people at work, systems at work, to demonstrate the interdependence of systems on people and people on systems - answering employee's questions fully - give operations manual - review operations manual - completing employment papers Don't hire experienced managers, because they'll manage by standards they learned somewhere else. You must take full accountability for what's going on in your business. You must lead the company in the direction you intend it to go. You must set the standard. The Management System : all managers and future-managers are expected to produce results. You don't need professional managers to manage to those standards : just people who wish to learn how to manage them. People who are personally committed to those standards as you are. You need people who want to play your game. Not people who believe they have a better one. Hierarchy of systems: (where the ""it"" is the stated purpose of your business.) 1 : how we do it here 2 : how we recruit, hire, and train people to do it here 3 : how we manage it here 4 : how we change it here == MARKETING STRATEGY: When it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant. It's what your customer wants that matters. What your customer wants is probably different that what he thinks he wants. Make a promise the customer wants to hear, then deliver on that promise better than anyone else on the block. The COO is the driver of all of this. The COO connects each part of the business process. The COO maintains the integrity of the whole. == SYSTEMS STRATEGY: A system is a set of things, actions, ideas, and information that interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems. (?) Information is the glue that holds your system strategy together. It tells you when and why you need to change.","Absolutely everyone who is an entrepreneur or wants to be one needs to read this book. I first read it after 10 years of successfully running my company, and was still blown away and totally humbled by its wisdom. Re-reading it today, I'm amazed how my view of business was completely changed by this one little book. See my notes for examples, but definitely read the book itself to get the real impact."
Skin in the Game,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,0425284646,9,"Have exposure to the real world. Pay a price for its consequences. The knowledge we get by experience and the workings of time is vastly superior to that obtained through reasoning. Freeing ourselves from having warriors at the top does not mean civilization and progress. You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can. Atheists refuse the notion of design by a creator who knows everything, while at the same time, they want to impose human design as if they knew all the consequences. We know with much more clarity what is bad than what is good. Universal behavior is great on paper, disastrous in practice. Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice. Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk. Do your theories. Don’t tell people in the real world how to apply them. Let people select what they need. Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication. There is no benefit for them to propose something simple: when you are rewarded for perception, not results, you need to show sophistication. When there was risk on the line, suddenly a second brain in me manifested itself. When there is fire, you will run faster than in any competition. I become dumb again when there was no real action. If you muster the strength, the strength gained will stay after things calm down. What you learn from the intensity and the focus you had when under the influence of risk stays with you. Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it. I have no other definition of success than leading an honorable life. Anything you do to optimize your work, cut some corners, or squeeze more “efficiency” out of it (and out of your life) will eventually make you dislike it. Artisans have their soul in the game. Artisans do things for existential reasons first, financial and commercial ones later. Villainy takes the short road, virtue the longer one. Have no assistant. The mere presence of an assistant suspends your natural filtering. Its absence forces you to do only things you enjoy, and progressively steer your life that way. (By assistant here I exclude someone hired for a specific task, such as grading papers, helping with accounting, or watering plants; just some guardian angel overseeing all your activities.) To “explain” to an assistant how to do things requires more mental effort than doing the thing itself. Having an assistant (except for the strictly necessary) removes your soul from the game. Entrepreneurs fail for the rest of us. Many entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game in the sense that their aim is to either cash out by selling the company they helped create to someone else, or “go public” by issuing shares in the stock market. The true value of the company, what it makes, and its long-term survival are of small relevance to them. This is a pure financing scheme and we will exclude this class of people from our “entrepreneur” risk-taker class (this form of entrepreneurship is the equivalent of bringing great-looking and marketable children into the world with the sole aim of selling them at age four). We can easily identify them by their ability to write a convincing business plan. Products or companies that bear the owner’s name convey very valuable messages. They are shouting that they have something to lose. Eponymy indicates both a commitment to the company and a confidence in the product. There is something offensive in having a nationality without skin in the game, just to travel and pass borders, without the downside that comes with the passport. Unless I developed an emotional attachment to France via skin in the game, I couldn’t take French citizenship. But I came to the U.S., embraced the place, and took the passport as commitment: it became my identity, good or bad, tax or no tax. If wanted to lower taxes for myself, and I do, I am obligated to fight for it, for both myself and the collective, other taxpayers, and to not run away. The thing you can learn from a professor is how to be a professor. The thing you can learn from a life coach or inspirational speaker is how to become a life coach or inspirational speaker. It is not irrational to leave money on the table because of your personal preference. Incentives are not limited to financial gain. Subcontracting my research and writing would (perhaps) increase my productivity, but deprive me of my identity. People want to have their soul in the game. Just to do things, because they feel it is part of their identity. A shoemaker wants to be a shoemaker. Even if his so-called “economic” condition might benefit from letting a Chinese factory make the shoes and converting to another profession. Even if such a new system allows him to buy fancy things, something is missing. It may be cruel to cheat people of their profession. If you can’t put your soul into something, give it up and leave that stuff to someone else. Learning is rooted in repetition and convexity, meaning that the reading of a single text twice is more profitable than reading two different things once. Beware of the person who gives advice, telling you that a certain action on your part is “good for you” while it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him. Laws come and go; ethics stay. Sympathy for all would be tyranny for thee, my good neighbor. The more confined our ethics, the less abstract, the better it works. People get along better as neighbors than roommates. Commons: a space in which you are treated by others the way you treat them. I am: at the Fed level, libertarian at the state level, Republican at the local level, Democrat at the family and friends level, a socialist. I own no Microsoft stock, I am short no Microsoft stock, hence I can’t talk about it. Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio. People may hate McDonald’s, but they certainly hate uncertainty even more. All it takes is a small number of intolerant, virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly. This is the equivalent of entering a game in which one needed to not just win more points than the adversary, but win 97 percent of the total points just to be safe. One in a family of four eats only non-GMO food (which includes organic). This one imposes her rule on the four and now all will opt for non-GMO. Now the family goes to a BBQ party attended by three other families. As they are known to only eat non-GMO, the hosts will cook only organic. The local grocery store, realizing the neighborhood is only non-GMO, switches to non-GMO to simplify life, which impacts the local wholesaler. ... and the system continues to renormalize. Once you have 10 percent or more women at a party, you cannot serve only beer. But most men will drink wine. So you only need one set of glasses. If one of the persons in the room doesn’t speak German, the entire meeting will be run in English. All it takes is a few (motivated) activists for the banning of some books, or the blacklisting of some people. It is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights. It took seven or eight Poles to help one Jew. It took only one Pole, acting as an informer, to turn in a dozen Jews. An intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, it will eventually destroy our world. So, we need to be more than intolerant with some intolerant minorities. Markets aren’t the sum of market participants, but price changes reflect the activities of the most motivated buyer and seller. That's why a price can drop by ten percent because of a single seller. All you need is a stubborn seller. Leadership: Better to have an army of sheep led by a lion than an army of lions led by a sheep. There's a large payoff from stubborn courage. A small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. The underlying structure of reality matters much more than the participants. Under the right market structure, a collection of idiots produces a well-functioning market. Populate markets with zero intelligence agents, that is buying and selling randomly, under some structure such that a proper auction process matches bids and offers in a regular way. And guess what? We get the same allocative efficiency as if market participants were intelligent. Leave people alone under a good structure and they will take care of things. People who are employees for a living don’t behave so opportunistically. Contractors are exceedingly free. Employees are expensive. Bu you are buying dependability. Cursing today is a status symbol. The highest status, that of a free man, is usually indicated by voluntarily adopting the mores of the lowest class. English “manners” were imposed on the middle class as a way of domesticating them, along with instilling in them the fear of breaking rules and violating social norms. What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing. The more you have to lose, the more fragile you are. Intellectual and ethical freedom requires the absence of the skin of others in one’s game. Always do more than you talk. And precede talk with action. Action without talk supersedes talk without action. Rich people believe in one tax dollar one vote. Humanists ones in one man one vote. Monsanto in one lobbyist one vote. IYI believes in one Ivy League degree one vote. You do not create dynamic equality just by raising the level of those at the bottom, but rather by making the rich rotate - or by forcing people to incur the possibility of creating an opening. The way to make society more equal is by forcing the rich to be subjected to the risk of exiting from the 1 percent. Someone who is rich should never be certain to stay rich. No downside for some means no upside for the rest. Traders, when they make profits, have short communications; when they lose they drown you in details, theories, and charts. Things that have survived are hinting to us ex post that they have some robustness - conditional on their being exposed to harm. Things' life expectancy lengthens with time, conditional on survival. Use laws that are old but food that is fresh. Burn old logs. Drink old wine. Read old books. Keep old friends. Judge their political system by asking not whether it made sense but whether it worked. A free person does not need to win arguments - just win. Rich name-droppers attend cocktail parties where you see only people who are famous. There are rich people whose lives revolve around these things. They usually claim to be trying to save the world, the bears, the children, the mountains, the deserts - all the ingredients of the broadcasting of virtue. If you spend your time trying to impress others in the New York club 21, there may be something wrong with you. Contemporary peers are valuable collaborators, not final judges. The longer an idea has been around without being falsified, the longer its future life expectancy. We know the wrong better than what’s right. Madness is rare in individuals, but in groups, parties, nations, it is the rule. Human nature knows no upper bound, as if to punish itself. When a patient shows up with a headache, it is much better to give him aspirin or recommend a good night’s sleep than do brain surgery, although the latter appears to be more scientific. People without skin in the game seek the complicated and centralized, and avoid the simple like the plague. Practitioners, on the other hand, have opposite instincts, looking for the simplest heuristics. Use education in reverse: hire, conditional on an equal set of skills, the person with the least label-oriented education. It means that the person had to succeed in spite of the credentialization of his competitors and overcome more serious hurdles. In addition, people who didn’t go to Harvard are easier to deal with in real life. Real gyms don’t look like gyms. The rich start using “experts” and “consultants.” An entire industry meant to swindle you will swindle you: financial consultants, diet advisors, exercise experts, lifestyle engineers, sleeping councilors, breathing specialists, etc. Most people are happier in close quarters, in a real barrio-style neighborhood, where they can feel human warmth and company. But when they have big bucks they end up pressured to move into outsized, impersonal, and silent mansions, far away from neighbors. Some things can be, simply, too large for your heart. If wealth is giving you fewer options instead of more (and more varied) options, you’re doing it wrong. The classical art of conversation is to avoid any imbalance. People need to be equal, at least for the purpose of the conversation, otherwise it fails. It has to be hierarchy-free and equal in contribution. You’d rather have dinner with your friends than with your professor. Web-shaming is much more powerful than past reputational blots, and more of a tail risk. “I will save people from drowning only if others too save other people from drowning.” They want others to do so as well - they require a systemic solution to every local perceived problem. If your private life conflicts with your intellectual opinion, it cancels your intellectual ideas, not your private life. If your private actions do not generalize, then you cannot have general ideas. Hotel bathroom signs: “PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT”. They want you to hold off from sending the towels to the laundry and reuse them for a while, because avoiding excess laundry saves them tens of thousands of dollars a year. They wouldn’t advertise it so loudly if it weren’t good for their bottom line. Global causes are the last refuge of the scoundrel advertising virtue. The highest form of virtue is unpopular. Some people only express their opinions as part of mob shaming, when it is safe to do so, and, in the bargain, think that they are displaying virtue. This is not virtue but vice, a mixture of bullying and cowardice. When young people who “want to help mankind” come to me asking, “What should I do? I want to reduce poverty, save the world,” my suggestion is: 1) Never engage in virtue signaling 2) Never engage in rent-seeking 3) You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business. Yes, take risk, and if you get rich (which is optional), spend your money generously on others. In science, belief is literal belief; it is right or wrong, never metaphorical. In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product. This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, and get you out of trouble when needed, or help you find prey at a distance. Your eyes are not sensors designed to capture the electromagnetic spectrum. Their job description is not to produce the most accurate scientific representation of reality; rather the most useful one for survival. Survival comes first; Truth, understanding, and science later. There is no such thing as the “rationality” of a belief, there is rationality of action. The rationality of an action can be judged only in terms of evolutionary considerations. What is rational is that which allows for survival. Religion exists to enforce tail risk management across generations, as its binary and unconditional rules are easy to teach and enforce. Not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason. In real life, every single bit of risk you take adds up to reduce your life expectancy. If you climb mountains and ride a motorcycle and hang around the mob and fly your own small plane and drink absinthe, and smoke cigarettes, and play parkour on Thursday night, your life expectancy is considerably reduced, although no single action will have a meaningful effect. This idea of repetition makes paranoia about some low-probability events, even that deemed “pathological,” perfectly rational. All it takes is for my paranoia to be right once, and it saves my life. Ecocide: the irreversible destruction of our environment.",Taleb is always filled with surprising ideas and confrontational bragging. Ignore the hot air and gather the gems. Great thoughts around putting your ass on the line with consequences — not just thinking things in theory but doing things in reality — in the real world.
This Is Marketing,Seth Godin,0525540830,9,"Marketing in five steps: 1. Invent a thing worth making, with a story worth telling, and a contribution worth talking about. 2. Design and build it in a way that a few people will particularly benefit from and care about. 3. Tell a story that matches the built-in narrative and dreams of that tiny group of people, the smallest viable market. 4. Spread the word. 5. Show up - regularly, consistently, and generously, for years and years - to organize and lead and build confidence in the change you seek to make. Anchor your work deeply in the dreams, desires, and communities of those you seek to serve. Do work that matters for people who care. Making is insufficient. You haven’t made an impact until you’ve changed someone. Resonate with the listener. Tell them something they’ve been waiting to hear. Invite them on a journey where a change might happen. The best way to complain is to make things better. It doesn’t make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open. The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key. If you want to make change, begin by making culture. Begin by organizing a tightly knit group. Begin by getting people in sync. Ask, “Who’s it for?” to focus your actions. Change is best made with intent. “What’s it for?” What you say isn’t nearly as important as what others say about you. People don’t want what you make. They want what it will do for them. They want belonging, connection, peace of mind, status. Humans are lonely. They want to be seen and known. People want to be part of something. Create experiences. Using a product, engaging with a service, calling customer service. Each of these actions is part of the story; each builds a little bit of our connection. Offer these experiences with intent, doing them on purpose. If you have to choose a thousand people to become your true fans, who should you choose? Worldview: A worldview is the shortcut, the lens each of us uses when we see the world. It’s our assumptions and biases and stereotypes about the world around us. Pursuit of mass will make you boring, because mass means average. Begin instead with the smallest viable market. What’s the minimum number of people you would need to influence to make it worth the effort? Be choosy about which people. Choose the people who want what you’re offering. Choose the people most open to hearing your message. Choose the people who will tell the right other people Specific means accountable. It worked or it didn’t. Are you hiding behind everyone or anyone? You’ll never be able to serve everyone, which is comforting, since you’re less likely to be disappointed when it doesn’t happen. Find a corner of the market that can’t wait for your attention. Overwhelm this group’s wants and dreams and desires with your care, your attention, and your focus. Make profound change happen. Figure out the simplest useful version of your product, engage with the market, and then improve and repeat. Loving you is a way of expressing themselves. Becoming part of your movement is an expression of who they are. That love becomes part of their identity, a chance to do something that feels right. To express themselves through their contributions, their actions, and the badge they wear. Instead of talking about prospects and customers, we could call them your “students” instead. What will they benefit from learning? Are they open to being taught? What will they tell others? We must say “It’s not for you.” You’re not going to waste their time, pander to them, or insist that they change their beliefs. It shows respect for those you seek to serve, to say to them, “I made this for you. Not for the other folks, but for you.” I’m doing this for people who believe _________________. I will focus on people who want _________________. I promise that engaging with what I make will help you get _________________. Match the worldview of the people being served. Show up in the world with a story that they want to hear, told in a language they’re eager to understand. Make it easy to spread. If every member brings in one more member, within a few years, you’ll have more members than you can count. Earn, and keep, the attention and trust of those you serve. Offer ways to go deeper. Sonder is defined as that moment when you realize that everyone around you has an internal life as rich and as conflicted as yours. Everyone wants something that they can’t possibly have. And if they could have it, they’d discover that they didn’t really want it all along. Everyone is lonely, insecure, and a bit of a fraud. And everyone cares about something. Find a spot on the map with edges that (some) people want to find. Signal so that people who are looking for you can easily find you. We’re this, not that. Dog food is for dog owners (not dogs). It’s for the way it makes them feel — the satisfaction of taking care of an animal. The people you seek to serve care about a range of inputs and emotions, not simply a contest for who’s the cheapest. Choose your extremes and you choose your market. And vice versa. Neophiliacs = early adopters. Neophiliacs get a thrill from discovery, they enjoy the tension of “This might not work,” and they get pleasure from bragging about their discoveries. Neophiliacs are very forgiving of missteps from those who seek to innovate with them, and incredibly unforgiving after the initial thrill of discovery wears off. You can’t be perfect in the eyes of an early adopter; the best you can do is be interesting. Sometimes, you’ll be creating interesting new work for people who are easily bored. And sometimes, you’ll build products and services that last, that can extend beyond the tiny group of neophiliacs and reach and delight the rest of the market. Draw a simple XY grid. Pick two axes. For each axis, choose something that people care about: Speed Price Convenience Performance Ingredients Purity Sustainability Obviousness Maintenance costs Safety Edginess Distribution Network effect Imminence Visibility Trendiness Privacy Popularity Professionalism Difficulty Elitism Danger Experimental Healthfulness -- Different offerings on this X-Y axis treat different people differently. They don’t compete; they’re simply on the same board. When you look at the list of available attributes, it’s tempting to pick the ones that most people care about. After all, it’s hard work to claim an edge, and to pick one that few people care about seems foolish. Better, we think, to pick the popular one. If you do, you’ll certainly be choosing a crowded quadrant. It’s very difficult to grow in a quadrant that’s crowded. The alternative is to build your own quadrant. To find two axes that have been overlooked. That puts you in a position where you are the clear and obvious choice. Outsource the tasks and find the guts to do emotional labor instead. The most frustrated marketers I know are the ones who take it as a given that because they are in industry x, they have no freedom. They do precisely what the others do. Boosting our posts, counting our followers, and creating ever more content in the hope of being noticed. There are so many other ways to make an impact and earn trust. A decade ago, it took a dedicated team of publishers, print brokers, and sales reps to get a book to be available nationwide. Now a Kindle book can be published by one smart person with a digital file. We made the “doing” easier, which is precisely why we need to outsource that part of our job and focus all our energy onto the hard work of making change happen. We still talk about being very good at our craft as if it’s some sort of bizarre exception. Plenty of people are good at what you do. Quality is required but no longer sufficient. Your customers know more than you do about your competitors. And so your commodity work is not enough. If we merely try to fill a hole in the market, we’re doomed: driven by scarcity, focused on market share. The alternative is to find and build and earn your story. Once you claim a story, you’re on the hook to deliver. Authenticity in the marketplace is a myth. What people want is to be understood and to be served, not merely to witness whatever you feel like doing in a given moment. You are not expected (or welcome) to bring us every one of your insecurities, innermost fears, and urgent demands. You’re here to serve. Emotional labor is the work of doing what we don’t feel like doing. It’s about showing up with a smile when we’re wincing inside. If you need to be authentic to do your best work, you’re not a professional. Exert emotional labor in search of empathy - the empathy to imagine what someone else would want, what they might believe, what story would resonate with them. We don’t do this work because we feel like it in the moment. We do this work, this draining emotional labor, because we’re professionals, and because we want to make change happen. Emotional labor is the work we do to provide service. What do people want? If you ask them, you probably won’t find what you’re looking for. It’s our job to watch people, figure out what they dream of, and then create a transaction that can deliver that feeling. People are intimately aware of their wants (which they think of as needs) but they are absolutely terrible at inventing new ways to address those wants. They often prefer to use a familiar solution to satisfy their wants, even if it’s not working very well. The seven billion people on this planet share a basket of desires: Adventure Affection Avoiding new things Belonging Community Control Creativity Delight Freedom of expression Freedom of movement Friendship Good looks Health Learning new things Luxury Nostalgia Obedience Participation Peace of mind Physical activity Power Reassurance Reliability Respect Revenge Romance Safety Security Sex Strength Sympathy Tension Artists don’t need many colors to paint an original masterpiece. Just address these desires. The people who are happy with boring are actively avoiding you. The only people we can serve are curious, dissatisfied, or bored. Make an assertion. Outline a promise. Choose your extremes, find the people you seek to change, and show up with your offer. Call it a test if you want to. But it’s real life. The real life of engaging with what’s possible, and of working with people who want to make a change. Always be seeking, connecting, solving, asserting, believing, seeing, and yes, testing. Sometimes you’ll be right. But most of the time, you’ll be wrong. That’s okay. What could make a book worth two hundred dollars? Or a hotel room worth fifteen hundred dollars? “More of the same” is the wrong answer. We don’t pay ten times extra for more words. Instead, it’s a different extreme. People bend themselves into a pretzel trying to please the anonymous masses before they have fifty or one hundred people who would miss them if they were gone. Instead of asking for feedback, seek advice, like this: “I made something that I like, that I thought you’d like. How’d I do? What advice do you have for how I could make it fit your worldview more closely?” It’s worth the effort to insulate ourselves from a raw emotional onslaught and to tease out substantial useful direction instead. At the heart of the exclusive organization is a simple truth: every member is “people like us.” Sign up for that and you gain status. Walk away and you lose it. To change a culture, begin with an exclusive cohort. Your work is a tree. The roots live in the soil of dreams and desires of those you seek to serve. If your work is simply a commodity, a quick response to an obvious demand, then your roots don’t run deep. It’s unlikely that your tree will grow, or even if it does, it’s unlikely to be seen as important, useful, or dominant. It will be crowded out by all the similar trees. As your tree grows, it creates a beacon for the community. The early adopters among the people you seek to serve can engage with the tree, climb it, use it for shade, and, eventually, eat the fruits. And they attract the others. If you have planned well, the tree will quickly grow taller, because the sun isn’t being blocked - there are few other trees in the same area. As the tree grows, it not only attracts other people, but its height (as the dominant choice in the neighborhood) blocks out the futile efforts of other, similar trees. The market likes a winner. It’s a mistake to show up with an acorn and expect a crowd. A pattern interrupt requires some sort of jolt. Tension is created, and energy is diverted to consider this new input. Is it something worth considering? Most of the time, for most of those you seek to reach, the answer is no because the patterns are established, time is precious, and risk is something to be feared. If you want someone who has never hired a gardener to hire you to be their gardener, you’re asking for a pattern interrupt. The pattern requires undoing before you can earn forward motion. When life interferes, new patterns are established. This is why it’s so profitable to market to new dads, engaged women, and people who have recently moved. They don’t have a pattern to match, so it’s all an interrupt. The best time to market a new app is when the platform is brand new. When you market to someone who doesn’t have a pattern yet, you don’t have to persuade them that their old choices were mistakes. Why do some people hesitate to ask a question during a class, but will happily answer the professor if they’re called on? The teacher applies focused social tension in the form of publicly calling on a student. The tension was sufficient to overcome his or her inertia. We create tension when we ask someone. We’re using one force (social engagement) to overcome another force (the status quo). Launch a new project and, in addition to serving your audience, you’ll be breaking something. The very existence of an alternative causes something else to no longer be true. When you launch an extreme (the most efficient, the least expensive, the most convenient), then whatever you’ve exceeded is no longer the extreme that its fans sought out. The tension people face any time they’re about to cross a threshold: The tension of this might work versus this might not work. The tension of, “If I learn this, will I like who I become?” All effective education creates tension, because just before you learn something, you’re aware you don’t know it (yet). When they started building fancy casinos in Las Vegas, it created tension for countless travelers. Visitors who just a year earlier were happy in Reno or in downtown Las Vegas now felt like second-class citizens. They asked, “Am I the sort of person who goes to a casino this run-down?” The very existence of a fancier alternative degraded their experience at their former favorite. The desire to change our status, or to protect it, drives almost everything we do. It’s a mistake to believe that everyone wants to make their status higher. In fact, few people do. It’s also a mistake to believe that no one wants to make their status lower. If you’ve been conditioned to see yourself in a certain status role, you might fight to maintain and even lower your status. Status is always relative. It’s about perception of status relative to others in the group. Status is in the eyes of the beholder. Status has inertia. We’re more likely to work to maintain our status (high or low) than we are to try to change it. Status is learned. Our beliefs about status start early. And yet the cohort we are with can influence our perception of our status in very little time. Shame is the status killer. If we accept the shame someone sends our way, it undermines our entire narrative about relative status. Focus on those with low status instead of yourself. One can enjoy as much status by letting someone into the flow of traffic as they can from cutting him off. The status that comes from the community. The status of respect in return for contribution, for caring, for seeing and being in sync with others. Especially others with no ability to repay you. This type of status is not “I’m better.” It’s “I’m connected. I’m family.” For a local craftsperson, status means hunkering down in a single neighborhood until a reputation is assured. Dominion is a vertical experience, above or below. Affiliation is a horizontal one: Who’s standing next to me? When we pick up a book that feels self-published, we treat it differently than the book that reminds us of a classic we read in high school. The internet is littered with websites, emails, and videos made by amateurs. Amateurs who made something that they liked. Which is fine. But what a professional does for you is design something that other people will like. They create a look and feel that reminds people of their sort of magic. What a good designer offers you: The chance to fit in. You might choose to hire a great designer instead. Someone who can break the expectation and talk differently, but not so differently that you don’t resonate with those you seek to connect with. What’s your brand? Hint: it’s not your logo. In a super-crowded world, a brand is a shorthand for the customer’s expectations. What promise do they think you’re making? Make a list of five logos you admire. Each one represents a brand you admire. Almost no one picks a swastika or the clever glyph of the bank who ripped them off. Logos are so wrapped up in the brand promise that we imbue them with all the powers of the brand, ignoring the pixels involved. It’s possible for a terrible logo to adorn a fabulous brand (like the complicated mermaid of Starbucks). Pick a logo, don’t spend a ton of money, and keep it for as long as you keep your first name. If someone is satisfied with what they have, you’re unlikely to have the time or the money to reach out to them directly and cause them to become dissatisfied. Begin with the neophiliacs, the folks with a problem that you can solve right now (novelty and tension and the endless search for better). Neophiliacs want to go first. They want hope and possibility and magic. They want the thrill of it working and the risk that it might not. They want the pleasure of showing their innovation to the rest. Treat different people differently. When you find someone who is eager to talk about what you do, give them something to talk about. Treat different people differently. When you find someone who is itching to become a generous leader, give them the resources to lead. You’ll serve many people. You’ll profit from a few. Seek out and delight the few. Treat different people differently. While everyone has a platform, not everyone is using it. We can list tactics. Strategy is the umbrella over your tactics. If you tell your competition your tactics, they’ll steal them and it will cost you. But if you tell them your strategy, it won’t matter. Direct marketing is action oriented. And it is measured. Brand marketing is culturally oriented. And it can’t be measured. If you run an ad on Facebook and count your clicks, and then measure how many of them convert, you’re doing direct marketing. If you’re buying direct marketing ads, measure everything. If you’re buying brand marketing ads, refuse to measure. Instead, be consistent and patient. Overinvest in the way your team interacts with customers. Every slice of every interaction ought to reflect the whole. Every time we see any of you, we ought to be able to make a smart guess about all of you. We remember the things that we see again and again. Marketers forget this because we get bored with our stuff, so we change it. SEO is the practice of ranking high in the search results for a generic term. The path isn’t to be found when someone types in a generic term. The path is to have someone care enough about you and what you create that they’ll type in your name. That they’ll be looking for you, not a generic alternative. Say bread ingredients cost $1.95. The baker who charges $2 a loaf has to sell twenty-one loaves for every loaf the luxury baker sells at $3. Twenty-one times as many is the difference between a few customers an hour or a line out the door. “But our customers would prefer to pay the lower price.”? Perhaps. But how do they value the sparkling clean shop, with plenty of well-paid and helpful staff, a new sign in the window, and a local baseball team with new jerseys with your logo on them? How do they value the handsome shopping bag that comes with every loaf, not to mention the free samples of the little butter cookies you call punitions? How does it make them feel to tell their friends that they’re eating the same bread that’s served at the fancy restaurant down the street? Better to apologize for the price once than to have to excuse a hundred small slights again and again. Price is a signal. “Cheap” is another way to say “scared”. When you’re the cheapest, you’re not promising change. You’re promising the same, but cheaper. Two offerings, married to each other: 1. Free ideas that spread. 2. Expensive expressions of those ideas that are worth paying for. Real permission works like this: If you stop showing up, people are concerned. They ask where you went. Facebook and other social platforms seem like a shortcut, because they make it apparently easy to reach new people. But the tradeoff is that you’re a sharecropper. It’s not your land. You don’t have permission to contact people; they do. You don’t own an asset; they do. Every author of ideas needs to own a permission asset, the privilege of contacting people without a middleman. Media stunts come from a place of selfishness. The best reason someone talks about you is because they’re actually talking about themselves: “Look at how good my taste is.” Or perhaps, “Look at how good I am at spotting important ideas.” The best way to earn trust is through action. We remember what you did long after we forget what you said. Marketers spend a lot of time talking, and on working on what we’re going to say. We need to spend far more time doing. Becoming an outlier isn’t a strategy. It’s a wish. To satisfy the early adopters, you may just need to annoy the masses. The middle of the curve isn’t eagerly adopting. They’re barely adapting. The very thing your innovation did (break things) is the one thing that the mass market doesn’t want to happen. Two simple questions: What will I tell my friends? Why will I tell them? A simple three-step narrative for action: the story of self, the story of us, and the story of now. 1. Story of self gives you standing, a platform from which to speak. Story of transition from who you used to be to who you became. Story of self is your chance to explain that you are people like us. That you did things like this. That your actions led to a change, one we can hear and see and understand. 2. Story of us is the kernel of a tribe. Why are we alike? Why should we care? How we will benefit when we’re part of people like us. 3. Story of now is the critical pivot. It enlists the tribe on your journey. It’s the peer opportunity/peer pressure of the tribe that will provide the tension for all of us to move forward, together. If we leave the others behind, it won’t work. The urgency of now requires that we do it together, without delay, without remorse, without giving in to our fear.","A must-read for every entrepreneur. A holistic, generous, human, emotional, long-term, story-driven approach to your business. The world would be a much better place if businesses were led this way. You'll have a competitive advantage if you do this, since so few do."
Life 3.0,Max Tegmark,1101970316,9,"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, not in the laws of physics, so before our Universe awoke, there was no beauty. We transformed our Universe from a mindless zombie with no self-awareness into a living ecosystem harboring self-reflection, beauty and hope - and the pursuit of goals, meaning and purpose. Had our Universe never awoken, then, as far as I’m it would have been completely pointless - merely a gigantic waste of space. Let’s define life very broadly, simply as a process that can retain its complexity and replicate. What’s replicated isn’t matter (made of atoms) but information (made of bits) specifying how the atoms are arranged. Think of life as a self-replicating information-processing system whose information (software) determines both its behavior and the blueprints for its hardware. If bacteria are Life 1.0 and humans are Life 2.0, then you might classify mice as 1.1: they can learn many things, but not enough to develop language or invent the internet. Because they lack language, what they learn gets largely lost when they die, not passed on to the next generation. Similarly, you might argue that today’s humans should count as Life 2.1: we can perform minor hardware upgrades such as implanting artificial teeth, knees and pacemakers, but nothing as dramatic as getting ten times taller or acquiring a thousand times bigger brain. We can divide the development of life into three stages, distinguished by life’s ability to design itself: Life 1.0 (biological stage): evolves its hardware and software Life 2.0 (cultural stage): evolves its hardware, designs much of its software Life 3.0 (technological stage): designs its hardware and software Terminology: Life = Process that can retain its complexity and replicate Life 1.0 = Life that evolves its hardware and software (biological stage) Life 2.0 = Life that evolves its hardware but designs much of its software (cultural stage) Life 3.0 = Life that designs its hardware and software (technological stage) Intelligence = Ability to accomplish complex goals Artificial Intelligence (AI) = Non-biological intelligence Narrow intelligence = Ability to accomplish a narrow set of goals, e.g., play chess or drive a car General intelligence = Ability to accomplish virtually any goal, including learning Universal intelligence = Ability to acquire general intelligence given access to data and resources [Human-level] Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) = Ability to accomplish any cognitive task at least as well as humans Human-level AI = AGI Strong AI = AGI Superintelligence = General intelligence far beyond human level Civilization = Interacting group of intelligent life forms Consciousness = Subjective experience Qualia = Individual instances of subjective experience Ethics = Principles that govern how we should behave Teleology = Explanation of things in terms of their goals or purposes rather than their causes Goal-oriented behavior = Behavior more easily explained via its effect than via its cause Having a goal = Exhibiting goal-oriented behavior Having purpose = Serving goals of one’s own or of another entity Friendly AI = Superintelligence whose goals are aligned with ours Cyborg = Human-machine hybrid Intelligence explosion = Recursive self-improvement rapidly leading to superintelligence Singularity = Intelligence explosion Universe = The region of space from which light has had time to reach us during the 13.8 billion years since our Big Bang (Many misunderstandings about AI are caused by people using the words above to mean different things.) You’re probably not an ant hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. The beneficial-AI movement wants to avoid placing humanity in the position of those ants. Universal intelligence: given enough time and resources, it can make itself able to accomplish any goal as well as any other intelligent entity. Intelligence is ultimately all about information and computation, not about flesh, blood or carbon atoms. Substrate independence: there are many beautiful examples of it in physics. Waves, for instance: they have properties such as speed, wavelength and frequency, and physicists can study the equations they obey without even needing to know what particular substance they’re waves in. When you hear something, you’re detecting sound waves caused by molecules bouncing around in the air, and we can calculate all sorts of interesting things about these waves - how their intensity fades as the square of the distance, such as how they bend when they pass through open doors and how they bounce off of walls and cause echoes - without knowing what air is made of. We can ignore all details about oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc., because the only property of the wave’s substrate that matters and enters into the famous wave equation is a single number that we can measure: the wave speed. This wave equation was first discovered and put to great use long before physicists had even established that atoms and molecules existed. A wave can travel across a lake, even though none of its water molecules do - they mostly bob up and down, like fans doing “the wave” in a sports stadium. You can’t have computation without matter, but any matter will do as long as it can be arranged into NAND gates, connected neurons or some other building block enabling universal computation. It’s often only the substrate-independent aspect that we’re interested in: a surfer usually cares more about the position and height of a wave than about its detailed molecular composition. Nobody knows for sure what the next blockbuster computational substrate will be, but we do know that we’re nowhere near the limits imposed by the laws of physics. That limit is a whopping 33 orders of magnitude (1033 times) beyond today’s state of the art. Even if we keep doubling the power of our computers every couple of years, it will take over two centuries until we reach that final frontier. An artificial neural network represents the state of each neuron by a single number and the strength of each synapse by a single number. In this model, each neuron updates its state at regular time steps by simply averaging together the inputs from all connected neurons, weighting them by the synaptic strengths, optionally adding a constant, and then applying what’s called an activation function to the result to compute its next state. The easiest way to use a neural network as a function is to make it feedforward, with information flowing only in one direction, plugging the input to the function into a layer of neurons at the top and extracting the output from a layer of neurons at the bottom. If we don’t change direction soon, we’ll end up where we’re headed. Basic reinforcement learning is a classic machine learning technique inspired by behaviorist psychology, where getting a positive reward increases your tendency to do something again and vice versa. DeepMind combined this idea with deep learning: they trained a deep neural net to predict how many points would on average be gained by pressing each of the allowed keys on the keyboard, and then the AI selected whatever key the neural net rated as most promising. That's deep reinforcement learning. If you’re a robot, life itself can be viewed as a game. All that’s needed is a system that gives it points whenever it makes progress. AlphaGo displayed both intuition and creativity. Combining the intuition of deep learning with the logic of “good old-fashioned AI” can produce second-to-none strategy. AlphaGo was to marry the intuitive power of deep learning with the logical power of “good old-fashioned AI”. They used a massive database of Go positions from both human play and games where AlphaGo had played a clone of itself, and trained a deep neural network to predict from each position the probability that white would ultimately win. They also trained a separate network to predict likely next moves. They then combined these networks with a “good old-fashioned AI” method that cleverly searched through a pruned list of likely future-move sequences to identify the next move that would lead to the strongest position down the road. The Winograd Schema Challenge asks what “they” refers to here: 1. “The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence.” 2. “The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence.” It’s getting progressively harder to argue that AI completely lacks goals, breadth, intuition, creativity or language. Verification asks “Did I build the system right?” Validation asks “Did I build the right system?” Does the system rely on assumptions that might not always be valid? If so, how can it be improved to better handle uncertainty? Industrial accidents have decreased rather than increased as technology has improved, dropping from about 14,000 deaths in 1970 to 4,821 in 2014. What if a phishing email appears to come from your credit card company and is followed up by a phone call from a friendly human voice that you can’t tell is AI-generated? Once AI becomes able to generate fully realistic fake videos of you committing crimes, will you vote for a system where the government tracks everyone’s whereabouts at all times and can provide you with an ironclad alibi if needed? If a self-driving car causes an accident, who should be liable? The car itself! Self-driving cars might be allowed (and required) to hold car insurance. Models with a sterling safety record will qualify for premiums that are very low, probably lower than what’s available to human drivers, while poorly designed models from sloppy manufacturers will only qualify for insurance policies that make them prohibitively expensive to own. If machines such as cars are allowed to hold insurance policies, should they also be able to own money and property? If so, there’s nothing legally stopping smart computers from making money. If AI systems eventually get better than humans at investing (which they already are in some domains), this could lead to a situation where most of our economy is owned and controlled by machines. Most of our economy is already owned by another form of non-human entity: corporations. In a dogfight between a fully autonomous drone that can respond instantly and a drone reacting more sluggishly because it’s remote-controlled by a human halfway around the world, which one do you think would win? Those who stand to gain most from an arms race aren’t superpowers but small rogue states and non-state actors such as terrorists, who gain access to the weapons via the black market once they’ve been developed. Once mass-produced, small AI-powered killer drones are likely to cost little more than a smartphone. Whether it’s a terrorist wanting to assassinate a politician or a jilted lover seeking revenge on his ex-girlfriend, all they need to do is upload their target’s photo and address into the killer drone: it can then fly to the destination, identify and eliminate the person, and self-destruct to ensure that nobody knows who was responsible. Would it be easier to enforce a requirement that enemy autonomous weapons be 100% ethical than to enforce that they aren’t produced in the first place? Digital Athens: The reason that the Athenian citizens of antiquity had lives of leisure where they could enjoy democracy, art and games was mainly that they had slaves to do much of the work. But why not replace the slaves with AI-powered robots? Inequality? The main cause is something else: technology. Digital technology drives inequality. Career Advice: choose professions that seem unlikely to get automated in the near future. Example: Teacher, nurse, doctor, dentist, scientist, entrepreneur, programmer, engineer, lawyer, social worker, clergy member, artist, hairdresser or massage therapist. Does it require interacting with people and using social intelligence? Does it involve creativity and coming up with clever solutions? Does it require working in an unpredictable environment? Don’t be the radiologist who analyzes the medical images and gets replaced by IBM’s Watson, but the doctor who orders the radiology analysis, discusses the results with the patient, and decides on the treatment plan. During the Industrial Revolution, we started figuring out how to replace our muscles with machines, and people shifted into better-paying jobs where they used their minds more. Now we’re gradually figuring out how to replace our minds by machines. If we ultimately succeed in this, then what jobs are left for us? The vast majority of today’s occupations are ones that already existed a century ago, and when we sort them by the number of jobs they provide, we have to go all the way down to twenty-first place in the list until we encounter a new occupation: software developers, who make up less than 1% of the U.S. job market. The main trend on the job market isn’t that we’re moving into entirely new professions. Rather, we’re crowding into those pieces of terrain that haven’t yet been submerged by the rising tide of technology! Imagine two horses seeing an automobile in the year 1900. “I’m sure there’ll be new new jobs for horses that we haven’t yet imagined. That’s what’s always happened before, like with the invention of the wheel and the plow.” People decided to take care of horses. Can we similarly take care of our fellow humans in need? Game theory elegantly explains that entities have an incentive to cooperate where cooperation is a so-called Nash equilibrium: a situation where any party would be worse off if they altered their strategy. To prevent cheaters from ruining the successful collaboration of a large group, it may be in everyone’s interest to relinquish some power to a higher level in the hierarchy that can punish cheaters. For example, people may collectively benefit from granting a government power to enforce laws, and cells in your body may collectively benefit from giving a police force (immune system) the power to kill any cell that acts too uncooperatively. For a hierarchy to remain stable, its Nash equilibrium needs to hold also between entities at different levels: for example, if a government doesn’t provide enough benefit to its citizens for obeying it, they may change their strategy and overthrow it. How is technology changing the hierarchical nature of our world? History reveals an overall trend toward ever more coordination over ever-larger distances. Although our present world remains stuck in a multipolar Nash equilibrium, with competing nations and multinational corporations at the top level, technology is now advanced enough that a unipolar world would probably also be a stable Nash equilibrium. Most AI researchers and neuroscientists guess that the quickest route to superintelligence is to bypass brain emulation and engineer it in some other way. After all, why should our simplest path to a new technology be the one that evolution came up with. The aviation industry didn’t start with mechanical birds. A fast AI takeoff makes world takeover easier, while a slow one makes an outcome with many competing players more likely. It’s a mistake to passively ask “what will happen,” as if it were somehow predestined! Instead ask: “What should happen? What future do we want?” If we don’t know what we want, we’re unlikely to get it. Do you want to maximize positive experiences, minimize suffering, or leave this to sort itself out? To the vastly more intelligent entities that would exist at that time, an uploaded human may seem about as interesting as a simulated mouse or snail would seem to us. Although we currently have the technical capability to reanimate old spreadsheet programs from the 1980s in a DOS emulator, most of us don’t find this interesting enough to actually do it. Valuing diversity, and recognizing that different people have different preferences, the AI has divided Earth into different sectors for people to choose between, to enjoy the company of kindred spirits. Here are some examples: • Knowledge sector: Here the AI provides optimized education, including immersive virtual-reality experiences, enabling you to learn all you’re capable of about any topics of your choice. Optionally, you can choose not to be told certain beautiful insights, but to be led close and then have the joy of rediscovering them for yourself. • Art sector: Here opportunities abound to enjoy, create and share music, art, literature and other forms of creative expression. • Hedonistic sector: Locals refer to it as the party sector, and it’s second to none for those yearning for delectable cuisine, passion, intimacy or just wild fun. • Pious sector: There are many of these, corresponding to different religions, whose rules are strictly enforced. • Wildlife sector: Whether you’re looking for beautiful beaches, lovely lakes, magnificent mountains or fantastic fjords, here they are. • Traditional sector: Here you can grow your own food and live off the land as in yesteryear - but without worrying about famine or disease. • Gaming sector: If you like computer games, the AI has created truly mind-blowing options for you. • Virtual sector: If you want a vacation from your physical body, the AI will keep it hydrated, fed, exercised and clean while you explore virtual words through neural implants. • Prison sector: If you break rules, you’ll end up here for retraining unless you get the instant death penalty. The AI enforces two tiers of rules: universal and local. Universal rules apply in all sectors, for example a ban on harming other people. Individual sectors have additional local rules on top of this, encoding certain moral values. The sector system therefore helps deal with values that don’t mesh. Talk of a robot-rights movement is met with chuckles. Why? One common pro-slavery argument is that slaves don’t deserve human rights because they or their race/species/kind are somehow inferior. For enslaved animals and machines, this alleged inferiority is often claimed to be due to a lack of soul or consciousness. Consciousness is by far the most remarkable trait. It’s how our Universe gets meaning. Galaxies are beautiful only because we see and subjectively experience them. If in the distant future our cosmos has been settled by high-tech zombie AIs, then it doesn’t matter how fancy their intergalactic architecture is: it won’t be beautiful or meaningful, because there’s nobody and nothing to experience it - it’s all just a huge and meaningless waste of space. There are computer tournaments in so-called losing chess. A human-extinction scenario that some people may feel better about: viewing the AI as our descendants. Parents with a child smarter than them, who learns from them and accomplishes what they could only dream of, are likely happy and proud even if they know they can’t live to see it all. In this spirit, AIs replace humans but give us a graceful exit that makes us view them as our worthy descendants. Humans are gradually phased out via a global one-child policy, but are treated so exquisitely well until the end that they feel they’re in the most fortunate generation ever. As long as the AIs eliminate poverty and give all humans the opportunity to live full and inspiring lives. The only viable path to broad relinquishment of technology is to enforce it through a global totalitarian state. If some but not all relinquish a transformative technology, then the nations or groups that defect will gradually gain enough wealth and power to take over. We’ve dramatically underestimated life’s future potential. We're not limited to century-long life spans marred by disease. Life has the potential to flourish for billions of years, throughout the cosmos. These ultimate limits are set not by our understanding, but by the laws of physics. This, ironically, makes it in some ways easier to analyze the long-term future of life than the short-term future. Unambitious civilizations simply become cosmically irrelevant. Almost all life that exists will be ambitious life. A blue whale is rearranged krill. There are two mathematically equivalent ways of describing each physical law: either as the past causing the future, or as nature optimizing something. The second way is more elegant and profound. Goal-oriented behavior was hardwired in the very laws of physics. To rescue a swimmer as fast as possible, a lifeguard won’t go in a straight line, but a bit further along the beach where she can go faster than in the water. (Nature does this too.) The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy tends to increase until it reaches its maximum possible value. When you pour cold milk into hot coffee, for example, your beverage appears to march irreversibly toward its own personal heat death goal, and before long, it’s all just a uniform lukewarm mixture. If a living organism dies, its entropy also starts to rise, and before long, the arrangement of its particles tends to get much less organized. Gravity behaves differently from all other forces and strives to make our Universe not more uniform and boring but more clumpy and interesting. Dissipation-driven adaptation: Random groups of particles strive to organize themselves so as to extract energy from their environment as efficiently as possible. Molecules exposed to sunlight would over time tend to arrange themselves to get better and better at absorbing sunlight. In other words, nature appears to have a built-in goal of producing self-organizing systems that are increasingly complex and lifelike. The second law of thermodynamics has a life loophole: although the total entropy must increase, it’s allowed to decrease in some places as long as it increases even more elsewhere. So life maintains or increases its complexity by making its environment messier. There are many known examples of such emergent self-replication. For example: Vortices in turbulent fluids can make copies of themselves, and clusters of microspheres can coax nearby spheres into forming identical clusters. At some point, a particular arrangement of particles got so good at copying itself that it could do so almost indefinitely by extracting energy and raw materials from its environment. We call such a particle arrangement life. A living organism is an agent of bounded rationality that doesn’t pursue a single goal, but instead follows rules of thumb for what to pursue and avoid. Our human minds perceive these evolved rules of thumb as feelings, which guide our decision making toward the ultimate goal of replication. Feelings of hunger and thirst protect us from starvation and dehydration, feelings of pain protect us from damaging our bodies, feelings of lust make us procreate, feelings of love and compassion make us help other carriers of our genes and those who help them and so on. Guided by these feelings, our brains can quickly and efficiently decide what to do without having to subject every choice to a tedious analysis of its ultimate implications for how many descendants we’ll produce. The ultimate authority is now our feelings, not our genes. Human behavior strictly speaking doesn’t have a single well-defined goal at all. If you’d been observing Earth’s atoms since our planet formed, you’d have noticed three stages of goal-oriented behavior: 1. All matter seemed focused on dissipation (entropy increase). 2. Some of the matter came alive and instead focused on replication and subgoals of that. 3. A rapidly growing fraction of matter was rearranged by living organisms to help accomplish their goals. The real risk with Artificial General Intelligence isn’t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble. Three tough subproblems: 1. Making AI learn our goals 2. Making AI adopt our goals 3. Making AI retain our goals Midas asked that everything he touched turn to gold, but was disappointed when this prevented him from eating and even more so when he inadvertently turned his daughter to gold. In the stories where a genie grants three wishes, there are many variants for the first two wishes, but the third wish is almost always the same: “Please undo the first two wishes, because that’s not what I really wanted.” To figure out what people really want, you can’t merely go by what they say. You also need a detailed model of the world, including the many shared preferences that we tend to leave unstated because we consider them obvious. Once we have such a world model, we can often figure out what people want even if they don’t tell us, simply by observing their goal-oriented behavior. Children of hypocrites learn more from what they see their parents do than from what they hear them say. We are currently trying hard to enable machines to infer goals from behavior, and this will be useful also long before any superintelligence comes on the scene. For example, a retired man may appreciate it if his eldercare robot can figure out what he values simply by observing him, so that he’s spared the hassle of having to explain everything with words or computer programming. One challenge involves finding a good way to encode arbitrary systems of goals and ethical principles into a computer. Another challenge is making machines that can figure out which particular system best matches the behavior they observe. Inverse reinforcement learning is that we make decisions all the time, and that every decision we make reveals something about our goals. By observing lots of people in lots of situations (either for real or in movies and books), the AI can eventually build an accurate model of all our preferences. The time window during which you can load your goals into an AI may be quite short: the brief period between when it’s too dumb to get you and too smart to let you. A superintelligent AI will resist being shut down if you give it any goal that it needs to remain operational to accomplish - and this covers almost all goals! If you give a superintelligence the sole goal of minimizing harm to humanity, for example, it will defend itself against shutdown attempts because it knows we’ll harm one another much more in its absence through future wars and other follies. The propensity to change goals in response to new experiences and insights increases rather than decreases with intelligence. The ethical views of many thinkers can be distilled into four principles: • Utilitarianism: Positive conscious experiences should be maximized and suffering should be minimized. • Diversity: A diverse set of positive experiences is better than many repetitions of the same experience, even if the latter has been identified as the most positive experience possible. • Autonomy: Conscious entities/societies should have the freedom to pursue their own goals unless this conflicts with an overriding principle. • Legacy: Compatibility with scenarios that most humans today would view as happy, incompatibility with scenarios that essentially all humans today would view as terrible. Would we really want people from 1,500 years ago to have a lot of influence over how today’s world is run? If not, why should we try to impose our ethics on future beings that may be dramatically smarter than us? If some sophisticated future computer programs turn out to be conscious, should it be illegal to terminate them? If there are rules against terminating digital life forms, then need there also be restrictions on creating them to avoid a digital population explosion? A fast-forward replay of our 13.8-billion-year cosmic history: 1. Matter seemingly intent on maximizing its dissipation 2. Primitive life seemingly trying to maximize its replication 3. Humans pursuing not replication but goals related to pleasure, curiosity, compassion and other feelings that they’d evolved to help them replicate 4. Machines built to help humans pursue their human goals The only currently programmable goals that are guaranteed to remain truly well-defined as an AI gets progressively more intelligent are goals expressed in terms of physical quantities alone, such as particle arrangements, energy and entropy. However, humans are a historical accident, and aren’t the optimal solution to any well-defined physics problem. How should we strive to shape the future of our Universe? If we cede control to a superintelligence before answering these questions rigorously, the answer it comes up with is unlikely to involve us. This makes it timely to rekindle the classic debates of philosophy and ethics, and adds a new urgency to the conversation! Philosophy with a deadline. Many arguments generate more heat than light. (because the antagonists are talking past each other.) Galileo described nature as “a book written in the language of mathematics.” Scientists started taking Newton’s theory of gravity seriously because they got more out of it than they put into it. Simple equations could accurately predict the outcome of every gravity experiment ever conducted. Emergent phenomenon has properties above and beyond those of its particles. Wetness: A drop of water is wet, but an ice crystal and a cloud of steam aren’t, even though they’re made of identical water molecules. Why? Because the property of wetness depends only on the arrangement of the molecules, the phenomenon of wetness emerges only when there are many molecules, arranged in the pattern we call liquid. What particle arrangements are conscious? Consciousness is an emergent phenomenon. Consciousness is the way that information feels when it’s processed in certain ways. It must be substrate-independent; it’s only the structure of the information processing that matters, not the structure of the matter doing the information processing. Which particle arrangements are conscious and which aren’t? If we can answer that, then we can figure out which AI systems are conscious. It can also help emergency-room doctors determine which unresponsive patients are conscious. We may sometimes have “consciousness without access,” that is, subjective experience of things that are too complex to fit into our working memory for later use. For example, when you experience inattentional blindness by being too distracted to notice an object in plain sight, this doesn’t imply that you had no conscious visual experience of it, merely that it wasn’t stored in your working memory. Should it count as forgetfulness rather than blindness? When people ask about the meaning of life as if it were the job of our cosmos to give meaning to our existence, they’re getting it backward. It’s not our Universe giving meaning to conscious beings, but conscious beings giving meaning to our Universe. Contrast sapience (the ability to think intelligently) with sentience (the ability to subjectively experience qualia). Humans have built our identity on being Homo sapiens. I suggest that we rebrand ourselves as Homo sentiens. Science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. Mindful optimism is the expectation that good things will happen if you plan carefully and work hard for them. Develop positive visions for the future. Positive visions form the foundation of all collaboration. After all, why sacrifice something you have if you can’t imagine the even greater gain that this will provide? This means that we should be imagining positive futures not only for ourselves, but also for society and for humanity. Do you want to own your technology or do you want your technology to own you?","A deep, bold, and visionary dive into Artificial Intelligence and its many implications. One of the most interesting books I've ever read. If you haven't read much of AI yet, start with “Surviving AI” as an intro, then read this as a deep-dive. His perspective is amazingly thorough. Defining terminology was a great way to start. For example life is a “process that can retain its complexity and replicate”. Intelligence is the “ability to accomplish complex goals”. That keeps it broad enough to define future technology as alive and intelligent."
Atomic Habits,James Clear,0735211299,9,"The aggregation of marginal gains: searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. It's easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. But our small choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps. Choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. You get what you repeat. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks. If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. Fall in love with the process rather than the product. A systems-first mentality beats a goal-oriented mind-set. Runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. “Identity” derived from the Latin “essentitas”, which means being, and “identidem”, which means repeatedly. Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want? Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? A habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. When you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges. If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated. The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. How to Create a Good Habit: 1 (Cue): Make it obvious 2 (Craving): Make it attractive 3 (Response): Make it easy 4 (Reward): Make it satisfying How to Break a Bad Habit: 1 (Cue): Make it invisible 2 (Craving): Make it unattractive 3 (Response): Make it difficult 4 (Reward): Make it unsatisfying The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. The cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible. Begin the process of behavior change with awareness. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. Make a list of your daily habits. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way - even the bad ones - which is why you repeat them. Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits have net negative outcomes. Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. Create an implementation intention: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan. Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it with something you already want. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. To build a new habit, identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” Social skills: When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet. Finances: When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing. Healthy eating: When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first. Minimalism: When I buy a new item, I will give something away. People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and the cues in front of you. Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. Think about your environment as filled with relationships - not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. Train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. Habits can be easier to change in a new environment. It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. Want to think more creatively? Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise. One space, one use. Each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable. 90 percent of heroin users become re-addicted once they return home from rehab to their old neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. Practice self-restraint not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often fades away. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming is associated with higher levels of dopamine. Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. It is the anticipation of a reward - not the fulfillment of it - that gets us to take action. Daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. The brain allocates a lot of space to the regions responsible for craving and desire. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else - praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal. Whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find. We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful. Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have. When a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps. Every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be. What you really want is to feel different. Reframe your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.” Living below your current means increases your future means. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. Motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. To master a habit, start with repetition, not perfection. Habit formation: It doesn’t matter if it’s been thirty days or three hundred days. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. Addition by subtraction: look for every point of friction and eliminate it. Subtract wasted effort to achieve more with less effort. Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. Prime your environment so it’s ready for immediate use. Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments. Each one is like a fork in the road, and these choices stack up throughout the day. When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do. Master the habit of showing up. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. If you show up at the gym five days in a row - even if it’s just for two minutes - you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. Cut down on eating? Ask the waiter to split my meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. A woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting. The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future. What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. Add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. If your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage. Visual measures - like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles - provide clear evidence of your progress. They reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. The best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. People who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. Habit tracking keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on. One glance and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. If I miss one day, a simple rule: never miss twice. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it - even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity. The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can derail your habits. When a measure becomes the target, it ceases to be a good measure. Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Babies who turn toward noise are more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turn away are more likely to become introverts. Understand your nature to better your strategy. Genes tell you where the odds are in your favor. Work on tasks of just manageable difficulty. The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty : roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability. Successful weightlifting comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over. Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Peak performance = getting slightly better each day. Keep a “decision journal” to record the major decisions you make each week, why you made them, and what you expect the outcome to be. Review the choices at the end of each month or year to see where you were correct and where you went wrong. I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited. What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn? Revisit your core values and consider whether you have been living in accordance with them. What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future? Your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. The more sacred an idea is to us - that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity - the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. The veteran who is committed to doing things “his way.” The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. Avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. Keep your identity small. Happiness is simply the absence of desire. Happiness is when you have no urge to feel differently - when you no longer want to change your state. Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming. Suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it. Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems - if you do not desire to act on what you observe. Craving is about wanting to fix everything. We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional. The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. This is one reason why appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making. Resisting temptation: just ignore it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on promise. The second time around, your expectation is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your hope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the likely outcome.","I was doubtful, but everyone kept telling me it’s awesome, so I reluctantly read it. Holy crap! It’s GREAT! Feels like the definitive masterpiece on the subject of how to make good habits and break bad ones. Very focused on helping you take action. Very relatable and inspiring."
The Courage to Be Disliked,Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga,1501197274,9,"No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. Nothing is actually determined by those influences. We are not determined by our experiences, but by the meaning we give them. We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences - the so-called trauma - but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. If he thinks, “I can’t __ because I was abused by my parents”, it’s because it is his goal to think that way. His real goal is “not going out.” He is creating anxiety and fear as his reasons to stay inside. Why doesn’t he want to go out? So his parents will worry. So he can get all his parents’ attention. If he takes one step out of the house, he’ll become part of a faceless mass whom no one pays attention to. He’ll end up average, or less than average. And no one will take special care of him. You did not fly into a rage and then start shouting. You got angry so that you could shout. To fulfill your goal of shouting, you created the emotion of anger. Anger is a tool that can be taken out as needed. It can be put away the moment the phone rings, and pulled out again after one hangs up. Anger is a means to achieve a goal. Personal anger is nothing but a tool for making others submit to you. Anger is a form of communication, and that communication is possible without using anger. You are not controlled by emotion. When you fly into a rage and shout at another person, it is “you as a whole” who is choosing to shout. Emotions don't somehow exist independently. It is a lie to separate “I” from “emotion” and think, “It was the emotion that made me do it.” You are not controlled by the past. The Freudian etiology that is typified by the trauma argument is determinism, and it is the road to nihilism. Freudian etiology denies our free will and treats humans like machines. People are not driven by past causes, but move toward goals that they themselves set. The Greek word for “good” (agathon) does not have a moral meaning. It just means “beneficial.” Conversely, the word for “evil” (kakon) means “not beneficial.” No one desires evil: something “not beneficial.” Personality is something that you choose for yourself. External factors had a significant influence on that choice. But you chose this kind of self. (Adlerian psychology’s view is that it happens around the age of ten.) The lifestyle you have now is like driving your old, familiar car. It might rattle a bit, but you can take that into account and maneuver easily. But if you choose a new lifestyle, it will be hard to see ahead to the future, and life will be filled with anxiety. A more painful and unhappy life might lie ahead. It’s easier and more secure to stay broken the way you are. Being “the way I am” with all these shortcomings is, for you, a precious virtue. He dreams of becoming a novelist, but he never completes his work. He says his job keeps him too busy, and he can never find enough time. No! It’s actually that he wants to leave the possibility of “I can do it if I try” open. He doesn’t want to face the reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection. He wants to live inside the realm of possibilities. You say fear is stopping you from doing what you want. If I did cure your fear, and nothing in your situation changed at all, you’d probably say, ‘Give me back my fear!’ No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it has no bearing at all on how you live from now on. You are afraid of being negated by other people. You think that instead of getting entangled in such situations, it would be better if you just didn’t have relations with anyone. Your goal is to not get hurt. All problems are interpersonal relationship problems. To get rid of your problems, all you can do is live in the universe all alone. But you can’t do that. We are all suffering in interpersonal relationships. Loneliness is having other people around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them. To feel lonely, we need other people. Internal worry does not exist. Whatever the worry that may arise, the shadows of other people are always present. Subjectivity allows you to make your own choice - the choice to view facts as either an advantage or disadvantage. Value is based on a social context. Example: diamonds or dollars. The pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. “A is the situation, so B cannot be done” is an inferiority complex. Those who say that are implying that if only it were not for A, they’d be capable and have value. That “the real me” - which just happens to be obscured right now - is superior. Those who make themselves look bigger on borrowed power are living according to other people’s value systems. They are living other people’s lives. People use their misfortune to their advantage and try to control the other party with it, by declaring how unfortunate they are. A baby is the strongest person. Withdraw from places that are preoccupied with winning and losing. When you are trying to be yourself, competition will inevitably get in the way. The moment you are convinced “I am right” in an interpersonal relationship, you have already stepped into a power struggle. If you think you are right, regardless of what other people’s opinions might be, the matter should be closed then and there. However, many people try to make others submit to them. There are two objectives for ideal behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. Relationships in which people restrict each other eventually fall apart. The kind of relationship that feels somehow oppressive and strained when the two people are together cannot be called love, even if there is passion. When one can think, “Whenever I am with this person, I can behave very freely”, one can really feel love. You had the goal of taking a dislike to Mr. A beforehand and then started looking for the flaws to satisfy that goal so that you could avoid an interpersonal relationship. You are making up flaws in other people just so that you can avoid interpersonal relationships. Think with the perspective of “Whose task is this?” and continually separate your own tasks from other people’s tasks. Discard other people’s tasks. All interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on other people’s tasks, or having your own tasks intruded upon. To tell whose task it is, ask, “Who ultimately is going to receive the result brought about by the choice that is made?” What another person thinks of you is that person’s task, not yours. Just face your own tasks in your own life without lying. Do not intervene in other people’s tasks, or allow even a single person to intervene in your own tasks. Intervening in other people’s tasks is essentially egocentric. Forming good interpersonal relationships requires a certain degree of distance. Like you can't read a book if you push it up against your face, nor hold it too far away. No matter what sort of appeal the other person might make, you are the only one who decides what you should do. We must not seek reward, and we must not be tied to it. Children who have not been taught to confront challenges will try to avoid all challenges. It is easier to live in such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations, because you are entrusting your life to them. There is no reason of any sort that you should not live your life as you please. Desires and impulses to take you wherever they want. To live in such a way is only to be a slave to your desires and impulses. But we are not stones. We are beings who are capable of resisting inclination. We can stop our tumbling selves and climb uphill. Freedom is being disliked by other people. It is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own principles. Conducting yourself in such a way as to not be disliked by anyone is an extremely unfree way of living. I brought out the memory of being hit because I don’t want my relationship with my father to get better. Many people think that the interpersonal relationship cards are held by the other person. But they are holding all the cards. Society’s smallest unit is “you and I.” Praise implies the passing of judgment by a person of ability on a person of no ability. You praise to manipulate. It is because you are living in vertical relationships that you want to be praised. If you are building even one vertical relationship with someone, before you even notice what is happening, you will be treating all your interpersonal relations as vertical. The feeling of inferiority arises within vertical relationships. If you can build horizontal relationships that are “equal but not the same” for all people, there will no longer be any room for inferiority complexes to emerge. Why do you intervene - intruding on other people’s tasks? Because you see the other party as beneath you. Through intervention, you try to lead the other party in the desired direction. You have convinced yourself that you are right and that the other party is wrong. The child has to face his tasks. He is the one who makes the resolution. He can gain the confidence to take care of his own studies Neither praise nor rebuke. Being praised leads people to form the belief that they have no ability. Assistance, which is based on horizontal relationships, is referred to in Adlerian psychology as “encouragement.” Something that helps when one has lost the courage to face one’s tasks. (En-courage.) It is when you are able to feel “I am beneficial to the community” that you can have a true sense of your worth. Say you’ve got a score of 60 percent, but you tell yourself, “I just happened to get unlucky this time around, and the real me is 100 percent.” That is self-affirmation. By contrast, if you accept yourself as you are, as 60 percent, and think to yourself, “How should I go about getting closer to 100 percent?” - that is self-acceptance. The basis of interpersonal relations is founded not on trust but on confidence. Confidence is doing without any set conditions whatsoever when believing in others - without concerning oneself with such things as security. There are people who will continue to have confidence in you no matter how they are treated. Unconditional confidence is a means for making your interpersonal relationship with a person better and for building a horizontal relationship. If you do not have the desire to make your relationship with that person better, then sever it. Because severing is your task. People who have so much money that they could never use it all work so they are able to contribute to others, and also to confirm their sense of belonging, their feeling that “it’s okay to be here.” Generalizing statements: you see only a part of things but judge the whole. Happiness is the feeling of contribution. If you really have a feeling of contribution, you will no longer have any need for recognition from others. Pursuit of easy superiority: the ones who engage in problem behavior are trying to attract the attention of other people even as they continue to avoid any such healthy effort. They will probably succeed in becoming “special”. Parents and other adults are giving them attention through the act of rebuking. They make trouble for another person while trying at the same time to be “special”. Why is it necessary to be special? Be normal. You do not need to flaunt your superiority. If life were climbing a mountain in order to reach the top, then the greater part of life would end up being “en route.” Think of life as a series of dots. If you look through a magnifying glass at a solid line drawn with chalk, you will discover that what you thought was a line is actually a series of small dots. Seemingly linear existence is actually a series of dots; in other words, life is a series of moments called “now”. Life is not made up of lines. The life of the past that looks like a straight line appears that way to you only as a result of your making ceaseless resolutions to not change. A well-planned life is impossible. For example: Someone who has dreamed of being a violinist ever since childhood, and who, after years of strict training, has at long last become an active member in a celebrated orchestra. The violinist was always looking at pieces of music, and concentrating on each piece. Rather than living lives that are “en route,” they are always living here and now. Dancing itself is the goal, and no one is concerned with arriving somewhere by doing it. Naturally, it may happen that one arrives somewhere as a result of having danced. Since one is dancing, one does not stay in the same place. But there is no destination. If you’re under a bright spotlight, you won’t be able to see even the front row. If you are shining a bright spotlight on here and now, you cannot see the past or the future anymore. Likening your life to a story is entertaining. However, life is a series of dots, a series of moments. If you can grasp that, you will not need a story any longer. You set objectives for the distant future, and think of now as your preparatory period. You think, I really want to do this, and I’ll do it when the time comes. This is a way of living that postpones life. But a “here and now” in which one is studying now for the distant future, for example, is the real thing. Life is always simple, not something that one needs to get too serious about. Life is always complete. The greatest life-lie of all is to believe that one has been able to see the past and the future, To look back at the past in an etiological manner and say, “What could have caused such a thing to happen?” Hardship should be an opportunity to look ahead and think, What can I do from now on? Whatever meaning life has must be assigned to it by the individual. No matter what moments you are living, or if there are people who dislike you, as long as you do not lose sight of the guiding star of “I contribute to others,” you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like. If “I” change, the world will change. This means that the world can be changed only by me and no one else will change it for me.","Wow. A profound little philosophy book from Japan, communicating the psychology of Alfred Adler - a rival of Freud. Told as a conversation between an angry student and a patient teacher. A little book so good that I rushed home from other activities to keep reading it, and finished in a day. A surprisingly fresh perspective on how to live. (The “disliked” part is not the point, so don’t let the title distract you.)"
Thinking in Bets,Annie Duke,125115629,9,"A bet is a decision about an uncertain future. Two things determine how your life turns out: the quality of your decisions, and luck. Recognize the difference between the two. “Resulting” = when you equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome. A bad result does not mean a bad decision. Hindsight bias is the tendency, after an outcome is known, to see the outcome as having been inevitable. When a decision doesn’t work out, don't treat that result as if it were an inevitable consequence rather than a probabilistic one. Don't focus only on the poor outcome. “Real games”: Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other person going to think I mean to do. The decisions you make in your life - in business, saving and spending, health and lifestyle choices, raising your children, and relationships - are “real games”. Life is not like chess. Chess contains no hidden information and very little luck. Life is more like poker. You could make the smartest, most careful decision and still have it blow up in your face. You have to learn from the results of your decisions. Saying “I don’t know” is a necessary step toward enlightenment. It is a prelude to every great decision. A great decision is the result of a good process - not that it has a great outcome. Good decision-makers try to figure out how unsure they are, making their best guess at the chances that different outcomes will occur. Any prediction that is not 0% or 100% can’t be wrong solely because the most likely future doesn’t unfold. Long shots hit some of the time. When you think probabilistically, you are less likely to use adverse results alone as proof that you made a decision error, because you recognize the possibility that the decision might have been good but luck and/or incomplete information (and a sample size of one) intervened. Making better decisions is not about being wrong or right, but about calibrating among all the shades of grey. Every decision commits you to some course of action that, by definition, eliminates acting on other alternatives. Not placing a bet on something is, itself, a bet. Most bets are bets against yourself. You are betting against all the future versions of yourself that you are not choosing. Be a better belief calibrator, using experience and information to more objectively update your beliefs to more accurately represent the world. This is how you *think* you form beliefs: (1) You hear something. (2) You think about it and vet it, determining whether it is true or false. (3) Only after that, you form your belief. It turns out, though, that you *actually* form abstract beliefs this way: (1) You hear something (2) You believe it to be true (3) Only sometimes, later, if you have the time or the inclination, you think about it and vet it, determining whether it is, in fact, true or false. How you form beliefs was shaped by the evolutionary push toward efficiency rather than accuracy. Our ancestors could form new beliefs only through what they directly experienced. It’s reasonable to presume our senses aren’t lying. We didn’t develop a high degree of skepticism when our beliefs were about things we directly experienced, especially when our lives were at stake. The system we already had was: (1) experience it (2) believe it to be true (3) maybe, and rarely, question it later. Our older system is still in charge. “Wanna bet?” triggers you to engage in that third step that you only sometimes get to. You might think of yourself as updating your beliefs based on new information, but you do the opposite, altering your interpretation of that information to fit your beliefs. If you think of beliefs as only 100% right or 100% wrong, when confronting new information that might contradict your belief, you have only two options: (a) make the massive shift in your opinion of yourself from 100% right to 100% wrong (b) ignore or discredit the new information. It feels bad to be wrong, so you choose (b). Being smart can actually make bias worse. Blind-spot bias is worse the smarter you are. Being smart and aware of your capacity for irrationality alone doesn’t help you refrain from biased reasoning. People are better at recognizing biased reasoning in others but are blind to bias in themselves. You are wired to protect your beliefs even when your goal is to truthseek. Offering a wager brings the risk out in the open. The more you recognize that you are betting on your beliefs (with your happiness, attention, health, money, or time), the more you are likely to temper your statements, getting closer to the truth as you acknowledge the risk inherent in what you believe. Then you recognize that there is always a degree of uncertainty, that you are generally less sure than you thought you were, that what you believe is almost never 100% or 0% accurate. What if, in addition to expressing what you believe, you also rated your level of confidence about the accuracy of your belief on a scale of zero to ten? “I’m 60% confident that Citizen Kane won best picture” reflects that your knowledge is incomplete. You can express how confident you are by thinking about the number of plausible alternatives and declaring that range. The less you know about a topic or the more luck involved, the wider your range. Acknowledging uncertainty is the first step in measuring and narrowing it. It creates open-mindedness, and a more objective stance. When confronted with new evidence, it is a very different narrative to say, “I was 58% but now I’m 46%.” That doesn’t feel nearly as bad as “I thought I was right but now I’m wrong.” Declaring your uncertainty in your beliefs to others makes you more a credible communicator. By saying, “I’m 80%” and thereby communicating you aren’t sure, you open the door for others to tell you what they know. They realize they can contribute without having to confront you by saying or implying, “You’re wrong.” Expressing uncertainty signals to your listeners that this needs further vetting. Experience can be an effective teacher, but only some students listen to their teachers. Experience is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him. Identify when the outcomes of your decisions have something to teach you and what that lesson might be. Any decision is a bet on what will likely create the most favorable future for you. The future you have bet on unfolds as a series of outcomes. Why did something happen the way it did? Bet on how you figure out what you should learn from an outcome. If you determine your decisions drove the outcome, you can feed the data you get following those decisions back into belief formation and updating, creating a learning loop. The challenge is that any single outcome can happen for multiple reasons. Uncertainty drastically slows learning. The way you field outcomes is predictably patterned: you take credit for the good stuff and blame the bad stuff on luck so it won’t be your fault. The result is that you don’t learn from experience well. “Self-serving bias” is the term Blaming the bulk of your bad outcomes on luck means you miss opportunities to examine your decisions to see where you can do better. Taking credit for the good stuff means you will often reinforce decisions that shouldn’t be reinforced and miss opportunities to see where you could have done better. An experienced player will choose to play only about 20% of the hands they are dealt, forfeiting the other 80% of the hands before even getting past the first round of betting. That means about 80% of the time is spent just watching other people play. Even if a poker player doesn’t learn, all that learning from watching others is just as fraught with bias. If someone you view as a peer is winning, you feel like you’re losing by comparison. You benchmark yourself to them. To change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. Treating outcome fielding as a bet can accomplish the mindset shift necessary to reshape habit. We wouldn’t reflexively field bad outcomes as all luck or good ones as all skill. It’s easy to win a bet against someone who takes extreme positions. Thinking in bets triggers a more open-minded exploration of alternative hypotheses, of reasons supporting conclusions opposite to the routine of self-serving bias. We are more likely to explore the opposite side of an argument more often and more seriously - and that will move you closer to the truth. Agree to be open-minded to those who disagree eith you, give credit where it’s due, and take responsibility where it’s appropriate, Other people can spot your errors better than you can. Groups can improve the thinking of individual decision-makers when the individuals are accountable to a group whose interest is in accuracy. As long as there are three people in the group (two to disagree and one to referee*), the truthseeking group can be stable and productive. Encourage a diversity of perspectives. You win bets by relentlessly striving to calibrate your beliefs and predictions about the future to more accurately represent the world. Betting is a form of accountability to accuracy. I started moaning to him about my bad luck in losing a big hand. He said, “There’s not much purpose in a poker story if the point is about something you had no control over, like bad luck.” Where the challenge of a bet is always looming, evidence that might contradict a belief you hold is no longer viewed through as hurtful a frame. Rather, it is viewed as helpful because it can improve your chances of making a better bet. To view yourself in a more realistic way, you need different perspectives. Why might my belief not be true? What other evidence might be out there bearing on my belief? Are there similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true? What sources of information could I have missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief? What are the reasons someone else could have a different belief, what’s their support, and why might they be right instead of me? What other perspectives are there as to why things turned out the way they did? People are more willing to offer their opinion when the goal is to win a bet rather than get along with people in a room. Telling someone how a story ends encourages them to be resulters, to interpret the details to fit that outcome. Skepticism is about approaching the world by asking why things might not be true rather than why they are true. Thinking in bets embodies skepticism by encouraging you to examine what you do and don’t know and what your level of confidence is in your beliefs and predictions. It’s a recognition that everything you believe about the world is not true. You need to be particularly skeptical of information that agrees with you, because you know that you are biased to just accept confirming evidence. When you think about the past and the future, you engage deliberative mind, improving your ability to make a more rational decision. If regret occurred before a decision instead of after, the experience of regret might get you to change a choice likely to result in a bad outcome. Ask yourself a set of simple questions at the moment of the decision designed to get future-you and past-you involved. What are the consequences of each of my options in ten minutes? In ten months? In ten years? How would I feel today if I had made this decision ten minutes ago? Ten months ago? Ten years ago? Think about your happiness as a long-term stock holding, not focused on day-by-day movements. Strive for a long, sustaining upward trend in your happiness stock. Consider a broad range of possibilities for how the future might unfold to make your best guess at the probability of each of those futures occurring. You’re already making a prediction about the future every time you make a decision, so you’re better off if you make that explicit. Imagine yourself looking back from the destination and figure how you got there. Remembering the future is a better way to plan for it. Your decision-making improves when you can more vividly imagine the future, free of the distortions of the present. Negative visualization makes you more likely to achieve your goals. Imagine obstacles in the way of reaching your goals. Start a premortem by imagining why you failed to reach your goal. Then imagine why. All those reasons why you didn’t achieve your goal help you anticipate potential obstacles and improve your likelihood of succeeding. The likelihood of positive and negative futures must add up to 100%. When you see how much negative space there really is, you shrink down the positive space to a size that more accurately reflects reality and less reflects your naturally optimistic nature.","Amazing point: Would your belief in something stand up to the question, “Wanna bet?” If you had to gamble significant money on that belief, would you still feel 100% about it? Or maybe more honestly 60%? This creates healthy skepticism encouraging you to seek the best information instead of just defending your belief. Now objective accuracy wins instead of argument."
12 Rules for Life,Jordan Peterson,0345816021,9,"Without rules we quickly become slaves to our passions - and there’s nothing freeing about that. We are quick to aim low and worship qualities that are beneath us. The psychological mystery of self-deception: How can a person deceive himself and get away with it? Be wary of ideology, no matter who is peddling it or to what end. Ideologies are simple ideas, disguised as science or philosophy, that purport to explain the complexity of the world and offer remedies that will perfect it. Adopt as much responsibility as possible for individual life, society and the world. Tell the truth. Repair what is in disrepair. Break down and recreate what is old and outdated. This is how we can and must reduce the suffering that poisons the world. If a dominant lobster is badly defeated, its brain basically dissolves. Then it grows a new, subordinate’s brain - one more appropriate to its new, lowly position. Order is all the more “natural” the longer it has lasted. Because “nature” is “what selects,” the longer a feature has existed, the more time it has had to be selected - and to shape life. The dominance hierarchy has been around for some half a billion years. There is little more natural than culture. When we are defeated, our posture droops. We face the ground. We feel threatened, hurt, anxious and weak. The ancient part of your brain specialized for assessing dominance watches how you are treated by other people. On that evidence, it renders a determination of your value and assigns you a status. If you are judged by your peers as of little worth, the counter restricts serotonin availability. That makes you much more physically and psychologically reactive to circumstances. When operating at the bottom, the ancient brain counter assumes that even the smallest unexpected impediment might produce an uncontrollable chain of negative events, which will have to be handled alone, as useful friends are rare at the bottom. It will render you impulsive, so that, for example, you will jump at any short-term mating opportunities, or any possibilities of pleasure, no matter how sub-par. If you have a high status, mechanics assume that your niche is secure, productive and safe, and that you are well buttressed with social support. It thinks the chance that something will damage you is low and can be safely discounted. Change might be opportunity, instead of disaster. The serotonin flows plentifully. This renders you confident and calm, standing tall and straight, and much less on constant alert. Because your position is secure, the future is likely to be good for you. It’s worthwhile to think in the long term and plan for a better tomorrow. You don’t need to grasp impulsively at whatever crumbs come your way, because you can realistically expect good things to remain available. You can delay gratification, without forgoing it forever. You can afford to be a reliable and thoughtful citizen. Our anxiety systems are very practical. They assume that anything you run away from is dangerous. The proof of that is, of course, the fact you ran away. People who refuse to muster self-protective territorial responses are laid open to exploitation as much as those who genuinely can’t stand up for their own rights Bureaucracies have petty authoritarians within them, generating unnecessary rules and procedures simply to express and cement power. The willingness of the individual to stand up for him or herself protects everyone from the corruption of society. There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. Dare to be dangerous. Those who start to have will probably get more. These upwardly moving loops can occur in your own private, subjective space. See the gold the dragon hoards, instead of shrinking in terror from the dragon. The dividing line between order and chaos: That’s where we are simultaneously stable enough, exploring enough, transforming enough, repairing enough, and cooperating enough. To straddle that is to be balanced: to have one foot firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility, growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping and meaningful; when time passes and you’re so engrossed in what you’re doing you don’t notice - it is there and then that you are located precisely on the border between order and chaos. Place one foot in what you have mastered and understood, and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering. Chaos is the despair and horror you feel when you have been profoundly betrayed. Chaos is where we are when we don’t know where we are, and what we are doing when we don’t know what we are doing. It is all those things and situations we neither know nor understand. We all have a palpable sense of the chaos lurking under everything familiar. That’s why we understand the strange, surreal stories of Pinocchio, and Sleeping Beauty, and The Lion King, and The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, with their eternal landscapes of known and unknown, world and underworld. Paradise = pairidaeza in old Iranian or Avestan, which means walled or protected enclosure or garden. Old stories contain nothing superfluous. Anything accidental - anything that does not serve the plot - has long been forgotten in the telling. Heaven is something you must build. Immortality is something you must earn. Treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping. People are better at filling and properly administering prescription medication to their pets than to themselves. People often don’t really believe that they deserve the best care. Instead of narcissistically inflating their own importance, they don’t value themselves. It is not virtuous to be victimized by a bully, even if that bully is oneself. If I am someone’s friend, family member, or lover, then I am morally obliged to bargain as hard on my own behalf as they are on theirs. If I fail to do so, I will end up a slave, and the other person a tyrant. It is much better for any relationship when both partners are strong. There is little difference between standing up and speaking for yourself, and standing up and speaking for someone else. You do not simply belong to yourself. You are not simply your own possession to torture and mistreat. Your mistreatment of yourself can have catastrophic consequences for others. Enough people look beyond themselves that we have central heat and running water. It is only the constant attention of careful people that keeps it working so unbelievably well. Some people degenerate into the hell of resentment, but most refuse to do so. You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you. You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. When you move cities/countries, there are new possibilities. People, including you, can’t hem you in with their old notions. You get shaken out of your ruts. You can make new, better ruts, with people aiming at better things. Cities provide anonymity. People create their worlds with the tools they have directly at hand. Not everyone who is failing is a victim. Not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise. Distinguish between someone truly wanting and needing help, and someone who is merely exploiting a willing helper. The person who tries and fails, and is forgiven, and then tries again and fails, and is forgiven, is also too often the person who wants everyone to believe in the authenticity of all that trying. A boss moves a problematic person into the midst of a stellar team, hoping to improve him by example. What happens? The entire team degenerates. Place a delinquent teen among comparatively civilized peers. The delinquency spreads, not the stability. Down is a lot easier than up. Are you enabling a delusion? Is it possible that your contempt would be more helpful than your pity? If you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future, as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power. It is far more likely that a given individual has just decided to reject the path upward, because of its difficulty. Failure is easy to understand. In the same manner, fear, hatred, addiction, promiscuity, betrayal and deception. It’s easier not to shoulder a burden. It’s easier not to think, and not to do, and not to care. It’s easier to put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today. To fail, you merely have to cultivate a few bad habits. You just have to bide your time. Loyalty must be negotiated. Associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve. People who support your upward aim will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable. It’s easier for people to be good at something in small, rural communities. Local heroes have the opportunity to enjoy the serotonin-fuelled confidence of the victor. People born in small towns are statistically overrepresented among the eminent. People are not equal in ability or outcome, and never will be. A very small number of people produce very much of everything. If the cards are always stacked against you, perhaps the game you are playing is somehow rigged - perhaps by you. A cliché of nihilism: “In a million years, who’s going to know the difference?” The proper response to that statement is not, “Well, then, everything is meaningless.” It’s, “Any idiot can choose a frame of time within which nothing matters.” Standards of better or worse are not illusory or unnecessary. If you hadn’t decided that what you are doing right now was better than the alternatives, you wouldn’t be doing it. The idea of a value-free choice is a contradiction in terms. Value judgments are a precondition for action. Furthermore, every activity, once chosen, comes with its own internal standards of accomplishment. If something can be done at all, it can be done better or worse. Winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning. Before you can articulate your own standards of value, you must see yourself as a stranger - and then you must get to know yourself. Dare to be truthful. Dare to articulate yourself, and express what would really justify your life. If you allowed your dark and unspoken desires to manifest themselves - if you were even willing to consider them - you might discover that they were not so dark, given the light of day. You might discover, instead, that you were just afraid and, so, pretending to be moral. Are you so sure that your partner would be unhappy if more of you rose to the surface? Consult your resentment. It’s a revelatory emotion. Resentment always means one of two things. Either the resentful person is immature, in which case he or she should shut up, quit whining, and get on with it. Or is being taken advantage of (or allowing yourself to be taken advantage of). What are you inclined to lie about, assuming that the truth might be intolerable? What do you fake? We are always and simultaneously at point “a” (which is less desirable than it could be), moving towards point “b” (which we deem better). We live within a framework that defines the present as eternally lacking and the future as eternally better. If we did not see things this way, we would not act at all. Happiness is found in the journey uphill, and not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak. What you aim at determines what you see. To deal with the overwhelming complexity of the world, you ignore it, while you concentrate minutely on your private concerns. You’re blind to everything else. Perhaps what you really need is right in front of your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently aiming for. The world revealed whatever goodness it contains in precise proportion to your desire for the best. You cannot aim yourself at anything if you are completely undisciplined and untutored. You only see what you aim at. You can only find out what you actually believe by watching how you act. “What is it that is bothering me?” “Is that something I could fix?” “Would I actually be willing to fix it?” If you find that the answer is “no,” to any or all of the questions, then look elsewhere. Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day. It’s not for the best that all human corruption is uncritically laid at society’s feet. That conclusion merely displaces the problem, back in time. It explains nothing, and solves no problems. If society is corrupt, but not the individuals within it, then where did the corruption originate? How is it propagated? It’s a one-sided, deeply ideological theory. Each person’s private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous. We have learned to live together and organize our complex societies slowly and incrementally, over vast stretches of time, and we do not understand with sufficient exactitude why what we are doing works. Thus, altering our ways of social being carelessly in the name of some ideological shibboleth (diversity springs to mind) is likely to produce far more trouble than good, given the suffering that even small revolutions generally produce. The adolescent ethos of the 1960s, a decade whose excesses led to the inability to distinguish between the chaos of immaturity and responsible freedom. Children, like other human beings, are not only good, they cannot simply be left to their own devices, untouched by society, and bloom into perfection. Even dogs must be socialized if they are to become acceptable members of the pack - and children are much more complex than dogs. This means that they are much more likely to go complexly astray if they are not trained, disciplined and properly encouraged. Parents are the arbiters of society. They teach children how to behave so that other people will be able to interact meaningfully and productively with them. It is an act of responsibility to discipline a child. People often get basic psychological questions backwards. Why do people suffer from anxiety? That’s not a mystery. How is that people can ever be calm? There’s the mystery. Violence is the default. It’s easy. It’s peace that is difficult: learned, inculcated, earned. Parents must reward those attitudes and actions that will bring their child success in the world outside the family, and use threat and punishment when necessary to eliminate behaviours that will lead to misery and failure. Much more of our sanity than we commonly realize is a consequence of our fortunate immersion in a social community. Bad laws drive out respect for good laws. So, don’t encumber children with too many rules. “Limit the rules to what, exactly?” Here are some suggestions: Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don’t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don’t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you’re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you’re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you’re around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome everywhere. Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world. This obligation supersedes any responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost self-esteem. A child who pays attention, instead of drifting, and is comical, but not annoying, and is trustworthy - that child will have friends wherever he goes. It is possible to learn good by experiencing evil. The majority of people who were abused as children do not abuse their own children. The desire for vengeance, however justified, also bars the way to other productive thoughts. If it’s her fault, she might be able to do something about it. If it’s God’s fault, however - if reality itself is flawed - then she is doomed. A hurricane is an act of God. But failure to prepare, when the necessity for preparation is well known - that’s sin. Have you taken full advantage of the opportunities offered to you? Do you have habits that are destroying your health and well-being? Are you truly shouldering your responsibilities? Don’t reorganize the state until you have ordered your own experience. There is little difference between sacrifice and work. They are also both uniquely human. The discovery of the causal relationship between our efforts today and the quality of tomorrow motivated the social contract - the organization that enables today’s work to be stored, reliably, mostly in the form of promises from others. It takes a long time to learn to keep anything later for yourself. You are sharing with your future self. The future is largely composed of other human beings - often precisely those who have watched and evaluated and appraised the tiniest details of your past behavior. To share does not mean to give away something you value, and get nothing back. That is instead only what every child who refuses to share fears it means. To share means, properly, to initiate the process of trade. Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a newcomer to a neighbourhood ask a new neighbour to do him or her a favour. The latter could now ask the former for a favour, in return, because of the debt incurred, increasing their mutual familiarity and trust. In that manner both parties could overcome their natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the stranger. The society produced by Christianity was far less barbaric than the pagan - even the Roman - ones it replaced. Christian society at least recognized that feeding slaves to ravenous lions for the entertainment of the populace was wrong, even if many barbaric practices still existed. It objected to infanticide, to prostitution, and to the principle that might means right. It insisted that women were as valuable as men. This was asking the impossible, but it happened. After the solution is implemented, the fact that such problems had ever existed disappears from view. The fact that automobiles pollute only becomes a problem of sufficient magnitude to attract public attention when the far worse problems that the internal combustion engine solves has vanished from view. People stricken with poverty don’t care about carbon dioxide. Nietzsche described himself as philosophizing with a hammer. An idea that grips a person is alive. It wants to express itself, to live in the world. When an idea manifests itself within a person, it has a strong proclivity to make of that person its avatar: to impel that person to act it out. Sometimes the person will die, rather than allowing the idea to perish. Only the idea need die, and that the person with the idea can stop being its avatar, change his or her ways, and continue. Once you have placed “make the world better” at the top of your value hierarchy, you experience ever-deepening meaning. It’s how you make amends for the pathology of history. Expedience: That’s avoiding responsibility. It’s cowardly, and shallow, and wrong. There is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient. What should you do, when you don’t know what to do? Tell the truth. People define their utopia and then bend their lives into knots trying to make it reality. An eighteen-year-old decides, arbitrarily, that she wants to retire at fifty-two. She works for three decades to make that happen, failing to notice that she made that decision when she was little more than a child. What did she know about her fifty-two-year-old self, when still a teenager? Oversimplification and falsification is particularly typical of ideologues. They adopt a single axiom: government is bad, immigration is bad, capitalism is bad, patriarchy is bad. Then they filter and screen their experiences and insist ever more narrowly that everything can be explained by that axiom. If you will not reveal yourself to others, so much of what you could be will never be forced by necessity to come forward. New genes in the central nervous system turn themselves on when an organism is placed (or places itself) in a new situation. These are the building blocks for new structures in the brain. A lot of you will not be called forth by stasis. You have to say something, go somewhere and do things to get turned on. If you have a weak character, then adversity will mow you down when it appears. Everyone needs a concrete, specific goal - an ambition, and a purpose. An aim provides a destination. An aim defines progress and makes such progress exciting. If you have no aim everything can mean anything or nothing. Error necessitates sacrifice to correct it. Every bit of learning is a little death. Every bit of new information challenges a previous conception, forcing it to dissolve into chaos before it can be reborn as something better. Sometimes such deaths virtually destroy us. Advice is what you get when the person you’re talking with about something horrible and complicated wishes you would just shut up and go away. Advice is what you get when the person you are talking to wants to revel in the superiority of his or her own intelligence. There was no way of knowing the objective truth, and there never would be. There was no objective observer, and there never would be. There was no complete and accurate story. Memory is the past’s guide to the future. If you remember that something bad happened, and you can figure out why, then you can try to avoid that bad thing happening again. That’s the purpose of memory. It’s not “to remember the past.” It’s to stop the same damn thing from happening over and over. To think, you have to be at least two people at the same time. Then you have to let those people disagree. Thinking is an internal dialogue between two or more different views of the world. What are you to do, then, if you aren’t very good at thinking, at being two people at one time? That’s easy. You talk. But you need someone to listen. A listening person is your collaborator and your opponent. A listening person tests your talking (and your thinking) without having to say anything. Summarize to aid in consolidation and utility of memory. A long, meandering, emotion-laden account becomes shorter. It is now summed up in your memory It is now a better memory. It is now less weighty. It has been distilled; reduced to the gist. We have extracted the moral of the story. It becomes a description of the cause and the result of what happened, formulated such that repetition of the tragedy and pain becomes less likely in the future. “This is what happened. This is why. This is what I have to do to avoid such things from now on”: That’s a successful memory. That’s the purpose of memory. To discuss an event, particularly something emotional, like a death or serious illness, is to slowly choose what to leave behind. We use the reactions of others to keep our complex selves functional. People organize their brains with conversation. If they don’t have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves. Too-early problem-solving may indicate a desire to escape from the effort of the problem-formulating conversation. If you identify things, with careful attention and language, you bring them forward as viable, obedient objects, detaching them from their underlying near-universal interconnectedness. You simplify them. You make them specific and useful, and reduce their complexity. If you leave things vague, then this makes the world too complex to be managed. Consciously define the topic of a conversation, particularly when it is difficult. You must determine where you have been in your life, so that you can know where you are now. Otherwise you can’t get to where you’re going. Say what you mean, so you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are. Children weren’t trying to be safe — they were trying to become competent. It’s competence that makes people as safe as they can truly be. If things are made too safe, people (including children) start to figure out ways to make them dangerous again. When someone says, too loudly, “I stand for this!”, always wonder, “What, then, do you stand against?” If you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the consequences - and infer the motivation. If someone is taking advantage of you, you now face a moral obligation to speak up for yourself. Gather some evidence, strategically, so that when you confront that person, you can give them several examples of their misbehaviour (at least three), so they can’t easily weasel out of your accusations. It might mean failing to concede when they offer you their counterarguments. People rarely have more than four at hand. If you remain unmoved, they get angry, or cry, or run away. If you can push your point past the first four responses and stand fast against the consequent emotion, you will gain your target’s attention - and, perhaps, their respect. You must also know clearly what you want out of the situation, and be prepared to clearly articulate your desire. It’s a good idea to tell the person you are confronting exactly what you would like them to do instead of what they have done or currently are doing. Make your request as small and reasonable as possible - but ensure that its fulfillment would satisfy you. Come to the discussion with a solution, instead of just a problem. A woman should not look after a man, because she must look after children, and a man should not be a child. Women don’t want boys. They want someone to contend with; someone to grapple with. If they’re tough, they want someone tougher. If they’re smart, they want someone smarter. They desire someone who brings to the table something they can’t already provide. If you think tough men are dangerous, wait until you see what weak men are capable of. “Minimal group identification:” People are social because they like the members of their own group. People are antisocial because they don’t like the members of other groups. Cooperation is for safety, security and companionship. Competition is for personal growth and status. If a group is too small, it has no power or prestige, and cannot fend off other groups. Being one of its members is not that useful. If a group is too large, the probability of climbing to the top declines. So, it becomes too hard to get ahead. Sacrifice everything you hold dear to yet greater perfection. Let the deadwood burn off, so that new growth can prevail.","A unique thinker with strong opinions presented as indisputable fact. More surprisingly interesting ideas than almost any book I've ever read. Extremely thoughtful, but occasionally abruptly concludes with an unsupported point. It has a conservative “this is how it is” certainty. It’s a broad collection of thoughtful insights on life, mixed with a lot of Bible interpretation."
Sapiens,Yuval Noah Harari,0062316095,9,"Animals are said to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each other, giving birth to fertile offspring. Why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals: They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. There are no nations, no money, no human rights, no laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings. Lawyers call this a ‘legal fiction’. Under the right circumstances myths can change rapidly. In 1789 the French population switched almost overnight from believing in the myth of the divine right of kings to believing in the myth of the sovereignty of the people. One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding. Debates about Homo sapiens’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. Wheat, rice and potatoes: These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa. Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. Luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Today the world contains about a billion sheep, a billion pigs, more than a billion cattle, and more than 25 billion chickens. Domesticated cattle, pigs and sheep are the second, third and fourth most widespread large mammals in the world. Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success story, but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever lived. This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. A dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. Peasants almost never achieved economic security through their hard work in the present. Everywhere, rulers and elites sprang up, living off the peasants’ surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence. These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields When the Agricultural Revolution opened opportunities for the creation of crowded cities and mighty empires, people invented stories about great gods, motherlands and joint stock companies to provide the needed social links. Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers are both wrong. The only place where such universal principles exist is in the imagination. These principles have no objective validity. The American Declaration of Independence: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" People were not ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be ‘equal’. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that all souls are equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian myths about God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are ‘equal’? Evolution is based on difference, not on equality. Neither is there a ‘Creator’ who ‘endows’ them with anything. There is only a blind evolutionary process, devoid of any purpose. There are no such things as rights in biology. There are only organs, abilities and characteristics. Advocates of equality and human rights may be outraged by this line of reasoning. Their response is likely to be, ‘We know that people are not equal biologically! But if we believe that we are all equal in essence, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’ I have no argument with that. This is exactly what I mean by ‘imagined order’: We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. Hammurabi might have defended his principle of hierarchy using the same logic: ‘I know that superiors, commoners and slaves are not inherently different kinds of people. But if we believe that they are, it will enable us to create a stable and prosperous society.’ “There is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at night.” - Voltaire An imagined order is always in danger of collapse, because it depends upon myths, and myths vanish once people stop believing in them. A single priest often does the work of a hundred soldiers – far more cheaply and effectively. Medieval noblemen did not believe in individualism. Someone’s worth was determined by their place in the social hierarchy, and by what other people said about them. Being laughed at was a horrible indignity. Noblemen taught their children to protect their good name whatever the cost. The modern house is divided into many small rooms so that each child can have a private space, hidden from view, providing for maximum autonomy. Medieval castles rarely contained private rooms for children (or anyone else, for that matter). Children slept alongside many other youths in a large hall — always on display and always had to take into account what others saw and said. Someone growing up in such conditions naturally concluded that a man’s true worth was determined by his place in the social hierarchy and by what other people said of him. ‘Follow your heart.’ But the heart is a double agent that usually takes its instructions from the dominant myths of the day. Many of history’s most important drivers are inter-subjective: law, money, gods, nations. To change an existing imagined order, we must first believe in an alternative imagined order. Bees don’t need lawyers, because there is no danger that they might forget or violate the hive constitution. The Sumerians base-6 system bestowed on us the division of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees. More signs were added to the Sumerian system, gradually transforming it into a full script that we today call cuneiform. Other full scripts were developed in China around 1200 BC and in Central America around 1000–500 BC. 0 to 9 are known as Arabic numerals even though they were first invented by the Hindus. But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system, understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe. Every imagined hierarchy disavows its fictional origins and claims to be natural and inevitable. Hierarchies enable complete strangers to know how to treat one another without wasting the time and energy needed to become personally acquainted. Culture tends to argue that it forbids only that which is unnatural. But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural. Gender is a race in which some of the runners compete only for the bronze medal. Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality. The entire political history of the world since 1789 can be seen as a series of attempts to reconcile this contradiction. Contradictions are an inseparable part of every human culture. In fact, they are culture’s engines, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species. Just as when two clashing musical notes played together force a piece of music forward, so discord in our thoughts, ideas and values compel us to think, re-evaluate and criticise. Consistency is the playground of dull minds. The very spot where people teeter between two imperatives is where you’ll understand them best. From the viewpoint of a millennia rather than centuries, history is moving relentlessly towards unity. Empire has been the world’s most common form of political organisation for the last 2,500 years. Ideas, people, goods and technology spread more easily within the borders of an empire than in a politically fragmented region. This time the empire will be truly global. Whether to answer the imperial call or to remain loyal to their state and their people? More and more choose the empire. Religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and disunion. But religion has been the third great unifier of humankind, alongside money and empires. Since all social orders are imagined, they are all fragile. Religion has given superhuman legitimacy to these fragile structures. This helps place at least some fundamental laws beyond challenge, thereby ensuring social stability. Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. A leading theory about the origin of the gods: Gods such as the fertility goddess, the sky god and the god of medicine took centre stage when plants and animals lost their ability to speak, and the gods’ main role was to mediate between humans and the mute plants and animals. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. Communists believed that the law of nature was discovered by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Humanists believe that the unique nature of Homo sapiens is the most important thing in the world, and it determines the meaning of everything that happens in the universe. The supreme good is the good of Homo sapiens. The rest of the world and all other beings exist solely for the benefit of this species. The most important humanist sect is liberal humanism, which believes that ‘humanity’ is a quality of individual humans, and that the liberty of individuals is therefore sacrosanct. Another important sect is socialist humanism. Socialists believe that ‘humanity’ is collective rather than individualistic. They hold as sacred the species Homo sapiens as a whole. Socialist humanism seeks equality between all humans. Inequality is the worst blasphemy For sixty years after the end of the war against Hitler it was taboo to link humanism with evolution and to advocate using biological methods to ‘upgrade’ Homo sapiens. But today such projects are back in vogue. No one speaks about exterminating lower races or inferior people, but many contemplate using our increasing knowledge of human biology to create superhumans. To acknowledge that history is not deterministic is to acknowledge that it is just a coincidence that most people today believe in nationalism, capitalism and human rights. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise. History’s choices are not made for the benefit of humans. There is absolutely no proof that human well-being inevitably improves as history rolls along. There is no proof that cultures that are beneficial to humans must inexorably succeed and spread, while less beneficial cultures disappear. Because we lack an objective scale on which to measure such benefit. Different cultures define the good differently, and we have no objective yardstick by which to judge between them. No matter what you call it – game theory, postmodernism or memetics – the dynamics of history are not directed towards enhancing human well-being. Modern science differs from all previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways: * The willingness to admit ignorance. * The centrality of observation and mathematics. * The acquisition of new powers. In 1620 Francis Bacon argued that the real test of ‘knowledge’ is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us. It is not enough to survey the achievements of physicists, biologists and sociologists. We have to take into account the ideological, political and economic forces that shaped physics, biology and sociology, pushing them in certain directions while neglecting others. The feedback loop between science, empire and capital has arguably been history’s chief engine for the past 500 years. In 1775 Asia accounted for 80 per cent of the world economy. The global centre of power shifted to Europe only between 1750 and 1850. What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern world? Modern science and capitalism. Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages. When the technological bonanza began, Europeans could harness it far better than anybody else. When the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring along archaeologists to systematically study Indian history, anthropologists to study Indian cultures, geologists to study Indian soils, or zoologists to study Indian fauna. When the British conquered India, they did all of these things. On 10 April 1802 the Great Survey of India was launched. It lasted sixty years. British officers arriving in India were supposed to spend up to three years in a Calcutta college, where they studied Hindu and Muslim law alongside English law; Sanskrit, Urdu and Persian alongside Greek and Latin; and Tamil, Bengali and Hindustani culture alongside mathematics, economics and geography. Imperialists claimed that their empires were not vast enterprises of exploitation but rather altruistic projects to benefit the conquered populations and bring them the benefits of ‘progress’ – to provide them with medicine and education, to build railroads and canals, to ensure justice and prosperity. Of course, the facts often belied this myth. The European empires did so many different things on such a large scale, that you can find plenty of examples to support whatever you want to say about them. Credit enables us to build the present at the expense of the future. It’s founded on the assumption that our future resources are sure to be far more abundant than our present resources. Why did nobody think of it earlier? They didn’t trust that the future would be better than the present. Business looked like a zero-sum game. Then came the Scientific Revolution and the idea of progress. Whoever believes in progress believes that inventions and organisational developments can increase the sum total of human production, trade and wealth. In 1776 the Scottish economist Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, probably the most important economics manifesto of all time. Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase private profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political perspective. What Smith says is, in fact, that greed is good, and that by becoming richer I benefit everybody, not just myself. Egoism is altruism. Smith taught people to think about the economy as a ‘win-win situation’, in which my profits are also your profits. The first and most sacred commandment of Capitalism is: ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’ That’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. A pharaoh who pours resources into a non-productive pyramid is not a capitalist. A hard-working factory hand who reinvests part of his income in the stock market is. They spend a much smaller part of their profits on non-productive activities. No history of modern science can leave capitalism out of the picture. A project that can’t increase production and profits has little chance of finding a sponsor. Conversely, the history of capitalism is unintelligible without taking science into account. Capitalism’s belief in perpetual economic growth flies in the face of almost everything we know about the universe. A country’s credit rating is far more important to its economic well-being than are its natural resources. Credit ratings indicate the probability that a country will pay its debts. The most important economic resource is trust in the future, and this resource is constantly threatened by thieves and charlatans. Einstein determined that any kind of mass could be converted into energy – that’s what E = mc² means. The Industrial Revolution has been a revolution in energy conversion. The only limit to the amount of energy at our disposal is set by our ignorance. The Industrial Revolution was above all else the Second Agricultural Revolution. Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world. In medieval Europe, aristocrats spent their money carelessly on extravagant luxuries, whereas peasants lived frugally, minding every penny. Today, the tables have turned. The rich take great care managing their assets and investments, while the less well heeled go into debt buying cars and televisions they don’t really need. In 1784 a carriage service with a published schedule began operating in Britain. Its timetable specified only the hour of departure, not arrival. Back then, each British city and town had its own local time, which could differ from London time by up to half an hour. When it was 12:00 in London, it was perhaps 12:20 in Liverpool and 11:50 in Canterbury. In 1847, British train companies put their heads together and agreed that henceforth all train timetables would be calibrated to Greenwich Observatory time, rather than the local times of Liverpool, Manchester or Glasgow. GMT. The Ottoman Empire allowed family vendettas to mete out justice, rather than supporting a large imperial police force. If my cousin killed somebody, the victim’s brother might kill me in sanctioned revenge. The sultan in Istanbul or even the provincial pasha did not intervene in such clashes, as long as violence remained within acceptable limits. In the Chinese Ming Empire (1368–1644), the population was organised into the baojia system. Ten families were grouped to form a jia, and ten jia constituted a bao. When a member of a bao commited a crime, other bao members could be punished for it, in particular the bao elders. Taxes too were levied on the bao, and it was the responsibility of the bao elders rather than of the state officials to assess the situation of each family and determine the amount of tax it should pay. A person who lost her family and community around 1750 was as good as dead. Most nations argue that they are a natural and eternal entity, created in some primordial epoch by mixing the soil of the motherland with the blood of the people. Yet such claims are usually exaggerated. Nations existed in the distant past, but their importance was much smaller than today because the importance of the state was much smaller. A resident of medieval Nuremberg might have felt some loyalty towards the German nation, but she felt far more loyalty towards her family and local community. The Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Iraqi nations are the product of haphazard borders drawn in the sand by French and British diplomats who ignored local history, geography and economy. These diplomats determined in 1918 that the people of Kurdistan, Baghdad and Basra would henceforth be ‘Iraqis’. It was primarily the French who decided who would be Syrian. Any attempt to define the characteristics of modern society is akin to defining the colour of a chameleon. The only characteristic of which we can be certain is the incessant change. In 2002 there were 741,000 victims of human violence. In contrast, 873,000 people committed suicide. The decline of violence is due largely to the rise of the state. Throughout history, most violence resulted from local feuds. Since 1945, no independent country recognised by the UN has been conquered and wiped off the map. Power corrupts. As humankind gained more and more power, it created a cold mechanistic world ill-suited to our real needs. Despite all the political, social, ideological and economic upheavals brought about by the French Revolution, its impact on French happiness was small. Those who won a cheerful biochemistry in the genetic lottery were just as happy before the revolution as after. Those with a gloomy biochemistry complained about Robespierre and Napoleon with the same bitterness with which they earlier complained about Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. If so, what good was the French Revolution? If people did not become any happier, then what was the point of all that chaos, fear, blood and war? The keys to happiness are in the hands of our biochemical system, we can stop wasting our time on politics and social reforms, putsches and ideologies, and focus instead on the only thing that can make us truly happy: manipulating our biochemistry. Lasting happiness comes only from serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin. The scientist who says her life is meaningful because she increases the store of human knowledge, the soldier who declares that his life is meaningful because he fights to defend his homeland, and the entrepreneur who finds meaning in building a new company are no less delusional than their medieval counterparts who found meaning in reading scriptures, going on a crusade or building a new cathedral. Most males spend their lives competing and fighting, instead of enjoying peaceful bliss, because their DNA manipulates them for its own selfish aims. The real root of suffering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings. In meditation, you are supposed to closely observe your mind and body, witness the ceaseless arising and passing of all your feelings, and realise how pointless it is to pursue them. When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied. True happiness is independent of our inner feelings. The more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.","I resisted reading this popular history of mankind, because it came out when I had just finished “Guns, Germs, and Steel” and “Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches”, on the same subject. But wow - this book is at its best when the author is sharing his personal perspective about binding myths, humanism, and other ways that “truths” are not true. And you get an interesting history of the world along with it. Strange mix of history and philosophy."
Happy,Derren Brown,0552172359,9,"The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived lives of the parents. Don’t become so annoyed by someone that you become a source of annoyance to others. No one has the direct means to affect your self-control or dignity. Everyone thinks the limits of their own field of vision are the limits of the world. The story you tell yourself of your life is a confabulation. Don’t mistake your constructed life story as the truth. You are not characters in a movie whose personalities are clearly defined and predictable. You can act out of character. A placebo transformed volunteers because they gave themselves permission to act differently. “I am no longer the person with this problem, because a new medicine is solving that for me.” Blind faith is more commonly a recipe for disaster than for triumph. That would be obvious if failed businessmen could sell their biographies as well as the successful ones. Biographies of successful, strong entrepreneurs adhering to a vision, no matter what, and having no time for those who would get in the way or did not share the hero’s Herculean self-belief? This success story is also a recipe for failure. What could be more conducive to financial disaster than blindly ignoring all advice? Many more will fail than succeed through blind self-belief. Plan for success. Prepare for failure. A snappy, self-assured “Ignore the h8ers” can be a dangerous folly. By removing or ignoring the sources of honest feedback, you create a downward spiral of self-deception. Life is chess. Your plan is affected by the inclinations of the other player. You must modify your plan constantly. You know that after you snack you will be hungry again soon. But this thought does not trouble you. It is part of an endless chain of desires: you will eat, then, after a while, desire to eat again. The problem is when you fail to see the same process in your less essential desires. Your desires would diminish drastically if you didn’t need to impress anyone. The things you desire really do little other than fuel further desires and teach you what greed is. Envy comes from proximity, not disproportion. Your cognitions, perceptions, attitudes and conceptions of yourself are all tied in with those to whom you liken or contrast yourself. The places and things that insist most loudly that they will make you happy rarely do. Joy prefers to arrive quietly and alone elsewhere, unceremoniously and unannounced. Meanwhile, you search for happiness in distractions. Many people who search for a consolidating philosophy tend to be eternal “seekers”, never quite comfortable in their own skin and every few years adopting a fresh external source of guidance or following some new charismatic leader. A way of living can come from due thought rather than a passive immersion in the tangles of everyday distractions. Your philosophy can be highly flexible and subject to great changes, but the important point is to have one. It does not need to be easily describable in its entirety, or clearly attributable to any philosophical school. It should stand up to scrutiny and enquiry, being thought through and considered. It must give you a solid foundation without limiting you by insisting on a set of beliefs. If you don’t identify and engage with your stories, you might quickly find yourself at the mercy of whatever voices happen to be loudest around you. Death bed regrets: Why should the anticipation of future introspective thoughts triggered by illness in the final few months of your life dictate the choices you make now and for decades ahead? You could spend your life exploring pleasurable activities and still come to the end with regretting. So what if you do? Is it not potentially just as disastrous to live your life with the goal of dying without regret, just to find that you regret not living for the moment while you could? You don’t make decisions based on your experiences. You make them based on the stories of your experiences. You should be more concerned with this remembering self. Pampering the experiencing self is not enough; you want memories too. Your bestial experiencing self has an attention span of about three seconds. Its reports are quickly superseded by those of its story-loving, identity-forming superior. You care a lot about endings when you consider stories. They tend to define the character of the whole tale. Your centre of gravity is rooted within yourself. Work, health, family and friends still make their demands, but you can acknowledge and entertain those forces without feeling them impose directly upon your core self. Your happiness resides quietly in the epicentre of your emotional life, an area before which you can raise the drawbridge, and from time to time close off from outside threat. Schopenhauer was referred to as the philosopher of pessimism. He writes about escaping the base and unpleasant forces in life and finding greater happiness. It is more rewarding to read such advice from a philosopher whose initial presumptions about life are negative. Schopenhauer’s ideal is to be wealthy enough to have expansive free time and the intellectual capabilities to fill it with contemplation and activity in the service of mankind. Pain and boredom are the two foes of human happiness. When your stability relies principally on external factors, you shuttle back and forth between the two. Use your intellect to rise above your instincts. The more certain you appear about something, the less you know about it. The sign of the true expert is his modest awareness of how much more there is to know; how complex and nuanced the subject at hand insists on remaining. Non-conformity might work as a temporary rite of passage to a more independent place. But “fuck you” is too much about the “you”. If you proudly walk on the opposite side of the road as everyone else, then you’d be forced to cross the road if everyone else decided to switch sides. When you shut parts of yourself off, they re-emerge as pathologies and anxieties, or reasons for therapy. Pay attention to your anxieties, ask where they come from and of what difficult episodes in the past they remind you. Treat them as deep messages to enable you to reconsider your priorities. If your walls are severely cracked, no amount of wallpaper will solve the problem. When you make these blueprints for your life, you want to have the best advice. Some people may be happy to hand over responsibility to a single architect and have him do all the work and decision-making. Religion offers this relinquishing of responsibility. Most “complete” solutions remove the need to continue asking the kind of existential questions the considered life provokes. The answers have been provided for you. No one philosophy is perfect, but even if there were a perfect philosophy, who could perfectly apply it? Philosophy rarely concerns itself with empirical research, preferring instead a vertical approach: an opportunity for an individual journey of deep understanding. Humans can know themselves. You can use your reason to examine your unconscious beliefs and values. Humans can change themselves. You can use your reason to change your beliefs. This will change your emotions, because your emotions follow your beliefs. Humans can consciously create new habits of thinking, feeling and acting. If you follow philosophy as a way of life, you can live more flourishing life. A person living a considered and truly affirmed life would be happy for it to be lived over and over again. In history, you can find the most effective answers to improving your happiness. In Greek tragedies, audiences followed a hero trying to impose order (the Apollonian urge) on whatever random fate threw his way (the Dionysian drive). You should rise above an attraction to beauty in a particular person. Allow yourself to be drawn to a more general picture of beauty. And finally to the Idea of beauty itself as an archetype, with little erotic regard for mere mortal examples of it. In other words: move from sexual attraction to a kind of contemplation. The Idea of beauty is part of a realm more real than the beautiful things you see every day. The things and qualities of your everyday world are like shadows cast on a back wall of a cave. You look at the shadows and mistake them for real things, but you miss the fact that they are mere silhouettes. Comprehending these true objects – the Ideas – constitutes the most authentic way of living. Science operates on the same principle as the Idea of beauty. Scientific truth is not about looking within yourself. Good science bypass subjective experience and human error to describe as accurately as possible the “Truth”. Recognize what you like about somebody. Admire it as a quality separate from that particular person, rather than confusing it with him or her. What you admire about them are qualities that exist separately from the particular (and therefore flawed) example that they constitute. (This also has therapeutic value if you find yourself infatuated with someone.) Learn from the qualities you like in someone. Develop it in yourself. Recognize it in others. Positive qualities you like about someone continue to reside in them even when they seem to have lost all their redeeming aspects. The loss of self that you feel when worshipping another can feel intoxicating. But it hurts when their all-too-human qualities become apparent. A person will never embody the qualities you perceive in them as perfectly as you might imagine. Socratic happiness was indistinguishable from a rising above, a virtuous elevation, a higher plateau. Be good, rather than know goodness. Excessive behaviours are easier to exhibit than virtues. Ethics have muscle-memory. Practice acting in a way until it comes naturally. Devoting yourself to intellectual pursuits is the best sort of virtuous activity. You can enjoy trivial pleasures, but these should only be in preparation for activities in accordance with virtue. The experiencing self might enjoy a few hours of gaming. But the remembering self forms a painful story in which you have let yourself down. Your remembering, story-forming self needs a narrative of happiness in the same way your experiencing self requires its pleasures. Daily irritations are a test that teaches you virtue, and, step by step, moving towards being a better version of yourself. People take longer-lasting pleasure from being kind to others than having others be kind to them. There is a deeper happiness to be had in knowing that your life is part of a story of flourishing than there is in merely pursuing entertainment. Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics is surprisingly immediate and accessible. Aristotle felt an attachment to things for their own sake is a healthy part of the good life. This was a much more pragmatic and relaxed approach to attachment than would follow in subsequent schools. Epicureanism: good and evil are no more than a matter of pleasure and pain; to live well is about maximizing the first and minimizing the second. Epicureanism: indulgence in fine food and drink were rejected because it was seen as eventually causing more pain (hangover, illness, frustrated desire for further luxuries) than the fleeting pleasure they might provide in the moment. Epicureans lived a simple, ascetic life, believing that by limiting themselves to a few natural desires (such as friendship, bread and water), they would be far happier than those who finally bring pain upon themselves through entertaining greater needs. Pleasures were rationally chosen, so that they would not ultimately lead to misery. Epicurus gave his followers slogans to memorize, so they could spring easily to mind when most needed. (such as “He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing”) Slogans can help deal with adversity or disturbance without recourse to detailed thought or study. Epicurus tells you you have nothing more than your animalistic bodily senses to put to use. If you pay attention to what they tell you, you will find that the good life, of the highest pleasure, also happens to be the simplest. Happiness came in the form of tranquillity. Utilitarianism equated goodness with the ability to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people. You might scoff at religious people who believe that sacred icons are mystic avatars. But you are still prone to the same superstitious thinking. To appreciate this, try taking a knife and repeatedly stabbing a photograph of a loved one, and preferably one who has recently passed away. You’ll soon appreciate the power of the graven image. You have a “meaning-shaped hole” because we are story-forming creatures, and stories should not meander without a point. John Stuart Mill, the English Utilitarian, lost faith in the idea of happiness as our ultimate human goal. What should replace it? Liberty, self-realisation and personal freedom. In developing your individuality, you become more valuable to yourself, and therefore capable of being more valuable to others. Develop and strengthen those parts of you that feel unique. You can contribute more to society as a distinct, idiosyncratic individual. And therefore, ultimately, be of more use to the world. The differences between people in a relationship are part of what makes it valuable. See the qualities that separate them from you as precisely the features to celebrate. Happiness is achieved indirectly through individual liberation from the levelling demands of society. A reaction against a movement tends to inherit its structure. To become happier, you need to feel differently about things that cause (or have the potential to cause) anxiety. You must change your emotional experiences. Train yourself to feel satisfied with what comes more easily. That way, you are far more likely to reach a point of relatively undisturbed happy contentment. Everything you need is easy to procure, while the things you desire but don’t need are more difficult to obtain. Neediness is the destroyer of love. You can never get enough from people towards whom you feel needy. If you were sure that you could get by happily enough without this relationship, it’s easier to be less demanding and enjoy what the other person chooses to give. If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. You can wipe out that judgement now. Feelings are provoked by an exhausting little voice inside your head. These intermediary thoughts step in and interpret external events as a good reason to feel bad, mad or scared. You make a judgement about the event and then react to that verdict. Some school of thought says that intellect is of the mind and emotions are of the body - thinking you are born with your capacity for grief and anger and despair in place, whereas you learn reasoning through the society in which you live. The Greeks, however, were not of this opinion. Emotions stem from how you interpret events. Your emotions are in essence “cognitive” and will change and shift as those beliefs are modified. You can see them as fundamentally rational. Radically reappraising the role of feelings in order to create a life of increased tranquillity. The metaphor of “letting off steam” comes from, not surprisingly, the time of the locomotive engine. Freud was fascinated by this invention, and for him it was a powerful metaphor for human emotion. By comparison today, your language for the brain is rooted in computer-talk and its language of “reprogramming”. In Freud’s time, too much built-up steam, not allowed to escape in some harmless way, was believed to create a neurosis. Today, it feels more “modern” to talk about someone’s brain “processing” messages in a certain way or needing “rewiring”. Steam and computer metaphors amount to the attempts of different eras to come to grips with something beyond their understanding by using a model of a technology dazzling and complex but just about graspable. Reconsider your judgements in a way that helps you. While being tortured on the rack, be able to smile and think “This is happening to my body, but it isn’t happening to me.” Take responsibility for your emotions, rather than insisting the rest of the world recognise them and respond with perennial sympathy. If you insist that you are purely the victim of your situation, consider whether someone else might respond differently to it. If you can imagine that, then your emotional response is not the events but the way you deal with them. Compare this to the experience of hating certain foods but realising that others can eat them quite happily. Things themselves do not dictate your responses. You can expect to feel the first automatic flush of emotion, but you can then choose not to replay the event again and again in your minds and make yourself feel terrible. Don’t try to change things you cannot control. Under your control are your thoughts and actions. Not under your control is everything else, including fame, power, the behaviour and thoughts of other people, your property and your reputation. Everything you learned about yourself from your parents when you were a child: Those areas where your caregivers were stuck, will have impacted upon you like a script, dictating what you should seek or avoid in the world. You will learn strengths from them, but also fears and needs: your own personal ways of feeling a bit scared. Unhelpfully, these needs will feel to you entirely normal and rational! Unconscious parent-created fears and needs will resurface when you later enter a significant relationship, as you project them on to your new partner. Although you profess to be in love, and to have lost yourself in this other person, you are barely (at this early point) doing them the justice of considering them an actual human being. They begin as a projection of your needs; you hope that he or she will be the perfect match, the magical “other” who will satisfy us. It is only when you stop projecting your needs – which first means becoming conscious of them as needs – that you can release the other person from the tyranny of your expectations. In a relationship, least stable partner will tend to project the most, thereby commonly setting the agenda for the couple. Both may find themselves living the script set down by the past experiences of the needier partner. Celebrate your romantic partner as an entire, separate human being, one with some disappointing peculiarities it is up to you to navigate, accommodate, forgive. The urge for control over something is almost overwhelming. Feeling uneasy in conversation at a dinner party, you arrange the scattered objects before you on the table at neat right angles. You project your needs on to food in the way you do with your partners. Many people overstuffing to feed a spiritual hunger or denying themselves in order to establish a secure area of jurisdiction. A neurotic impulse that comes from an avoidance of deep dialogue with the self. If you fixate on the thought “I must win this game”, then you are trying to control something that you cannot. You can identify that it isn’t within your control and tell yourself it’s fine and none of your business. Instead, you can enter the game with the aim of “I will play this game as well as I can.” Even if that instruction it’s fine takes a while to truly make itself felt in your bones, you have a clear target that you are aiming. Permit nothing to grow to you that may give you agony when it is torn away. Learn to value those things more by appreciating their transience in your life, and you are more prepared for the moment you lose them. Mentally rehearse losing everything you have. The word “attachment” might be misleading: Surely you wouldn’t want to care less about your loved ones? Are you being seriously asked to distance yourself? No. Express your feelings to those you love now while you can, to never take them for granted. Anyone who adopted these principles in the age you are considering was called a philosopher. The term referred to someone who lived in a certain way, not only to someone who spent his time contemplating or devising systems of thought. The two big questions you might ask yourself when you are feeling mad, bad or sad: I am responsible for how I feel about external events. What am I doing to give myself this feeling? Is this thing that’s upsetting me something which lies under my control? If not, what if I were to decide it’s fine and let it go? Stick with your first impressions of things, and do not embellish the story. A neurotic or anxious person prides herself on being “perceptive” when it comes to people, as if the legacy of a perennially unsettling childhood would be powers of observation as cool and perspicacious as Sherlock Holmes. This wariness you mistake for insight; you thus decide from a place of insecurity what truth is and find evidence for it everywhere. You too easily work to consolidate and bolster your insecurities by confirming to yourself your worst fears. No one confines his unhappiness to the present. Memory brings back the agony of fear while foresight brings it on prematurely. You need to practice. If you don’t do something for a long time, it is difficult to then do it when you need to. Get ahead of the game. Make provision for negative events before they arise. Anger is driven by a desire for revenge: to harm another person. You perceive yourself to have been slighted, ignored, disregarded or otherwise unfairly treated or perceived. To feel anger is unavoidable but not in itself helpful; the key is turning it into something constructive. You are angry because you would like to change something in the world. Anger pulls you from your natural state of openness and turns you against humanity. Call anger by another name: panic. Usually, when you are angry, you are scared. You are scared that someone’s actions will leave you helpless, or in some way betrayed, overwhelmed or abandoned. You might be scared that you will lose your autonomy. You are angry with others for not doing their jobs properly, because you in turn are then forced to struggle even more under your own pressures. You are angry at bad service because you feel yourself being undermined or unheard. You tend to suffer from the fear of abandonment or the fear of being overwhelmed. The former tends to make you meet stress with anxiety, the latter to retreat. If, when angry with someone, you first allow them to explain themselves, and if you actually listen to what they say, you can allow your anger to dissolve. Expressing your unhappiness in a sensitive way is one of the most productive things you can do in a relationship. Do you want to avoid losing your temper? Resist the impulse to be curious. The man who tries to find out what has been said against him, who seeks to unearth spiteful gossip, even when engaged in privately, is destroying his own peace of mind. The problem is not the nastiness of the online comments; it is the fact that you are choosing to read them. When faced with the distress of others, you tend to assume a calming role. You keep accounts badly: you rate high what you have paid out but low what you have been paid. You have an inflated sense of your own entitlement. The hallmark of the truly successful: quiet charm. His manner was masterfully understated; every action, every inch of his appearance made me feel honoured to meet a man I had never heard of. Talking to me, he was utterly engaged and present, two hallmarks of charisma, and, like an actor playing a king, he let other people confer status upon him, playing none of it himself. When you are happy, you have won the game, and the fact is self-evident; there’s no need to broadcast the victory. Two common mistakes when you try to be liked: you either try to impress or you try to be like the other person. Most people are drawn to basic qualities such as warmth and openness. The person eager to impress might find it very difficult to freely compliment people, believing that to commend another would be to denigrate himself. Self-abnegation is a powerful key to social appeal. You are drawn to the person who lets you know how fascinating you are. A large part of improving the “self” is to shift the focus from “self” to “other”. A jar of threads: try to remove one and the whole bundle comes out with it. A friend’s occasional spinelessness is impossible to untangle from his striking kindness of which you are so fond. You are prone to switching off your empathy when it would require you to relate to antisocial acts. This blinkering effect of decency: where you make it hard for yourself to understand “evil” acts of wrongdoers. This is disingenuous of us, because, as you have seen, we all act from standpoints that are logical to us. You yourself would very likely react in the same way if you found yourself in entirely the same position. Thus you become angry rather than make any attempt to understand, as if trying to appreciate common ground were tantamount to the endorsing of or sympathising with the offending act. Total adherence to one school of thought or another is likely to deny the important and beneficial expression of part of your nature. To merely label oneself a “Stoic” is to renounce one’s own voice. A considered life should not, like the pious one, be a matter of subjugation to any label. Street photography: noticing the poetry of the everyday. I feel both detached from the world yet feel very connected to people around me. I am paying far more attention to them than normal; I’m far more interested in life. I’m attracted to people and the snapshots of life that show through their postures and faces; I am drawn to the geometry of architecture and bodies. I become interested in the relationships between them and the possibilities of something lovely and serendipitous arising from that interplay of a real fascination with everything human. The secret magical formula for success: TALENT + ENERGY Formula for being a star: STYLE + ATTITUDE A recognisable style and a certain attitude that surrounds stars as a kind of aura. Your world will all amount to nothing. Terminal illness is a weird kind of privilege. Unlike the swift, brutal finality of a heart attack or road traffic accident, I have been granted the honour to plan and prepare both myself, and my family, for what is to come. You gain from knowing that you are going to die and having the chance to act on that knowledge. So long as you exist, death is not with you; but when death comes, then you do not exist. Death can’t be bad for you, because you won’t be around to experience it. You are constantly involved in projects. These projects point you towards the future. Death deprives you of seeing your projects come to some sort of fruition, and of engaging in fresh ones. Death can harm you while you are alive, because you wish to continue your projects and extend your engagements into a continuing future, and death thwarts those desires. To live forever: How many times would you have to fall in love before the prospect of yet another attachment filled you with tedium? How many friends would come and go before the very idea of making any social effort seemed pointless? When would you stop bothering? Without death, any sense of urgency is lost. Everything worthwhile in your life draws its meaning from the fact you will die. You need death in order to live. The meaning of life is that it stops. Grief is an honest expression of loss and of how much you treasured someone who has now gone. It can be painful, but it goes hand-in-hand with the things you value. When that time comes, no one talks about it. Dying: A conspiracy of silence descends, and dying often becomes very, very lonely. Unwilling to upset or burden those she loves, the dying person does not speak about her fears to her family and friends. Horrified at the thought of saying the wrong thing or appearing to “write off” their dying beloved, the living do everything to avoid mentioning it as well. Instead, a new modern narrative is imposed on the situation, that of the “brave battle”. This tale, in truth designed only to keep the living happy, can put further pressure on the person facing death and alienate her from the possibility of a deep richness that only acceptance can bring. By forcing “positive mental attitude”, health-care professionals are not allowing patients to face reality. Our cultural obsession with goal-setting and optimism has blindly swum into waters far too deep and dark. “Believe in yourself; you can beat this thing”: the message is no different from any manual about achieving your ambitions. Death, you remember, does not round off a life with the satisfying ending of a novel or a film. It does not “complete”; it curtails. It is up to you to bring the story to a close by recognising it as such. For you to own your death, to author it and to shape it, is tremendously important. You are the protagonist and the author. If you do not insist on this central role, you may find yourself reduced to a mere cameo. Others, stronger in body and in number, may take the leading role if you do not. Your choices must steer the process. Abraham Maslow’s pyramid: As you sense your time on this Earth is getting shorter, your prime concerns “descend” within the pyramid to the here and now: to relationships and everyday pleasures. Your current priorities don’t match those you will later wish you had. It is natural for your needs to be different when your life still extends brightly before us. The needs of a present that has a future are different from one that does not. The need for self-actualisation, for example, at the top of Maslow’s pyramid, may demand certain sacrifices along the way, and may need time to come into fulfilment. The instruction to pay more attention to the present moment is helpful in a culture that teaches you to prioritise distant horizons of career success. Be wary of fetishising the here and now. It is not “correct” to live in the moment. We are storytellers and right now is always part of a continuing narrative. How you look back on this moment will be more conducive to deciding if it’s a happy one, than how you feel about it right now. The only “should” you need ever take on board is that you “should” get on with your life without hurting other people. Be aware of how you are likely to later judge your current actions and check that we’re not wasting time. As your priorities at the end shift towards the simple, the immediate and the social, your other previous concerns may appear misguided. But this sounds like a product, again, of storytelling: it would be very easy to look back and see a story of missed opportunities, now that they are running out. It doesn’t mean you were making mistakes at the time, when horizons were further away. The key to avoiding regret may lie as much in what story you choose to tell yourself in the future as it does in what you do or don’t do now. All you can do is try to anticipate that future narrative and let it gently guide some of your choices up front. You’ll never regret falling in love. Do so over and over again. Faced with a choice of doing a job for the money or doing a job for the fun of it, take the fun one whenever you can. You’ll rarely enjoy the work you do for money. Although the physicality of death destroys us, the idea of death saves us. You generally feel defined by your past. Your past, however, is a story that you tell yourself in the present. On the one hand it is a narrative, and on the other hand it is true. Situations can fling you back without any room for rational appraisal to those times when you suffered. Now feels like then. Seek a perspective that allows you to see the story for what it is. Without gaining something of a detached vantage point and identifying your stories for what they are, you will still remain prey to your deep-seated beliefs about who you are and how the world must work, mistake them for concrete reality and inflict them upon your loved ones and everyone else. Consciously note the way your unconscious machinations bring these old patterns to the fore, and then, where you can, quietly smile at them. Be grateful to your unconscious for looking out for you, while also acknowledging that it’s being hilariously oversensitive. Each time you gently deny it its power by nipping it in the bud through your own amusement, and practise instead a new response, you break these old neural connections and form a new pathway. Age doesn’t obliterate your individual traits and identities. On the contrary, it heightens them. The approach of death gives you a chance to pay attention to how your life might affect those you know. You are dealing with the end of your story, and it is the end of the story that colours the rest. You remember that what happens in the final chapter of a book or the final scene of a movie is the key to how you feel about the entire tale. If you have the opportunity, you can make sure that despite the effect you may have had on a person in the past, you can finish the story well and ripple positively into that person. Knowing that life after your deaths will continue with positive memories of you in place might help you to engage richly and simply in your life, and end your stories as satisfyingly as possible. When you value something, you see reasons to preserve it over time. By valuing something, you make a judgement about how an aspect of the future should be. When the future is removed from the equation, you lose this sense of what you value. You need to die, and you also need others to live on after you, and without you. The continuing lives of others matter more to you than do your own. If not in the body and not in the soul, where is that person’s “self” housed? Perhaps it is in their personality. Your patterns of thinking can be experienced by other people too. For a while I think and feel like you (perhaps while contemplating how you would behave in a certain situation). A mature relationship involves celebrating the mystery and wholeness of one’s partner. It is standing in appreciation of their otherness, not neurotically attempting to obliterate it because at some level their separation from you might trigger responses you once had to a fallible, unavailable parent. No one is ever entirely right for you because you are all broken. Your ultimate aim is maybe not so much to be happy as to live fully and make sure you are moving forward. Disturbance, then, can be a signal that you are moving in the right direction: namely, out of your comfort zone. To remain tranquil and comfortable would deny you your growth. To remain happy would stop you from flourishing. The things that remain unconscious are always in charge.","Brilliant and profound yet totally entertaining philosophy book by one of my favorite people. Gives an approachable overview of past philosophies and shows how they apply to your life today better than the harmful pop-self-help-positivity stuff. Amazing perspectives on desires, death, relationships, anger, and how being present doesn’t matter as much as the story you tell yourself afterwards. He has a fun writing style that’s not reflected in my notes here. Get the book."
Au Contraire: Figuring Out the French,Gilles Asselin and Ruth Mastron,1931930929,9,"Interculturalists use the iceberg metaphor to describe culture. 10 percent is visible: obvious elements such as art, literature, music, dance, traditional dress, and cuisine. 90 percent remains hidden, apparent only after an extended period of living in another culture. Values, beliefs, assumptions, notions of morality, and, in general, rules about what is and is not done. Spending substantial time abroad also allows us to understand the hidden elements of our own culture. Enter the assumptive world of the other culture to understand how it works and makes sense. Look beyond what we are given to see. Look for the subtle, invisible connections. Imagine you have an elderly relative who is very ill and the prognosis is not good. You have to convey this message to three other people: a small child, a young adult, and an older person. This communication would need to be adapted for your message to be delivered effectively. This example illustrates the central skill of intercultural communication: You are not changing who you are, only how you present yourself and your message. French and Americans both see their own social model as the best for others. And in this, they differ from most other cultures! Many cultures see their own way of life as preferable or even superior, but the United States and France have sought to bring the benefits of their systems to the rest of the world. What Makes the French So French? French icons: Marianne, Astérix, and the rooster: Marianne is the feminine symbol of the French Republic and represents the daring bravery of Frenchwomen fighting for the Revolution, for freedom. The very words republic, revolution, and freedom are feminine in French. Marianne continues to represent France in the European Union, appearing on French-minted Euro coins, and as a statue in every town hall. Astérix and his friends are symbols of the French inclination toward resistance and rebellion. The rooster wakes up the entire village at dawn, attracts attention from others, and never retreats from his defiant and domineering attitude toward the rest of the coop. French roosters like to remind everyone that France has awakened the entire world to the beauty and grace of its civilization, culture, and language. France is abound in contradictions: Deeply conservative yet avant-garde, dispassionately rational yet given to wildly dramatic outbursts of anger or affection, reserved with strangers yet passionate romantics. The country has a vaguely hexagonal shape. An actual geometric hexagon often serves as a visual shorthand for France, and summaries of domestic news in the media are headlined simply L’Hexagone. The French think of themselves as supremely rational beings - logical and intellectual. They have a high regard for reasoning, and their schooling places a premium on philosophy. The realm of ideas for their own sake is valued and respected. The vision of their country as a geometric structure - neat, tidy, organized, and clear - confirms their prowess and pride in matters of the mind. Cartesian thinking, refers to the proper approach, rather than on practical applications. Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité! - unity, solidarity, and universalism. France is one united country and one indivisible republic. Regions with a strongly marked local identity make their point with particular customs, languages, and traditions rather than with calls for self-determination or political autonomy. A single system treating everyone the same is seen as most fair and equitable. Centralization in the form of a centralized administration and bureaucracy has been the one stable feature in all of France’s political landscapes. Louis XIV was not speaking metaphorically when he said, “L’état, c’est moi!” Paris is not just the capital but virtually the center of the French universe. It is the nation’s political, literary, historic, economic, artistic, financial, and cultural heart. Ethics are not set in stone and tend to be applied in a very contextual manner, which is paradoxical in light of the emphasis placed on universalism. Everything in France happens at least twice: once en théorie (or en principe) and once en pratique (or en réalité). Practical self-interest is important, and they tend to admire someone who can gain an advantage in a situation. Self-interest must be served, of course, but this should be done subtly, almost indirectly. Blatant self-interest and greed are seen as tactless, unsophisticated. Style counts; the way the result is obtained may be more important than the result itself, particularly if an individual displays a great deal of cleverness and panache. Telling the French that something is not allowed is a direct challenge to their ability to do it gracefully, finding an elegant way of bypassing the rules and not getting caught. Being able to do this well is a source of personal pride and satisfaction. Confrontation is not necessarily a loss of harmony in a group; rather, argument serves to move things along and prevent boredom and stagnation. Consensus is rarely an important goal. They disagree with an idea rather than with a person. What interests the French is not what people have in common, but their differences - vive la différence! Uniformity is dull; difference, exciting. Universalist en théorie and nonconformist en pratique. Everyone agrees with universalist principles. However, because of their strong feelings about individuality, the French tend to resist rigid procedures and look for a more personalized way of doing things. Establishing their unique character, not knuckling under to an anonymous system. Solidarity: a concern with national solidarity - sharing equally what is available rather than letting the strongest or most powerful get more than they need. At the same time, the French may display complete disregard for the welfare of those around them. Library books disappear and articles are torn out of magazines. That others might want to use these public resources seems not to matter; there is little sense of civic responsibility in relation to common property. Mission to Civilize. La Semeuse, the woman sowing grain: a symbol of the dissemination of French culture. Status and rank still count in this hierarchical culture: an aristocracy of educational degrees. unapologetically elitist. French people are experts at creating islands of psychological privacy in crowded public areas. Desire to keep one’s personal affairs private. Americans discard what is old and eagerly embrace the new. History has little bearing on everyday life. The past in France is immediate and important. It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of history to the average French person. The present is seen as the link between the past and the future; the future is the continuation of the past, so all three are inextricably interwoven. History, continuity, and tradition are critical. Change is not seen as intrinsically good. The benefits of the change must clearly outweigh the loss of security and continuity. The desire to show France’s independence from U.S. influence in thought and action is almost a reflex in most French politicians. Any description of a culture invokes an implicit comparison or contrast: compared with whom? Descriptions and stereotypes reveal at least as much about the describing culture as they do about the culture being described. Cultural values and behaviors are tendencies. While Pépé Le Pew teaches little Americans about the French, a cartoon cowboy called Lucky Luke teaches French children that Americans go for the “ready, fire, aim” approach as they shoot from the hip on their way across the wide-open spaces. Style - in dress, manners, conversation, and in presenting oneself: The French prefer a certain restraint, while Americans are more informal. In conversation French people prefer to make their points quite directly but in well-phrased, articulate arguments. The linguistic subtleties may be lost on Americans. American conversations are designed to impress. The listeners become an audience. French people feel that everyone should aspire to speak French. Any civilized, sophisticated, and educated person should possess this linguistic key to culture itself. Albert Camus elegantly expressed this notion in the famous quotation, “Ma patrie, c’est la langue française” (“My homeland is the French language”). One Frenchwoman’s impression of an American colleague: arrogant because he took up a lot of space! He sat opposite me and leaned on the chair in a very relaxed way. As we talked, he was so at ease! He seemed to have no doubt that building relationships with others is easy. He was so confident and so comfortable! That’s what made him come across as arrogant. In the U.S., informality is often appreciated and creates a relaxed and friendly “vibe” that shows we are accessible and transparent. Meeting someone new calls for a display of this kind of “solidarity politeness” to put the other person at ease by making it clear we see him or her as equal to us. A casual air of confidence can put others at ease and show we are trustworthy. It also conveys that we expect we’ll be able to get along with the new person just fine. French culture: “deference politeness.” Reserve, self-restraint, and formality show a degree of modesty since this type of behavior doesn’t assume we’ll get on famously. Informal behavior is associated with the private sphere of family and friends. The private and public spheres in France are more clearly separated, which means that by expressing formality and respecting protocol, you show you know your place is in the public sphere, not in the private one. An equal relationship is one where both parties do not assume that the other is “their friend” and maintain a respectful distance in the early stages. The French person, seeing American informality and casual confidence, can quickly see someone arriver en terrain conquis (arriving on conquered ground), saying in effect, “I own this place, and I own you.” Rodin’s The Thinker, a statue of a man sitting - and thinking. French society values thought and ideas for their own sake. They may or may not have any practical application, and either way is fine. French people tend to be more concerned with who they are, individually and socially, than with what they can do or what they have achieved. They think of themselves in terms of what school they went to, what position they occupy in a company, or what social level they have reached either by birth or by acceptance in a specific circle. A simple word or title often says it all, and people easily associate the person with the context and the meaning of that context. French individualism is expressed toward others in the sense that it tends to negate other people’s contributions or even their presence. I don’t care about the harmony of the group; my personal ideas are still more important and more valuable than the group making a decision. It is deeper than simple selfishness, French individualism negates the “Other.” Little can be gained from the Other, and one’s ideas or personal satisfaction remain more important Family and intimate friends are never considered Others. They are rather an extension of the self. Family ties and obligations of friendship must be honored and leave no room for the standard expressions of French individualism. American individualism does not negate the Other. Instead, it needs the Other in order to reinforce the self. Americans place a great deal of value in what Others have to say about them - a strong need to be liked and a tendency to avoid criticism. From a French perspective, American individualism appears closer to self-centeredness. The paradox between French solidarity and individualism can be summed up as follows: “On a personal level, I don’t care if my cigarette smoke irritates you, but I will hold up the other end of your protest banner as we march together against the government!” In France, people’s individual actions and struggles wouldn’t make them especially worthy of respect; they did not save any lives or work for the good of others and thus, in French eyes, did not achieve anything extraordinary. Being self-reliant means not just going along with the complexities of French society but also being able to use it to one’s advantage. A person with this capability is called débrouillard(e) - “resourceful.” Brouillard literally means “fog,” and une personne débrouillarde knows how to untangle things, where to go, or whom to reach to make things happen and avoid hassles. The typically French notion of débrouillardise refers especially to the ability to deal with complex situations and to find one’s own way out of the maze of red tape in French society. The French value personal honor and integrity above all. Honor refers both personal pride and to notions of individual dignity. Use the metaphor of a coconut and a peach to contrast French and American personalities. The coconut has a tough and not very appealing shell that contains pleasant meat and liquid within. The peach, on the other hand, is soft and inviting but has a hard core that is difficult or impossible to get into. French culture strongly emphasizes pudeur “self-restraint.” A certain degree of intimacy must be reached before a person can open up. Americans' cultural assumption is that in the end we have only ourselves to fall back on. French parents raise their children to be dependent on the family. The résidence secondaire (country home or apartment) plays an important family and social role in France. The importance of quality time to be spent with relatives and friends. French form the circle in social situations. No forming of little clusters, as often happens in informal discussions in the United States. By age ten, then, the French children have become bien élevés (well reared). They have learned about limits, boundaries, delineation, and appropriate behavior. They have learned control over themselves, over their bodies. They have acquired tremendous inner psychological independence. THE LANGUAGE OF FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE: in the U.S. they use the word friend to refer to someone they met yesterday or to someone they have known since childhood. The only distinction is between a “casual” friend and a “close” or “best” friend. French culture requires the most subtle of gradations: un(e) ami(e): a friend une connaissance: an acquaintance, someone you know superficially une relation: mainly a colleague or other professional contact un(e) camarade: a good pal from youth, school, university, or military service un copain (f. une copine): a buddy; etymologically someone you share bread with un(e) pote: like copain, but more familiar un(e) petit(e) ami(e): boyfriend or girlfriend; may be in a romantic sense depending on the context un(e) ami(e) d’enfance: a friend from childhood un(e) ami(e) de toujours: an always and forever friend un(e) meilleur(e) ami(e): best friend mon ami(e): normally means “my lover” but depends on the context un(e) cher(e) ami(e): a dear friend - more distant than a simple friend, oddly enough Neighborliness is not appreciated in France. A good French neighbor does not disturb others. American bonds that link friends do not necessarily go very deep. Friendship is not necessarily considered a major commitment. Friends in France operate according to the unspoken rule, “Say what you mean and mean what you say.” They expect promises to be followed up. The important thing [in a French conversation] is to establish ties, to create a network. We [French] create the fabric of our relationship in the same way and at the same time that we “make” conversation. For the French, their networks are what defines them. American cultural premise: “I exist outside all networks.” French friends do not seek to maintain harmony but rather to cultivate distinction and avoid boredom. They expect to disagree, to criticize, even to argue. The French find it tedious to always be in agreement and for this reason may be attracted to friends who are quite different from themselves. To comment honestly on their actions and choices: The bond between friends is not fragile and can stand up to this tension, even be strengthened and deepened by it. To make French friends, you would do well not to rush the process. Take your cue for pacing from your French acquaintance, and try not to “come on too strong” in the early stages. The explicit way in which Americans talk about their friendship sounds artificial to the French, almost like you are trying to convince them of something. French distinguish between relationships of friends and relationships of romantic and intimate partners. These categories do not overlap. Summarize the French attitude thus: “La pire des choses dans une relation homme-femme, c’est d’être camarades” (“The worst thing in a male-female relationship is to be friends”). Séduction is a vital component. Séduction in French means attracting by means of irresistible charm - playful, serious, or a combination. American boundaries between friendship and romance are fuzzy and do not provide an external definition for the relationship, the interaction between men and women must provide an internal one. Thus, the tone and pattern of their communication have to make it clear that they are “just friends.” The firmer French boundaries provide the external definition for the relationship, which gives freer play to the interaction between those involved. In the U.S., the first couple of dates are usually seen as a no-strings-attached trial period. In France, a woman who agrees to go out with a man is considered to be past that initial stage. She and the man have, in effect, agreed that they want to see more of each other. To see their leaders engaged in manual labor would be considered inappropriate and undignified. The French admiration for things intellectual corresponds to a devaluing of manual labor. The state plays such a central role in French life that politics is one of the most serious national preoccupations. Decisions made at the highest political levels can have an instant and significant effect on the daily routine of someone as distant as, for example, a farmer living near the Spanish border. For this reason, politics is more of an everyday affair in France. Every aspect of French economic and social life has some underlying political element. While laïque can be translated as “civil” or “secular”, laïcité (nominal form of laique) suggests a dedication to the values of reason, openness, and tolerance. In France, religion is virtually synonymous with Catholicism. French people tend to assume that nearly everyone is at least nominally a Catholic and may be quite taken aback when they find this is not so. For most of the French, Catholicism is simply a given. In fact, French Catholicism is more a matter of tradition than of faith, but anything else is considered marginal. Four regions: Brittany, Alsace, Basque, and Midi-Pyrénées, represent distinctive cultural entities. (Basque Country) is a single cultural unit that just happens to straddle an international border. Seven Basque provinces; four on the Spanish side, three on the French side: The French universalist attitude requires that everyone in a given situation, regardless of origins and particular circumstances, be treated exactly the same. France, with its traditional duty to spread its knowledge and civilization the world over while protecting its own borders from invasion, has never been culturally open to other populations. The inability of France to learn from other cultures is one of its most persistent ailments. Cultural minorities in France are acknowledged and respected only to the extent that they fit into the French social and cultural mold and do not disturb the social order. The magic word for success as an immigrant is assimilation. A law was passed in 2004 forbidding anyone to wear conspicuous signs of religious affiliation in public schools. The French Constitution forbids making any distinction among citizens based on race, origin, or religion. In this context, affirmative action laws, such as those in the United States, can be seen as a potential threat to the integrity of the nation. Similarly, the gender gap: French people tend to identify themselves as members of the same society and nation before asserting their gender differences. Feminist movements have received limited attention in France. Women are usually more concerned with who they are and with their femininity - what makes them womanly - than with demanding particular consideration because they are women. Universalism in France is based on a refusal to define a citizen by his or her particularity. Friends tend to be made at similar social levels, and descendants of aristocrats rarely mix socially with descendants of the wagon drivers who escorted them to the guillotine. Americans wishing to invite French colleagues from various levels to social functions should be aware of the reticence they are likely to encounter. The differences between the American and French legal systems: Legal judgment is rendered by trained judges rather than a jury composed of laypeople, and cases are determined according to written and codified law. Americans tend to think that people are basically good and that eventually bad people can turn their lives around and start again. The French traditionally believe that humanity is either evil or a mixture of good and evil and are convinced that people rarely change their basic orientation. These attitudes are pervasive in France and reinforce the belief of Americans - who in principle are inclined to trust people until they are proven untrustworthy - that the French are basically mistrustful or cynical. The French are so deeply pessimistic that some talk about taking vacations in the United States for a “breath of American optimism.” Although the word entrepreneur is French (a person who undertakes), entrepreneurship is not encouraged or nurtured by the French bureaucratic system or by the upbringing of French children. French parents do not suggest that their children make some pocket money mowing the neighbors’ lawns or shoveling their sidewalks. There is little possibility in France - compared with the United States - for becoming a wealthy, nationally recognized person through one’s own efforts. From the American perspective, turning in or reporting someone who is breaking the rules is usually seen as an action that helps the community as a whole. Post-World War II French behavior has been heavily influenced by the actions of the Vichy government, which cooperated with Nazi Germany. Many minority groups suffered as a consequence, and thousands of Jews and other populations were turned in and sent to concentration camps. This was one of the most shameful periods in French history, a period for which France is still paying a price, and it left a deep stigma in the French psyche. Attitudes toward denouncing people changed drastically - to the point that délation of almost any kind is considered bad and looked down upon. The French tend to assume - or at least to suspect - that turning someone in is an act of ill will. It is peculiarly American to see idealized images as actually achievable, the American belief that anyone can achieve anything with enough hard work and determination. American mantras such as “Practice makes perfect” and “If you believe and you can conceive, you will achieve” have no equivalent in the French language or culture. American thinking tends toward the dualistic and the absolutist - perfection itself is an absolute. Most Americans see things as either black or white, good or bad, right or wrong, a success or a failure. What this means is that if anything goes wrong in the quest to achieve the ideal, the entire enterprise becomes a failure. A nasty recurrent argument is enough to convince a couple that their marriage is in serious trouble. C’est Comme Ça; La Perfection N’est Pas de ce Monde (That’s the Way It Is; Perfection Exists Only in Heaven). The French ideal is seen as a goal to be aimed for but which cannot by its nature be achieved. The mismatch is simply acknowledged and accepted. People are expected to do their best and to achieve as much as they are capable of, but this capacity does not include perfection. The perfect grade of twenty points out of a possible twenty exists, at least en théorie, but en réalité, no one ever seriously expects to reach it. Accepting - perhaps even by enjoying - imperfection. What seems to interest the French is deviation from the ideal. Vive la différence! The French love of confrontational arguments, of making and valuing friends with whom one does not necessarily agree on important issues. The Clinton-Lewinsky affair: For the French, it was largely another amusing story of childish, prudish Americans getting in a tizzy. “We know politicians lie. We expect it. We also expect them to get on with their jobs.” Dominique Strauss-Kahn's confession of an affair has not derailed his successful career. The ideal American marriage: “Cheating on one’s wife or husband is unforgivable” French proverbial wisdom teaches that toute vérité n’est pas bonne à dire (all truths need not be spoken). American culture encourages people to “open up” about their problems. In France, silence is often the preferred way to address a problem. The expression mettre sous silence (to place under silence). Something is wrong and everyone in the family, for example, knows about it. Since they already know, they do not need to talk about it but simply live with the situation. In the U.S., a businessman shows his company’s financial statements but hides his mistress. In France, a businessman shows his mistress but hides the financial statements. Nouveau riche (“new rich” in literal translation, “crude rich” in cultural translation). Authority is an intricate part of French culture and history. French parents and schools provides the child with boundaries the teacher is the expert, so that knowledge flows essentially in one direction. The idea here is to develop an individual who has internalized the structure, discipline, restraint, and manners that are essential to living in society. French society is not built on a “Trust Default Mode.” French expats in the U.S. have told us of their amazement at the basic trust shown in everyday American life. They could hardly believe that parcels on people’s front porches weren’t stolen. Distrust society is a cautious society, win-lose: a society where living together ends up being a zero sum game, sometimes even a negative sum game (if you win, I lose); it is a society that sustains class struggle, unhappy living - both nationally and internationally - social jealousy, “closedness,” the aggression of mutual surveillance. Trust society is an expanding society, win-win, a society of solidarity, of common projects, of openness, exchange, communication. The French tendency to oppose - to oppose virtually everything. Opposition creates friction, discussion, debates, even fights, and possibly value, but generally hard-won value. The minority parties in the French parliament are called “opposition.” This term is a clear indication of an environment where those parties’ job is to fight and not to cooperate in the creation of a healthier society. Interculturalists use the “sunglasses” or “colored lens” analogy to explain how our worldview is filtered through the perspective of our deep culture. Before we are open and free to learn about another culture (and put on their sunglasses) we have to remove our own, so that our interpretation of the new culture will not be “colored” or filtered by our own values, attitudes, and beliefs. We are not here to judge another culture, but to learn about it. We need to develop “double vision” or the ability to see more than one side of an idea. Intellectual mastery of an issue is very important in France; results are what matter in the United States. In France, “Why” is always a very important question, and people love to argue and debate just for the sake of the enjoyment. Rational thought is the highest expression of French intelligence, and thinking about something rationally can be an end in itself. This brings us to René Descartes, as most discussions of French thinking inevitably do. Virtually all of Descartes’ scientific conclusions, reached without leaving the comfort of his study, were wrong, but it does not matter as long as the method was convincing. Descartes is the intellectual father of French preoccupation with form. Descartes' ideas correspond with three profoundly French characteristics: “the inability to learn from experience, the inability to tolerate contradiction, and the refusal to change one’s opinion in the face of a valid objection A general who devises a perfect battle plan with incomplete information about enemy capacity, and goes on to elegant defeat, is Cartesian. The Cartesian method requires that all elements of a problem and its solution be thoroughly mapped out before any action is taken. Intellectual mastery of the situation is what matters. Americans prefer to take action as quickly as possible and deal with details as they crop up. Americans pride themselves on their pragmatic approach to thinking about and solving problems. Despite their Cartesian passion for classification and definition, the French defy classification, even their own. French students learn to think through a problem using the “thesis-antithesis-synthesis” method. Presenting arguments in favor of the position, then by providing counterarguments. Finally, one integrates both arguments to determine which has the stronger claim. Presentations often begin with the theory, abstraction, and context of the problem and attendant issues show that the speaker has mastered the subject in all its complexity. Then the speaker essentially tries to poke holes in his or her own argument to show that all possibilities have been foreseen and addressed. This also demonstrates objectivity. Out of these emerges the best (most logical) conclusion. The point does not need to be hammered home, as the speaker assumes his or her audience is intelligent enough to get it by themselves. Americans do not work from theory. They value specifics, use these concrete examples to develop a theory or abstraction that accounts for the findings. Had Descartes been American, he would have risen from his desk, left his office, and gone out to look carefully at things before concluding anything about the nature of the world. In American thinking patterns, the shortest route to action must be the most efficient and the most practical, and therefore the best. Americans make decisions and implement them rapidly, making adjustments as they go. The French prefer to map things out completely before taking action. The shortest route may not be the most scenic one, and though it will get you to your destination quickly, you might miss something important along the way. Only when they have an intellectual control of all aspects of a plan do they feel confident enough to implement it. French individualism: going against basic principles of cooperation and consensus in favor of drastic and spectacular intervention. Whatever the circumstances, the French absolutely must throw in their two centimes worth. France’s often stubborn stance against American international policies acts as an essential counterweight to American hegemony. Americans like to think they stand for elevating humankind by advancing freedom and prosperity. The French feel culturally superior and destined to enlighten the globe. “Le français n’est plus une langue de pouvoir mais il pourrait être une langue de contre-pouvoir” (“French is no longer a language of power, but it could be a language of counterbalance”) Those who travel outside their own culture wear their country on their sleeve. When you arrive in a new country, you bring along “cultural baggage” - your own set of assumptions, values, beliefs, and certainties. They can be a heavy burden, slowing you down as you explore new territories. Try to empty the cultural baggage from your mental suitcase. See not only what you expected to see; also be open to anything and everything that comes your way. All experiences can be enriching. The tourist takes his culture with him; the traveler leaves his behind. To travel is to discover that everyone is wrong about other countries. To feel at home, stay at home. A foreign country is not designed to make you comfortable. It’s designed to make its own people comfortable. Those who like to feel they are always right should stay at home.","The absolute best book I've ever found on explaining the mindset of a country. (Runner-up is “Watching the English” by Kate Fox.) I wish every country had a book this deep. Not just what but why! Also appreciate the bold writing, skipping caveats."
The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck,Mark Manson,13262795,9,"The key to a good life is giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important. Wanting positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there. Everything worthwhile in life is won through surmounting the associated negative experience. Any attempt to escape it only backfires. Learn how to focus and prioritize your thoughts effectively - how to pick and choose what matters to you and what does not matter to you based on finely honed personal values. Say “fuck it” to everything unimportant in life. The point isn’t to get away from the shit. The point is to find the shit you enjoy dealing with. What most pampered people consider “life problems” are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about. Suffering is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. The emotional pain of rejection or failure teaches us how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next. Happiness comes from solving problems. To be happy we need something to solve. Solving problems is hard and often feels bad. Blame and denial give us a quick high: a way to temporarily escape our problems. Nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy. If you feel crappy it’s because your brain is telling you that there’s a problem that’s unaddressed or unresolved. Negative emotions are a call to action. Positive emotions, on the other hand, are rewards for taking the proper action. Just because something feels good doesn’t mean it is good. Just because something feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad. Emotions are merely signposts or suggestions. Make a habit of questioning them. People overidentify with their emotions. “I was really mad; I couldn’t help it.” Emotional intuition, without the aid of reason to keep it in line, sucks. Happiness requires struggle. It grows from problems. I was in love with the result, but I wasn’t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. The common cultural narratives would tell me that I gave up on my dream. The truth is, I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn’t. End of story. There’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past. The easier and more problem-free our lives become, the more we seem to feel entitled for them to get even better. Entitlement is linked to mass-media-driven exceptionalism. Exceptional information drives us to feel insecure, so we feel the need to compensate through entitlement and addiction, feel the need to be more extreme, more radical, and more self-assured to get noticed or even matter. Technology has solved old economic problems by giving us new psychological problems. If the worst thing you can be is in the middle of the bell curve, it then becomes better to be at the extreme low end, because at least there you’re still special and deserve attention: the most miserable, or the most oppressed, or the most victimized. The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so because they’re obsessed with improvement, which stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement. The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that’s okay. Acceptance of your own mundane existence will free you to accomplish what you truly wish to accomplish, without judgment or lofty expectations. Self-awareness is like an onion. There are multiple layers to it: The first layer is a simple understanding of one’s emotions. We all have blind spots. The second layer is an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions. Why do you feel angry? Is it because you failed to achieve some goal? Why do you feel lethargic and uninspired? Is it because you don’t think you’re good enough? Understand the root cause of the emotions that overwhelm you. The third layer is our personal values. Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me? If what we value is poorly chosen, then everything will be out of whack. Everything we think and feel about a situation ultimately comes back to how valuable we perceive it to be. In the long run, completing a marathon makes us happier than eating a chocolate cake. In retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful. Good values are 1) reality-based 2) socially constructive 3) immediate and controllable. Bad values are 1) superstitious 2) socially destructive 3) not immediate or controllable. The difference between a problem being painful or being powerful is a sense that we chose it, If you’re miserable in your current situation, it’s because you feel like some part of it is outside your control - that there’s a problem you have no ability to solve, a problem that was somehow thrust upon you without your choosing. William James decided to conduct a little experiment. Spend one year believing that he was 100 percent responsible for everything that occurred in his life, no matter what. During this period, he would do everything in his power to change his circumstances, no matter the likelihood of failure. James would later refer to his little experiment as his “rebirth,” and would credit it with everything that he later accomplished in his life. We are responsible for everything in our lives. We always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond. Fault is past tense. Responsibility is present tense. Fault results from choices that have already been made. Responsibility results from the choices you’re currently making, Outrage is like a lot of other things that feel good but over time devour us from the inside out. Change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. It really is that simple. It’s just not easy. Throughout my life, I’ve been flat-out wrong about myself, others, society, culture, the world, the universe - everything. And I hope that will continue to be the case for the rest of my life. When we learn we go from wrong to slightly less wrong, without actually ever reaching truth or perfection. Personal growth can actually be quite scientific. Our values are our hypotheses. Our actions are the experiments. The resulting emotions and thought patterns are our data. There is no correct ideology. There is only what your experience has shown you to be right for you. It’s easier to sit in a painful certainty that nobody would find you attractive, that nobody appreciates your talents, than to actually test those beliefs and find out for sure. Be in constant search of doubt: about beliefs, feelings, or the future. Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. People five hundred years from now will laugh at us and our certainties today. They, too, will be wrong. Just less wrong than we were. Uncertainty is the root of all progress and all growth. The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. That law applies to both good and bad. Making a million dollars, or becoming a famous rock star, could threaten your identity. “Finding yourself” can cement you into a strict role with unnecessary expectations, and close you off to potential and opportunities. Don’t find yourself. Never know who you are. Let go of the idea that “you” exist at all. Don’t be special. Don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Questions that will help you breed a little more uncertainty in your life: What if I’m wrong? What would it mean if I were wrong? Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem? It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. If it’s down to me being screwed up, or everybody else being screwed up, it is far, far, far more likely that I’m the one who’s screwed up. If it feels like it’s you versus the world, chances are it’s really just you versus yourself. A metric for the value “honesty,” is never completely finished; it’s a problem that must continuously be reengaged. “Buy a house and a nice car,” once achieved, has nothing left to give you. The problem that drove you your entire adult life was just taken away from you. Goals like buy a lake house, lose fifteen pounds - are limited in the amount of happiness they can produce in our lives. They may be helpful when pursuing quick, short-term benefits, but as guides for the overall trajectory of our life, they suck. (On advice:) She feels so stuck that she ends up emailing a stranger on the Internet (me) and asking him an obvious question. From the outside, the answer is simple: just shut up and do it. But from the inside, from the perspective of each of these people, these questions feel impossibly complex. The problem here is pain. Asking a tutor out on a date is as simple as saying the words; risking intense embarrassment and rejection feels far more complicated. If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head. The only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance in one’s life is through a rejection of alternatives, a narrowing of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or one person. Russian frankness is unadulterated expression. Honesty in the truest sense of the word. Communication with no conditions, no strings attached, no ulterior motive, no sales job, no desperate attempt to be liked. Travel shows you that another society can live with entirely different values and still function. To build trust you have to be honest. That means when things suck, you say so openly. There’s a certain level of joy and meaning that you reach in life only when you’ve spent decades investing in a single relationship, a single craft, a single career. And you cannot achieve those decades of investment without rejecting the alternatives. We are defined by what we choose to reject. The desire to avoid rejection at all costs, to avoid confrontation and conflict, is a deep valueless, pleasure-driven, and self-absorbed life. Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet not to celebrate romance, but rather to satirize it. The difference between a healthy and an unhealthy relationship comes down to two things: 1) how well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility 2) the willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner. It can be difficult for people to recognize the difference between doing something out of obligation and doing it voluntarily. So here’s a litmus test: Ask yourself, “If I refused, how would the relationship change?” Similarly, ask, “If my partner refused something I wanted, how would the relationship change?” If the refusal would cause a blowout your relationship is conditional - based on superficial benefits received from one another, rather than on unconditional acceptance of each other. When trust is destroyed, it can be rebuilt only if the following two steps happen: 1) the trust-breaker admits the true values that caused the breach and owns up to them 2) the trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved behavior over time. Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would. Breadth of experience is necessary and desirable to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in. But depth is where the gold is buried. Ernest Becker book The Denial of Death: All of human civilization, he says, is basically a result of immortality projects that allow our conceptual self to live on way past the point of our physical death. People declare themselves experts, entrepreneurs, inventors, innovators, mavericks, and coaches without any real-life experience, because they feel that they need to be great to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary.","The opposite of every other book. Don’t try. Give up. Be wrong. Lower your standards. Stop believing in yourself. Follow the pain. And oh yeah, kill yourself. Each point is profoundly true, useful, and more powerful than the usual positivity. Succinct but surprisingly deep, I read it in one night, then read it again a month later."
Ego Is the Enemy,Ryan Holiday,1591847818,9,"Ego = an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition. The need to be better than, more than, recognized for, far past any reasonable utility. That’s the definition this book will use. Ego is the enemy of what you want and of what you have. Ego is the enemy of mastering a craft. Ego is the enemy of real creative insight. Ego is the enemy of working well with others. Ego is the enemy of building loyalty and support. Ego is the enemy of longevity. Ego is the enemy of repeating and retaining your success. Building up our self-esteem, inspiring, encouraging, and assuring us that we can do whatever we set our minds to. In reality, this makes us weak. The ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible. Practice seeing yourself with a little distance. Get out of your own head. Detachment is a natural ego antidote. Though we think big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be action and education focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative. What a lot of us do when we’re scared or overwhelmed by a project: everything but focus on it. A man’s best treasure is a thrifty tongue. Talk depletes us. Talking and doing fight for the same resources. The greatest work and art comes from wrestling with the void, facing it instead of scrambling to make it go away. Ego crosses out what matters and replaces it with what doesn’t. It is not “Who do I want to be in life?” but “What is it that I want to accomplish in life?” The power of being a student is not just that it is an extended period of instruction, it also places the ego and ambition in someone else’s hands. There is a sort of ego ceiling imposed - one knows that he is not better than the “master” he apprentices under. Updating your appraisal of your talents in a downward direction is one of the most difficult things to do in life - but it is almost always a component of mastery. You can’t learn if you think you already know. The “bundle of energy” that our teachers and gurus have assured us is our most important asset. It is that burning, unquenchable desire to start or to achieve some vague, ambitious, and distant goal. This seemingly innocuous motivation is so far from the right track it hurts. They had passion and lacked something else. John Wooden saw those extra emotions as a burden. Instead, his philosophy was about being in control and doing your job and never being “passion’s slave.” No one would describe them as apathetic. They wouldn’t have said they were frenetic or zealous either. Opportunities are not usually deep, virgin pools that require courage and boldness to dive into, but instead are obscured, dusted over, blocked by various forms of resistance. What is really called for in these circumstances is clarity, deliberateness, and methodological determination. But too often, we proceed like this: A flash of inspiration: I want to do the best and biggest ______ ever. Be the youngest ______. The only one to ______. The “firstest with the mostest.” Breathlessness and impetuousness and franticness are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose and perseverance. Those who can tell you in great detail who they intend to become and when they intend to achieve it They can tell you all the things they’re going to do, or have even begun, but they cannot show you their progress. Because there rarely is any. What we require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose is about pursuing something outside yourself as opposed to pleasuring yourself. It’d be far better if you were intimidated by what lies ahead - humbled by its magnitude and determined to see it through regardless. He thrived on what was considered grunt work, asked for it and strove to become the best at precisely what others thought they were too good for. Greatness comes from humble beginnings; it comes from grunt work. It means you’re the least important person in the room - until you change that with results. Be lesser, do more. Those who have accomplished the greatest results are those who never lose self-control, but are always calm, self-possessed, patient, and polite. A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except thoughts, so he loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions. Plato spoke of the type of people who are guilty of feasting on their own thoughts. They assume that what they desire is available and proceed to arrange the rest, taking pleasure in thinking through everything they’ll do when they have what they want, thereby making their lazy souls even lazier. General George C. Marshall refused to keep a diary during World War II despite the requests of historians and friends. He worried that it would turn his quiet, reflective time into a sort of performance and self-deception. That he might second-guess difficult decisions out of concern for his reputation and future readers and warp his thinking based on how they would look. As long as you are looking down, on things and people; you cannot see something that is above you. Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first call promising. Vain men never hear anything but praise. What am I missing right now that a more humble person might see? That on which you so pride yourself will be your ruin. Is it ten thousand hours to mastery? It doesn’t matter. There is no end. Basketball player Bill Bradley would remind himself, “When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win.” As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance. The way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things. Keep your identity small. There is a real danger in any label that comes along with a career: are we suddenly a “filmmaker,” “writer,” “investor,” “entrepreneur,” or “executive” because we’ve accomplished one thing? We might think that success in the future is just the natural next part of the story - when really it’s rooted in work, creativity, persistence, and luck. Artists who think it was “inspiration” or “pain” that fueled their art and create an image around that - instead of hard work and sincere hustle - will eventually find themselves at the bottom of a bottle or on the wrong end of a needle. All of us regularly say yes unthinkingly, or out of vague attraction, or out of greed or vanity. Because we can’t say no - because we might miss out on something if we did. We think “yes” will let us accomplish more, when in reality it prevents exactly what we seek. All of us waste precious life doing things we don’t like, to prove ourselves to people we don’t respect, and to get things we don’t want. The Greek word euthymia is one we should think of often: it is the sense of our own path and how to stay on it without getting distracted by all the others that intersect it. Think about what’s truly important to you and then take steps to forsake the rest. Ego says that sure, even though you’re just starting to get the hang of one thing, why not jump right in the middle of another? The sense of certainty that got you here can become a liability if you’re not careful. You must fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you. If you want to live happy, live hidden. (About stock market:) We are at a wonderful ball. We know at some moment the black horsemen will come wreaking vengeance. Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking - what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands. The narcissistically inclined live in an unwalled city. A fragile sense of self is constantly under threat. There are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utilizing every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time. Which will it be? Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with. Systemic problems that felt too overwhelming to address. Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we’ve long needed to do. What matters to an active man is to do the right thing; whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him. Denial is your ego refusing to believe that what you don’t like could be true. Ego asks: Why is this happening to me? How do I save this and prove to everyone I’m as great as they think? It’s the animal fear of even the slightest sign of weakness. Any fool can learn from experience. The trick is to learn from other people’s experience. http://egoistheenemy.com/books/","Forget yourself and focus on the work. Be humble and persistent. Value discipline and results, not passion and confidence. Be lesser, do more. This message is crucial, but the opposite of almost every other book. I wish everyone would read this. I need to re-read it each year. It's that important. It's easy to read this and say “oh yeah I've got my ego under control”, but the problem is deeper than that."
Total Recall,Arnold Schwarzenegger,1410452107,9,"After the turmoil of the war, my parents’ big desire was for us to be stable and safe. We were growing up among men who felt like a bunch of losers. Their generation had started World War II and lost. My dad's answer to life was discipline. We had a strict routine that nothing could change: sports, exercises were added to the chores, and we had to earn our breakfast by doing sit-ups. In the afternoon, we’d finish our homework and chores, and my father would make us practice soccer no matter how bad the weather was. If we messed up on a play, we knew we’d get yelled at. My father believed just as strongly in training our brains. Visiting another village, maybe, or seeing a play. Then in the evening we had to write a report on our activities, ten pages at least. He’d hand back our papers with red ink scribbled all over them, and if we had spelled a word wrong, we had to copy it fifty times over. He had no patience with our problems. If we wanted a bicycle, he’d tell us to earn the money for it ourselves. I never felt that I was good enough, strong enough, smart enough. He let me know that there was always room for improvement. A lot of sons would have been crippled by his demands, but instead the discipline rubbed off on me. I turned it into drive. We were also supercompetitive the way brothers often are - always trying to outdo each other and win the favor of our dad. I was always on the lookout for ways to gain the advantage. I fought back my fear mainly because I had to prove that I was stronger. It was extremely important to show my parents I am brave. Somehow the thought took shape in my mind that America was where I belonged. Nothing more concrete than that. Just . . . America. I became absolutely convinced that I was special and meant for bigger things. I knew I would be the best at something - although I didn’t know what - and that it would make me famous. America was the most powerful country, so I would go there. The thought of going to America hit me like a revelation, and I really took it seriously. I’d talk about it. The kids got used to hearing me talk about it and thought I was weird, but that didn’t stop me from sharing my plans with everyone: my parents, my teachers, my neighbors. The idea of balancing the body and the mind was like a religion for him. “You have to build the ultimate physical machine but also the ultimate mind,” he would say. “Read Plato! The Greeks started the Olympics, but they also gave us the great philosophers, and you’ve got to take care of both.” Even though I appreciated the example of my father with the discipline and the things that he accomplished professionally, in sports, with the music, the very fact that he was my father took away from its significance for me. All of a sudden, I had a whole new life, and it was mine. What the article said: It gave Reg’s whole life story, from growing up poor in Leeds, England, to becoming Mr. Universe, getting invited to America as a champion bodybuilder, getting sent to Rome to star as Hercules, and marrying a beauty from South Africa, where he now lived when he wasn’t training on Muscle Beach. This story crystallized a new vision for me. I could become another Reg Park. All my dreams suddenly came together and made sense. I’d found the way to get to America: bodybuilding! And I’d found a way to get into movies. They would be the thing that everyone in the world would know me for. I refined this vision until it was very specific. I was going to go for the Mr. Universe title; I was going to break records in power lifting; I was going to Hollywood; I was going to be like Reg Park. The vision became so clear in my mind that I felt like it had to happen. There was no alternative; it was this or nothing. The deltoids were screaming from the unexpected sequence of sets. I’d shown them who was boss. Their only option now was to heal and grow. I never went to a competition to compete. I went to win. Even though I didn’t win every time, that was my mind-set. I became a total animal. If you tuned into my thoughts before a competition, you would hear something like: “I deserve that pedestal, I own it, and the sea ought to part for me. Just get out of the fucking way, I’m on a mission. So just step aside and gimme the trophy.” I pictured myself high up on the pedestal, trophy in hand. Everyone else would be standing below. And I would look down. I was already the favorite to win the 1967 Mr. Universe competition. But that didn’t feel like enough - I wanted to dominate totally. If I’d wowed them with my size and strength before, my plan now was to show up unbelievably bigger and stronger and really blow their minds. I learned the advantage of training early, before the day starts, when there are no other responsibilities and nobody else is asking anything of you. The limit I thought existed was purely psychological. Now that I’d seen someone doing a thousand pounds, I started making leaps in my training. It showed the power of mind over body. I thought more about my loss to Frank Zane. I could have found a way to train more even without access to equipment: I hadn’t done everything in my power to prepare. I decided, wouldn’t be an amateur ever again. Now the real game would begin. It’s human nature to work on the things that we are good at. It’s so satisfying. To be successful, however, you must be brutal with yourself and focus on the flaws. That’s when your eye, your honesty, and your ability to listen to others come in. I always wrote down my goals. It wasn’t sufficient just to tell myself “lose twenty pounds and learn better English and read a little bit more.” No. That was only a start. Now I had to make it very specific so that all those fine intentions were not just floating around. I would take out index cards and write that I was going to: • get twelve more units in college; • earn enough money to save $5,000; • work out five hours a day; • gain seven pounds of solid muscle weight; and • find an apartment building to buy and move into. Knowing exactly where I wanted to end up freed me totally to improvise how to get there. I always saw myself as a citizen of the world. Over the next two or three years, I did research. Every day I would look at the real estate section in the newspaper, studying the prices and reading the stories and ads. I got to where I knew every square block of Santa Monica. I knew how much the property values increased north of Olympic Boulevard versus north of Wilshire versus north of Sunset. I understood about schools and restaurants and proximity to the beach. I knew every building in town. I knew every transaction: who was selling, at what price, how much the property had appreciated since it last changed hands, what the financial sheet looked like, the cost of yearly upkeep, the interest rate on the financing. I met landlords and bankers. The math of real estate really spoke to me. I could tour a building, and as I walked through it, I would ask about the square footage, the vacancy factor, what it would cost per square foot to operate, and quickly calculate in my mind how many times the gross I could afford to offer and still be able to make the payments. Seeing me pull off a $215,000 deal left my old friend Artie Zeller in shock. For days afterward, he kept asking how I had the balls to do it. He could not understand because he never wanted any risk in his life. “How can you stand the pressure? You have the responsibility of renting out the other five units. You have to collect the rent. What if something goes wrong?” Problems were all he could see. It could be terrible. “Artie, you almost scared me just now.” I laughed. “Don’t tell me any more of this information. I like to always wander in like a puppy. I walk into a problem and then figure out what the problem really is. Don’t tell me ahead of time.” Often it’s easier to make a decision when you don’t know as much, because then you can’t overthink. If you know too much, it can freeze you. The whole deal looks like a minefield. I’d noticed the same thing at school. Our economics professor was a two-times PhD, but he pulled up in a Volkswagen Beetle. I’d had better cars for years by that time. I said to myself, “Knowing it all is not really the answer, because this guy is not making the money to have a bigger car. He should be driving a Mercedes.” “Just let me stumble into it,” I told them. “I don’t want to be forewarned.” You can overthink anything. There are always negatives. The more you know, the less you tend to do something. If I had known everything about real estate, movies, and bodybuilding, I wouldn’t have gone into them. I felt the same about marriage; I might not have done it if I’d known everything I’d have to go through. Lucy gave me advice about Hollywood. “Just remember, when they say, ‘No,’ you hear ‘Yes,’ and act accordingly. Someone says to you, ‘We can’t do this movie,’ you hug him and say, ‘Thank you for believing in me.’ ” I’d been bodybuilding for twelve years already, and the philosophy of the movie spoke to me. I liked the idea of staying hungry in life and never staying in one place. I wanted to be good enough at something else to be recognized again, and even bigger than before. They needed me to lose weight. First I had to redo myself mentally - let go of the 250-pound image of Mr. Olympia that was in my head. I started visualizing myself instead as lean and athletic. And all of a sudden what I saw in the mirror no longer fit. Seeing that helped kill my appetite for all the protein shakes and all the extra steak and chicken I was used to. I pictured myself as a runner rather than a lifter, and changed around my whole training regimen to emphasize running, bicycling, and swimming rather than weights. All through the winter, the pounds came off, and I was pleased. Hearing them talk about the need to disconnect and refresh the mind was like a revelation. “Arnold, you’re an idiot,” I told myself. “You spend all this time on your body, but you never think about your mind, how to make it sharper and relieve the stress. When you have muscle cramps, you have to do more stretching, take a Jacuzzi, put on the ice packs, take more minerals. So why aren’t you thinking that the mind also can have a problem? It’s overstressed, or it’s tired, it’s bored, it’s fatigued, it’s about to blow up - let’s learn tools for that.” They gave me a mantra and taught me to use a twenty-minute meditation session to get to a place where you don’t think. They taught how to disconnect the mind, so that you don’t hear the clock ticking in the background or people talking. If you can do this for even a few seconds, it already has a positive effect. The more you can prolong that period, the better it is. She was a normal person who wanted normal things, and there was nothing normal about me. My drive was not normal. My vision of where I wanted to go in life was not normal. The whole idea of a conventional existence was like Kryptonite to me. I knew the way my mind worked, and that to accomplish anything, I had to buy in completely. The goal had to be something that made total sense and that I could look forward to every day, not just something I was doing for money or some other arbitrary reason, because then it wouldn’t work. I got to know Nicholson, Beatty, and the rest of the Mulholland Drive. I was not inside enough to be partying with them all the time, but I did get exposed to how stars at that level lived and operated, what they were into, and how they moved around, and it inspired me to be there myself in a few years. Whoever represented me had to buy into the big vision. They wanted me to play a Nazi officer, a wrestler, a football player, a prisoner. I never took jobs like that because I would say to myself, “This isn’t going to convince anybody that you’re here to be a star.” But I felt that I was born to be a leading man. I had to be on the posters, I had to be the one carrying the movie. The only way you become a leading man is by treating yourself like a leading man and working your ass off. People of her caliber have the social skills to make it seem like they are very much aware of you and that they know a lot about what you are doing. The lawyer announced, “Dino doesn’t want to give you five points, like it says in the contract. He wants to give you no points.” I said, “Take the points. I’m in no position to negotiate. Because that’s not what I’m doing the movie for.” I understood the reality. The situation was lopsided. Dino had the money, and I needed the career, so it made no sense to argue. It was just supply and demand. But, I also thought, the day will come when the tables will turn, and Dino will have to pay. I felt like my movie career had suddenly come into sharp focus. The vision had always been there, but hazy: I never knew which direction it would go or how I was going to get the big break. But being chosen for Conan was like winning my first international bodybuilding title. Until then I could see my progress in the mirror, I could see my muscles slowly grow, but I really never knew where I stood. Then, after winning Mr. Universe, I thought, “Jesus, that was international judging, and I was competing against guys I see in the magazines, and I won. I’m going to succeed.” She told me instantly that the whole thing was a mistake. What’s your goal in doing this?” I had to admit I had no answer to that. I’d just been in a silly mood and said to Ara, “Let’s do something funny.” I wasn’t trying to get anything out of it. “Well, since there’s no goal and it’s not going to lead anywhere, kill it. You don’t need it. You had your fun, now move on.” She was wise about public perception because that was the world in which she’d grown up. Maria was the first girlfriend I ever had who didn’t treat my ambitions as an annoyance, some kind of madness that interfered with her vision of the future: namely, marriage, kids, and a cozy little house somewhere - and the stereotypical all-American life. Maria’s world wasn’t small like that. It was gigantic. I’d finally met a girl whose world was as big as mine. I’d reached some of my goals but a lot of my world was still a dream. And when I’d talk about even bigger dreams, she never said, “Come on, this can’t be done.” She’d seen it happen in her family. She understood why I had to get up at six in the morning to train for two hours, and she’d come with me to the gym. At dinner she’d see me about to dig into some ice cream, and she’d literally take it away. In politics, when disputes arise and camps form, you have to grasp what’s happening and move very quickly. She was right there with lightning-fast perceptions and really good advice. She talked to the right people and helped me avoid getting isolated or blindsided. She was a total animal. I saw myself as a businessman first. Very few actors like to sell. I’d seen the same thing with authors in the book business. The typical attitude seemed to be, “I don’t want to be a whore. I create; I don’t want to shill. I’m not into the money thing at all.” It was a real change when I showed up saying, “Let’s go everywhere, because this is good not only for me financially but also good for the public; they get to see a good movie!” I wanted to be involved in the meetings. I wanted everyone to see that I was working very hard to create a return on the studio’s investment. For me work just meant discovery and fun. If I heard somebody complaining, “Oh, I work so hard, I put in ten- and twelve-hour days,” I would crucify him. “What the fuck are you talking about, when the day is twenty-four hours? What else did you do?” I loved the variety in my life. One day I’d be in a meeting about developing an office building or a shopping center, trying to maximize the space. The next day I’d be talking to the publisher of my latest book about what photos needed to be in it. Next I’d be working with Joe Weider on a cover story. Then I’d be in meetings about a movie. Or I’d be in Austria talking politics with Fredi Gerstl and his friends. Everything I did could have been my hobby. It was my hobby, in a way. I was passionate about all of it. My definition of living is to have excitement always; that’s the difference between living and existing. I seldom saw my life as hectic. When I wanted to know more about business and politics, I used the same approach I did when I wanted to learn about acting: I got to know as many people as I could who were really good at it. I never like to cut things from my life, I only add. “Now that studios are coming to me,” I said to myself, “what if I go all out? Really work on the acting, really work on the stunts, really work on whatever else I need to be onscreen. Also market myself really well, market the movies well, promote them well, publicize them well. What if I shoot to become one of Hollywood’s top five leading men?” Because there was so little room at the top of the ladder, people got intimidated and felt more comfortable staying on the bottom of the ladder. But, in fact, the more people that think that, the more crowded the bottom of the ladder becomes! Don’t go where it’s crowded. Go where it’s empty. Even though it’s harder to get there, that’s where you belong and where there’s less competition. So there would be plenty of work - and plenty of opportunity to become as big a star as any of them. I wanted to be in the same league and on the same pay scale. As soon as I realized this, I felt a great sense of calm. Because I could see it. I’m always comparing life to a climb, not just because there’s struggle but also because I find at least as much joy in the climbing as in reaching the top. You should wait to marry until you are set financially and the toughest struggles of your career are behind you. Whenever I finished filming a movie, I felt my job was only half done. Every film had to be nurtured in the marketplace. You can have the greatest movie in the world, but if you don’t get it out there, if people don’t know about it, you have nothing. It’s the same with poetry, with painting, with writing, with inventions. It always blew my mind that some of the greatest artists, from Michelangelo to van Gogh, never sold much because they didn’t know how. They had to rely on some schmuck - some agent or manager or gallery owner - to do it for them. Picasso would go into a restaurant and do a drawing or paint a plate for a meal. Now you go to these restaurants in Madrid, and the Picassos are hanging on the walls, worth millions of dollars. That wasn’t going to happen to my movies. Same with bodybuilding, same with politics - no matter what I did in life, I was aware that you had to sell it. What we were proposing was an offbeat picture by three expensive guys. If each of us got paid his going rate, the budget would be so top-heavy that we thought no studio would touch it. And yet none of us wanted to take a pay cut because working for less can hurt your negotiating power in future deals. So when we pitched Tom Pollock, the head of Universal, we proposed to make Twins for no salary at all. Zero. What we wanted in exchange was a piece of the movie: a percentage of the box-office receipts, video sales and rentals, airline showings, and so on. I thought about what I had that those kids didn’t. I grew up poor too. But I had a fire inside of me to succeed and two parents who pushed me and taught me discipline. I had a strong public school education. I had after-school sports with coaches and training partners who were role models. I had mentors who told me, “You can do it, Arnold,” and then made me believe it. They were around me twenty-four hours a day, supporting me and making me grow. But how many inner-city kids had those tools? How many learned the discipline and determination? How many got the encouragement that would let them even glimpse their self-worth? Instead, they were told they were trapped. They could see that most of the adults around them were trapped. The most important thing was not how much you make, but how much you invest, how much you keep. I never wanted to join the long list of famous entertainers and athletes who wiped out financially. No matter what you do in life, you have to have a business mind and educate yourself about money. You can’t just delegate it to a manager. I wanted to know the details. My old motto: “Take one dollar and turn it into two.” I wanted big investments that were interesting, creative, and different. Conservative bets - the kind that would generate 4 percent a year, say - didn’t interest me. I could tolerate big risks in exchange for big returns, and I would want to know as much as possible about what was going on. As is so often the case, something that is impossible slowly becomes possible. I always told Ronda and Lynn, “Never share my calendar with anybody,” and I would tell Maria only a few days in advance. I’m a person who does not like to talk about things over and over. I make decisions very quickly, I don’t ask many people for opinions, and I don’t want to think too many times about the same thing. I want to move on. As a kid, as I learned about math, it all made sense. The decimals made immediate sense. The fractions made immediate sense. I knew all the roman numerals. You could throw problems at me, and I’d solve them. You could show me statistics, and instead of glazing over the way a lot of people do, I’d make out facts and trends that the figures were pointing to and read them like a story. I taught our kids math drills that my father had used on Meinhard and me. He always made us start them a month before school, and we had to do them every day because he felt that the brain has to be trained and warmed up like the body of an athlete. I’d gotten a college education while I was a bodybuilding champ. I’d married Maria in the middle of filming Predator. I’d made Kindergarten Cop and Terminator 2 and launched Planet Hollywood while I was the president’s fitness czar. I love it when people say that something can’t be done. That’s when I really get motivated; I like to prove them wrong. And I liked the idea of working on something bigger than me. California! It is the place where everyone in the world wants to go. You never hear anyone from abroad say, “Oh, I love America! I can’t wait to get to Iowa!” Or “Gosh, can you tell me about Utah?” Or “I hear Delaware is a great place.” California was wrapped in problems, but it was also heaven. Never follow the crowd. Go where it’s empty. When every immigrant I knew was saving up to buy a house, I bought an apartment building instead. When every aspiring actor was trying to land bit parts in movies, I held out to be a leading man. When every politician tries to work his or her way up from local office, I went straight for the governorship. It’s easier to stand out when you aim straight for the top. No matter what you do in life, selling is part of it. Don’t overthink. If you think all the time, the mind cannot relax. The key thing is to let both the mind and the body float. And then when you need to make a decision or hit a problem hard, you’re ready with all of your energy. By not analyzing everything, you get rid of all the garbage that loads you up and bogs you down. Turning off your mind is an art. It’s a form of meditation. Forget plan B. Think about the worst that can happen if you fail. How bad would it be? The day has twenty-four hours. I once gave a talk in a University of California: “as a student I’d trained five hours a day, gone to acting classes four hours a day, worked in construction several hours a day, and gone to college and done my homework. And I was not the only one.” We wrote down our training program each day. I always had the visual feedback of “Wow, an accomplishment. I did what I said I had to do. Now I will go for the next set, and the next set.” Writing out my goals became second nature, and so did the conviction that there are no shortcuts. Whether you’re doing a bicep curl in a chilly gym or talking to world leaders, there are no shortcuts - everything is reps, reps, reps. No matter what you do in life, it’s either reps or mileage. Today I hail the fact that I didn’t have anything that I wanted in Austria, because those were the very factors that made me hungry. Stay hungry. Be hungry for success, hungry to make your mark, hungry to be seen and to be heard and to have an effect. And as you move up and become successful, make sure also to be hungry for helping others. Don’t rest on your laurels. If you feel a desire to do more, then go all out.","I was not expecting to love this so much! I'm not a fan of his, but MAN his ambitious mindset, especially in his early days when he first moved to America, is so inspiring. Both on the movie-star side and real-estate side. If you need a role model or inspiration for thinking big, this is it. (Skip the final section on his governor days.) I was telling friends stories and thoughts about this book for weeks afterwards."
"Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now",Gordon Livingston,1569244197,9,"If the map doesn’t agree with the ground, the map is wrong. We are what we do. We are not what we think, or what we say, or how we feel. We are what we do. In judging other people, we need to pay attention not to what they promise but to how they behave. Past behavior is the most reliable predictor of future behavior. The three components of happiness are: * something to do * someone to love * something to look forward to We love someone when the importance of his or her needs and desires rises to the level of our own. It is difficult to remove by logic an idea not placed there by logic in the first place. We operate in the world mostly on autopilot, doing the same things today that didn’t work yesterday. Our children owe us nothing. Well-functioning families are good at letting their children go. Poorly functioning families tend to hold on to them. The statute of limitations has expired on most of our childhood traumas. My favorite therapeutic question is “What’s next?” It bypasses the self-pity implied in clinging to past traumas. I don’t have a clear idea of what people need to do to make themselves better. I am, however, able to sit with them while they figure it out. My job is to hold them to the task, point out connections I think I see between past and present, wonder about underlying motives. We are responsible for most of what happens to us. Any relationship is under the control of the person who cares the least. Feelings follow behavior. Most people know what is good for them, know what will make them feel better: exercise, hobbies, time with those they care about. They do not avoid these things because of ignorance of their value, but because they are no longer “motivated” to do them. They are waiting until they feel better. Frequently, it’s a long wait. Life’s two most important questions are “Why?” and “Why not?” The trick is knowing which one to ask. Happiness is the ultimate risk. There might be advantages to their being depressed. It is a safe position. Asking someone to relinquish depression is often met with resistance. To be happy is to take the risk of losing that happiness. When confronted with a suicidal person I seldom try to talk them out of it. Instead I ask them to examine what it is that has so far dissuaded them from killing themselves. People in despair are, naturally, intensely self-absorbed. Suicide is the ultimate expression of this preoccupation with self. When people fall in love, no justification for their attachment is necessary. When people fall out of love, the demands for an explanation are insistent: What happened? Who’s at fault? Why couldn’t you work it out? “We didn’t love each other anymore” is not, in most cases, a sufficient response. Only bad things happen quickly. All the happiness-producing processes in our lives take time, usually a long time: learning new things, changing old behaviors, building satisfying relationships, raising children. This is why patience and determination are among life’s primary virtues. Nearly every human action is in some way an expression of how we think about ourselves. Nothing is so beautiful as a promise, right after it is given. Lying to ourselves disables us entirely from making needed changes. A conviction that there exists somewhere the person who will save us with his or her love. Much of the infidelity that is the hallmark of unhappy marriages rests on this illusion. The word “closure,” with its comforting implications that grief is a time-limited process from which we all recover. Some part of my heart had been cut out and buried. What was left? Now there was a question worth contemplating. It is our task to transfer that love to those who still need us. Nobody likes to be told what to do. Much of what passes for intimate communication involves admonitions and instructions. I ask people in conflict to withhold criticism of those around them to see if this changes the atmosphere. It is amazing how radical this suggestion seems. Awfulizing: the idea that any relaxation in standards or vigilance is the first step toward failure, degradation, and the collapse of civilization as we know it. The conflicts that arise between parents and children are skirmishes in a long-term power struggle based on the faulty assumption that the primary task of parenthood is to shape the behavior of children through incessant instruction. Rules and punishments produce oppositional children who grow into oppositional adults. Since judgmental people were generally raised in judgmental families, they find it hard to envision another way of interacting with those they live with. It is always easier to keep doing what we’re used to, even if it’s evidently not working for us. It is possible to live without criticizing and directing everyone around us. The primary goal of parenting, beyond keeping our children safe and loved, is to convey to them a sense that it is possible to be happy in an uncertain world, to give them hope. Do this by example. Demonstrate qualities of commitment, determination, and optimism. The major advantage of illness is that it provides relief from responsibility. Behavior that is reinforced will continue; behavior that is not will extinguish. It is just hard sometimes to discern what that reinforcement might be. We are, when sick, told to “take it easy.” The longer someone is disabled, the greater the chance that the illness will become a part of a person’s identity. Surgery & drugs have contributed to the sense that healing is something that happens to us rather than something in which we are active participants, inducing a kind of passivity in those afflicted. One of the things that define us is what we worry about. A “misfortune fund” that could be used to compensate people facing extraordinary expenses that were no one’s fault (e.g., parents of children born with disabling abnormalities, victims of crime or natural disasters). Surely this would be fairer and more compassionate than enriching a few winners in the litigation lottery. Such a system would reinforce the belief that we all share in the inevitable uncertainties and risks that are a part of life. Threats must be identified realistically in our personal lives as well. Much of what we do is driven by fear of failure. The pursuit of material wealth distracts us from activities and people that provide more lasting pleasure and satisfaction. There are no more powerful desires than the pursuit of happiness and the struggle for self-respect. If means can be found that move people in these directions: better jobs, education, the chance to improve one’s life, and a sense of fairness and opportunity, the seductive and short-lived bliss provided by drugs will lose its appeal. Parents have a limited ability to shape children’s behavior, except for the worse. To imagine that we are solely, or even primarily, responsible for the successes and failures of our children is a narcissistic myth. You seldom see a bumper sticker that reads, MY KID IS IN REHAB. Parents can try to teach the values and behaviors that they have found to be important, but it is the way we live as adults that conveys the real message to our children about what we believe in. Whether they choose to integrate these values into their own lives is up to them. Kids have a keen nose for hypocrisy. Anxiety is contagious. Children sense it in their parents and are affected by it. Given love and support, most children grow into happy, productive adults independent of whatever theory of parenting they were raised with. Set reasonable limits on children’s behavior. Provoke less confrontation and resentment. Most of the debilitating struggles within families that drain the happiness of all concerned and lead to destructive power struggles flow from an obsessive need for control on the parents’ part and an anxious sense that their direction is all that stands between their children and a life of crime. When parents are preoccupied with unimportant issues like food consumption and room cleanliness, these will be arenas for endless conflict. Children raised in homes where parental control is severe turn out to have a poor set of internalized limits because they have experienced only rigid external rules. Conversely, in families where there are few constraints children do not have a way to learn those guidelines necessary to live comfortably with others. Our primary task as parents is to convey to them a sense of the world as an imperfect place in which it is possible, nevertheless, to be happy. “What can I do to make sure this kid turns out well?” Not much, but maybe cutting down on the fights and not trying to control your child’s every decision might help to make everyone happier right now. Enjoy life even as we are surrounded by evidence of its brevity and potential for disaster. Focus our awareness and energy on those things and people that bring us pleasure. Memory is not an accurate transcription of past experience. Rather it is a story we tell ourselves about the past, full of distortions, wishful thinking, and unfulfilled dreams. The problem with longing for paradises is that it distracts us from our efforts to extract pleasure and meaning from the present. When we visit our childhood homes, we are commonly amazed at how much smaller they seem. When Russell Baker first submitted the memoir of his youth, Growing Up, it was rejected by a publisher as uninteresting. He then told his wife, “I am going upstairs to invent the story of my life.” The result was a best seller - and no less true than the original version. Of all the forms of courage, the ability to laugh is the most profoundly therapeutic. Mental health is a function of choice. The more choices we are able to exercise, the happier we are likely to be. The primary variable in this regard is tolerance of risk. If we take counsel of our fears, particularly our fear of change, it is hard to choose a life that makes us happy. Is it anxiety or lack of imagination that restricts us? Life can be seen as a series of relinquishments, rehearsals for the final act of letting go of our earthly selves. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves. If every misfortune can be blamed on someone else, we are relieved of the difficult task of examining our own contributory behavior or just accepting the reality that life is and has always been full of adversity. Most of all, by placing responsibility outside ourselves we miss out on the healing knowledge that what happens to us is not nearly as important as the attitude we adopt in response.

This exercise should be incorporated into every written will: “And for my epitaph I would like the following:”",Powerful and profound life lessons from a psychiatrist who's been listening to people's problems for decades.
Zero to One,Peter Thiel and Blake Masters,0804139296,9,"Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. We are going to need miracles. We call these miracles technology. It allows us to do more with less, find value in unexpected places. The future will be a time when the world looks different from today. Most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more. A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. A new company’s most important strength is new thinking. What a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch. Four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today: 1. Make incremental advances 2. Stay lean and flexible 3. Improve on the competition 4. Focus on product, not sales Yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product. How much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? What valuable company is nobody building? Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create. By “monopoly,” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example. 95% of Google’s revenue comes from search advertising. Framing itself as just another tech company allows Google to escape all sorts of unwanted attention. Entrepreneurs understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition. When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different. You’ll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that’s true. In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t. Only monopoly profits allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival. All happy companies earn a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business. Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival. The more we compete, the less we gain. The hazards of imitative competition may partially explain why individuals with an Asperger’s-like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon Valley today. If you’re less sensitive to social cues, you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you. Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have. Proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. Successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all. Every startup should start with a very small market. Reach a few thousand people who really needed your product. The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors. It’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market. Don’t disrupt: avoid competition. First mover advantage? It’s much better to be the last mover. Make the last great development in a specific market and enjoy years of monopoly profits. Study the endgame before everything else. Whether success comes from luck or skill: Is there a way to settle this debate objectively? Unfortunately not, because statistics doesn’t work when the sample size is one. You can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it. You can also expect the future to be either better or worse than the present. Optimists welcome the future; pessimists fear it. Combining these possibilities yields four views: INDEFINITE PESSIMISM This describes Europe. An indefinite pessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no idea what to do about it. All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe’s famous vacation mania. DEFINITE PESSIMISM A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he must prepare for it. Chinese leadership is obsessed with the way in which things threaten to get worse. Every class of people in China takes the future deadly seriously. DEFINITE OPTIMISM To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it better. INDEFINITE OPTIMISM To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. Baby Boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to effortless progress that they feel entitled to it. While a DEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC future would need engineers to design underwater cities and settlements in space, an INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC future calls for more bankers and lawyers. Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth. DEFINITE OPTIMISM works when you build the future you envision. DEFINITE PESSIMISM works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new. INDEFINITE PESSIMISM works because it’s self-fulfilling: if you’re a slacker with low expectations, they’ll probably be met. But INDEFINITE OPTIMISM seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it? Evolution. Would-be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in advance: we’re supposed to listen to what customers say they want, make nothing more than a “minimum viable product,” and iterate our way to success. But leanness is a methodology, not a goal. We have to find our way back to a definite future. A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. Once you think that you’re playing the lottery, you’ve already psychologically prepared yourself to lose. Every individual is unavoidably an investor, too. When you choose a career, you act on your belief that the kind of work you do will be valuable decades from now. Life is not a portfolio. Any individual cannot “diversify” herself by keeping dozens of equally possible careers in ready reserve. Our schools teach the opposite: “It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do it well.” That is completely false. It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future. Too many people are starting their own companies today. People who understand the power law will hesitate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture: they know how tremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company while it’s growing fast. You could have 100% of the equity if you fully fund your own venture, but if it fails you’ll have 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google, by contrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35 million now.) Our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on? Contrarian thinking doesn’t make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up. The business version of our contrarian question: What valuable company is nobody building? Every correct answer is necessarily a secret. Something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. Consider the urban hipsterdom: the handlebar mustache, and vinyl record players all hark back to an earlier time when people were still optimistic about the future. If everything worth doing has already been done, you may as well feign an allergy to achievement and become a barista. There are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. - Natural secrets study some undiscovered aspect of the physical world. - Secrets about people are things that people don’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to know. What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo? Consider the monopoly secret again: competition and capitalism are opposites. Ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say? Are there any fields that matter but haven’t been standardized and institutionalized? Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it’s rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything that you know. So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there’s always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody - and that’s a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator. Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together. A company does better the less it pays the CEO. The founding moment of a company: set the rules that will align people toward the creation of value in the future. “Company culture” doesn’t exist apart from the company itself. A startup is a team of people on a mission. Recruiting is a core competency for any company. It should never be outsourced. You’ll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling, why you’re doing something important that no one else is going to get done. You should be able to explain why your company is a unique match for him personally. And if you can’t do that, he’s probably not the right match. Make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Defining roles reduces conflict. Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities. Like acting, sales works best when hidden. People who sell advertising are called “account executives.” People who sell customers work in “business development.” The most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it. If you’ve invented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you have a bad business - no matter how good the product. Selling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone else. Computers are complements for humans, not substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete. Computers can find patterns that elude humans, but actionable insights can only come from a human analyst. How can computers help humans solve hard problems? Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn’t stop us from making definite plans today. The seven questions that every business must answer: 1. The Engineering Question Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements? 2. The Timing Question Is now the right time to start your particular business? 3. The Monopoly Question Are you starting with a big share of a small market? 4. The People Question Do you have the right team? 5. The Distribution Question Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product? 6. The Durability Question Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? 7. The Secret Question Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see? Any great business plan must address every one of them. If you don’t have good answers to these questions, you’ll run into lots of “bad luck”. If something is “socially good,” is it good for society, or merely seen as good by society? Whatever is good enough to receive applause from all audiences can only be conventional. Doing something different is what’s truly good for society. The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve. An entrepreneur can’t benefit from macro-scale insight unless his own plans begin at the micro-scale. No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company. The single greatest danger for a founder is to become so certain of his own myth that he loses his mind. But an equally insidious danger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for wisdom.","Brilliant, bold, and clear thoughts about how to make a big Silicon Valley size company.

"Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches",Marvin Harris,0679724680,9,"This book is about the causes of apparently irrational and inexplicable lifestyles. I have deliberately chosen bizarre and controversial cases that seem like insoluble riddles. ""Only God knows"" : The long-term practical effect of this suggestion has been to discourage the search for other kinds of explanations. For one thing is clear: If you don’t believe that a puzzle has an answer, you’ll never find it. We don’t expect lifestyle participants to be able to explain their lifestyles. Art and politics fashion that collective dreamwork whose function it is to prevent people from understanding what their social life is all about. Everyday consciousness, therefore, cannot explain itself. Ignorance, fear, and conflict are the basic elements of everyday consciousness: * Ignorance: Most people achieve awareness of only a small portion of the range of lifestyle alternatives. * Fear: Against events like growing old and dying, * Conflict: Some persons invariably control or exploit others. These inequalities are as much disguised, mystified, and lied about as old age and death. == COW: Cow love contributes to the adaptive resilience of the human population by preserving temporarily dry or barren but still useful animals; by discouraging the growth of an energy-expensive beef industry; by protecting cattle that fatten in the public domain or at landlord’s expense; and by preserving the recovery potential of the cattle population during droughts and famines. The alternative is to destroy the present system and replace it with a completely new set of demographic, technological, politico-economic, and ideological relationships—a whole new ecosystem. Hinduism is undoubtedly a conservative force, But if you think that a high-energy industrial and agribusiness complex will necessarily be more “rational” or “efficient” than the system that now exists, forget it. == PIG: The pig can convert grains and tubers into high-grade fats and protein more efficiently than any other animal. Pig farming was a threat to the integrity of the basic cultural and natural ecosystems of the Middle East. The greater the temptation, the greater the need for divine interdiction. This is why the gods are always so interested in combating sexual temptations. == WAR: Since war has deadly consequences for its participants, it seems presumptuous to doubt that the combatants know why they are fighting. But cows, pigs, wars, or witches, the answers to our riddles do not lie within the participants’ consciousness. The belligerents themselves seldom grasp the systemic causes and consequences of their battles. They tend to explain war by describing the personal feelings and motivations experienced immediately prior to the outbreak of hostilities. These are the results rather than the causes of war. Primitive war, like cow love or pig hate, has a practical basis. Primitive warfare is neither capricious nor instinctive; it is simply one of the cutoff mechanisms that help to keep human populations in a state of ecological equilibrium with respect to their habitats. In strictly biological terms, females are more valuable than males. Warfare inverts the relative value of the contribution made by males and females to a group’s prospects for survival. By placing a premium upon maximizing the number of combat-ready adult males, warfare obliges primitive societies to limit their nurturance of females. It is this, and not combat per se, that makes warfare an effective means of controlling population growth. In our own times, only an incredible degree of self-righteous pigheadedness prevents us from admitting that infanticide is still being practiced on a cosmic scale in the underdeveloped nations, where first-year infant mortality rates of 250 per 1,000 births are commonplace. To sum it all up, war is the price that primitive societies pay for raising sons when they cannot afford to rear daughters. Our primary mode of biological adaptation is culture, not anatomy. I no more expect men to dominate women simply because they are taller and heavier, than I expect the human species to be ruled over by cattle or horses—animals that outweigh the average husband by an amount thirty times greater than he outweighs his wife. If I had knowledge only of the anatomy and cultural capacities of men and women, I would predict that women rather than men would be more likely to gain control. If one sex were going to subordinate the other, it would be female over male. Females have control over the birth, care, and feeding of babies. Women, because they control the nursery, can potentially modify any lifestyle that threatens them. It is within their power of selective neglect to produce a sex ratio heavily in favor of females over males. It also lies within woman’s power to sabotage the development of “masculine” males by rewarding little boys for being passive rather than aggressive. I would expect women to concentrate their efforts on rearing solidary and aggressive females rather than males. I would further expect the few male survivors per generation to be shy, obedient, hardworking, and grateful for sexual favors. I would predict that women would monopolize the headship of local groups, that they would be responsible for shamanistic relations with the supernatural, and that God would be called SHE. Finally, I would expect that the ideal and most prestigious form of marriage would be polyandry—one woman controlling the sexual and economic services of several men. There is one thing wrong with this theory: No one has ever been able to authenticate a single case that is representative of true matriarchy. Chagnon says that they split up and move so often because they fight over women and are always at war. I suggest that it is more nearly correct to say that they fight over women and are always at war because they move so often. Nomadic way of life protected them from the white man’s guns and diseases. These villages compete for the same scarce resource, and that resource is not women but protein. Since the typical Yanomamo village is less than a day’s walk from its nearest neighbor, extended expeditions inevitably cross and recross hunting territories that are used by villages other than one’s own. The practical and mundane reason for the systematic killing and neglect of more female than male children can’t be simply that the men force the women to do it. Their own interest is in raising more boys than girls. This interest is rooted in the fact that there are already too many Yanomamo in relation to their ability to exploit their habitat. A higher ratio of men to women means more protein per capita (because men are the hunters) and a slower rate of population growth. == BIG MAN: American Indians who formerly inhabited the coastal regions of Southern Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington practiced conspicuous waste known as potlatch. The object was to give away or destroy more wealth than one’s rival. Shame his rivals and gain everlasting admiration from his followers by destroying food, clothing, and money. Sometimes he might even seek prestige by burning down his own house. The giver of the feast takes the bones and the stale cakes; the meat and the fat go to the others. The big men work harder, worry more, and consume less than anybody else. Prestige is their only reward. As a result of the big man’s craving for status, more people work harder and produce more food and other valuables. Competitive feasting serves the practical function of preventing the labor force from falling back to levels of productivity that offer no margin of safety. To transfer food and other valuables from centers of high productivity to less fortunate villages. Everything about reciprocity is opposed to precise counting and reckoning of what one person owes to another. In fact, the whole idea is to deny that anybody really owes anything. One can tell if a lifestyle is based on reciprocity or something eke by whether or not people say thank you. In truly egalitarian societies, it is rude to be openly grateful for the receipt of material goods or services. The Semai: to say thank you was very rude because it suggested either that you were calculating the size of the piece of meat you had been given, or that you were surprised by the success and generosity of the hunter. Gifts make slaves just as whips make dogs. The highest prestige falls to the quietly dependable hunter who never boasts about his achievements and who avoids any hint that he is giving a gift when he divides up an animal he has killed. During the early years of capitalism, highest prestige went to those who were richest but lived most frugally. After their fortunes had become more secure, the capitalist upper class resorted to grand-scale conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste in order to impress their rivals. Meanwhile, the middle and lower classes continued to award highest prestige to those who worked hardest, spent least, and soberly resisted all forms of conspicuous consumption. Advertising induces the middle and lower classes to stop saving and to buy, consume, waste. And so among middle-class status seekers, highest prestige now goes to the biggest and most conspicuous consumer. But in the meantime, the rich found themselves threatened by new forms of taxation aimed at redistributing their wealth. Conspicuous consumption in the grand manner became dangerous, so highest prestige now once again goes to those who have most but show least. With the most prestigious members of the upper class no longer flaunting their wealth, some of the pressure on the middle class to engage in conspicuous consumption has also been removed. == CARGO CULT: Phantom Cargo: Waiting for ships or planes to bring dead ancestors and cargo began a long time ago. Waiting for a total upgrading of their lives. They insisted on making the Europeans act like true big men; they insisted that those who possessed wealth were under the obligation to give it away. Without the cheapness of native labor and the expropriation of native lands, the colonial powers would never have gotten so rich. In one sense, therefore, the natives were entitled to the products of the industrialized nations even though they couldn’t pay for them. Cargo was their way of saying this. And that, I believe, is its true secret. == JESUS: Any description of the political and military events in Palestine during the first century A.D. has to be based largely upon the writings of one of the great historians of the ancient world, Flavius Josephus. Writing in Rome for Roman readers—many of whom, including the emperor, were eyewitnesses to the events described—Josephus was unlikely to have fabricated the basic facts of his history. In the aftermath of the unsuccessful messianic war, it quickly became a practical necessity to deny that their cult had arisen out of the Jewish belief in a messiah who was going to topple the Roman Empire. == WITCHES: Ask not why the inquisitors were obsessed with destroying witchcraft, but rather why they were so obsessed with creating it. The inevitable effect of the inquisitorial system was to make witchcraft more believable, and hence to increase the number of witchcraft accusations. The witch-hunt system was too well designed, too enduring. It could only have been sustained by interests that were equally enduring, grim, and stubborn. The witchcraft system and the witch craze had practical and mundane uses apart from the stated goals of the witch hunters. The best way to understand the cause of the witch mania is to examine its earthly results rather than its heavenly intentions. The principal result of the witch-hunt was that the poor came to believe that they were being victimized by witches and devils instead of princes and popes. Did your roof leak, your cow abort, your oats wither, your wine go sour, your head ache, your baby die? It was a neighbor, the one who broke your fence, owed you money, or wanted your land—a neighbor turned witch. Did the price of bread go up, taxes soar, wages fall, jobs grow scarce? It was the work of the witches. Did plague and famine carry off a third of the inhabitants of every village and town? The diabolical, infernal witches were growing bolder all the time. 82 percent of the witches were females. Defenseless old women and lower-class midwives were usually the first to be accused in any local outbreak. Doctors, lawyers, and university professors were seldom threatened. Only three instances of accusations of witchcraft against members of the nobility, and not one of those so accused was executed. Witch mania was an integral part of the defense of that institutional structure. This can best be seen by comparing the witch mania with its contemporary antithesis, military messianism. The witchcraft mania made everyone feel helpless and dependent on the governing classes, gave everyone’s anger and frustration a purely local focus.","Mind-blowing anthropology. Great argument that the reasons that religions worship cows or hate pigs, that tribes wage wars, or Europe's 200 years of witch hunts, are all very practical economic reasons usually unknown to the participants or washed out of history. But they're revealed here in zoomed-out hindsight. My notes here can't describe it. You have to read the whole book. Riveting."
The Truth,Neil Strauss,0060898763,9,"What it means to tell the truth: It is to give someone else her freedom, to allow her to have a reaction even if it leads to negative consequences for you, to give her the voice that lying takes away. When you meet someone and feel like it’s love at first sight, run in the other direction. All that’s happened is that your dysfunction has meshed with their dysfunction. The things that we’re the most resistant to are precisely what we need. And the things we’re most scared to let go of are exactly the ones we most need to relinquish. Lying is about controlling someone else’s reality, hoping that what they don’t know won’t hurt you. Intimacy is sharing your reality with someone else and knowing you’re safe, and them being able to share their reality with you and also be safe. Addiction: If you grew up feeling unwanted by or unimportant to a parent, this is a sign that neglect likely occurred: This creates wounded children, who are often depressed and indecisive, see themselves as flawed and less valuable than others, and feel they can’t face the world alone. In relationships, they tend to have what’s called anxious attachment. They may feel like they’re not enough for their partners; become so wrapped up in their relationships that they lose sight of their own needs and self-worth. A healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a relationship and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the relationship and the relationship nurtures them. But they’re not overly dependent or independent: They are interdependent, which means that they take care of the majority of their needs and wants on their own, but when they can’t, they’re not afraid to ask their partner for help. Only when our love for someone exceeds our need for them do we have a shot at a genuine relationship together. Tell my eight-year-old self that I’m firing his parents - and that from now on I’m taking care of him. To be free: It’s the one feeling I never had growing up. Anything that doesn’t bring you alive is too small for you. For most men, what’s tougher than breaking up is the moment when their ex finally falls out of love with them and lets go, perhaps because it triggers a childhood fear - a psychological terror - of losing the first woman whose love they needed: their mother. Seeing the person you love with someone else is the height of passion. “Yeah, but usually the passion it ignites in people is murderous.” That’s the point: It’s something that’s hard to deal with. And normally you would feel jealousy and anger. But if you can control it… Theoretical nonmonogamy, which is when two people say they’re in an open relationship - but instead of actually sleeping with other people, they just get to feel free knowing they have the option to do so. Any good Jungian therapist will tell you, you’re not supposed to repress the shadow in the first place. That’s when bad things happen. The goal is to integrate it. In life, whoever has the strongest reality wins. Lose your moral certainty and lose the ground you stand on. It’s not society that holds us back, it’s ourselves. We just blame society because not only is it easier but it’s a nearly impossible weight to move. This way, we don’t actually have to change. I used to think that a good relationship meant always getting along. But the secret, I realize, is that when one person shuts down or throws a fit, the other needs to stay in the adult ego state. If both people descend to the wounded child or adapted adolescent, that’s when all the forces of relationship drama and destruction are unleashed. As long as at least one partner is in the adult functional at any given time, most - if not all - arguments can be avoided. The person in a relationship with the least amount of comfort does get to set the boundaries - even if she keeps changing the rules. You can’t force a relationship to happen. You just have to make a space in your heart for one, then let go of all expectations, agendas, and control. The positive side of rules: They provide clear, fixed boundaries that keep us feeling safe. “How have you been treating yourself?” It’s the perfect therapist greeting: one with a message. It is not about what’s happening or what’s new or how life’s treating me. Become a scientist of your own lows. If you’re in pain of the heart, enter into the pain and try to find its source rather than letting the pain drive you, or trying to escape from it or overcome it. The only relationship that’s truly a failure is one that lasts longer than it should. Addiction is something that hurts your life and spirit, that gets progressively worse, and that you can’t stop doing even though you know it’s not good for you? “I just realized that you’re a marriage addict.” Managing feelings is like taming lions. No matter how successful you think you are, they’re still ultimately in control. Let yourself be emptied out and deal with whatever comes up in the process. People do lemon juice and cayenne pepper diets to clean out their insides, so why not a cleanse for the psyche? Then I can start consuming healthy thoughts and experiences. Once your desires are fulfilled in your imagination, the need to live them out in real life suddenly doesn’t seem so urgent. So if you could design the perfect relationship for yourself, what would it be? I made a mistake by equating variety with freedom. I’m off all social and dating apps and websites. That’s freedom. Less than twenty people have my email address. That’s freedom. My phone barely makes a sound. That’s freedom. Each day, I try to take care of the six core needs: 1. physical, by surfing and eating healthily 2. emotional, by allowing myself to experience and express feelings 3. social, by spending time with growth-minded friends 4. intellectual, by reading literature, listening to lectures, and, most importantly, simply listening more 5. spiritual, through transcendental meditation 6. sexual Recognize when you are backsliding into a childish or adolescent behavior. Then pinpoint what old story is being triggered and tell yourself the truth of the situation. Let go of the lie. Instead of saying “I’m never going to cheat again,” say, “Today, I’m not going to do that thing that makes me feel weak and shameful about myself again.” You can’t have a relationship with someone hoping they’ll change. You have to be willing to commit to them as they are, with no expectations. Communicate and maintain healthy boundaries. This means finding the proper balance of filtering and protecting your self, thoughts, feelings, time, and behaviors without either closing off behind walls, or becoming overwhelmed or overwhelming. Ask yourself throughout the day, “What do I need to do in this moment to take care of myself?” Be aware of what legitimate needs and wants you’re not attending to, and then take actions to meet them on your own - or ask your partner for help if you can’t. No one can make you feel anything and you don’t make anyone feel a certain way. So don’t take on responsibility for your partner’s feelings and don’t blame your partner for yours. The most caring thing to do when they’re upset is simply to ask if they want you to listen, to give advice, to give them space, or to give them loving touch. Whatever your decisions, actions, feelings, and thoughts throughout the day may be and whatever outcome they may lead to, if you are healthy, then they are ultimately healthy. You can’t change a person unless they’re in diapers. To paraphrase the relationship writer Harville Hendrix, the unconscious purpose of a long-term relationship is to finish childhood. Or, as psychiatrist Eric Berne puts it even more succinctly, “Love is nature’s psychotherapy.” Relationships don’t require sacrifices. They just require growing up - and the ability to stop clinging to immature needs that are so tenacious, they keep the mature needs from getting met. It takes hard, conscious, diligent work to genuinely change. Any style of relationship is the right one, as long as it’s a decision made by the whole person and not the hole in the person.","Deep look at romantic relationships.

The Entrepreneur Roller Coaster,Darren Hardy,0990798623,9,"It’s really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time, so if you don’t love it, if you aren’t having fun doing it, and you don’t really love it, you’re going to give up. If you don’t love it, you’re going to fail. Elon Musk said that starting a company is like “staring into the abyss and eating glass.” “Looking for my passion” is just an excuse in disguise. We use it to cover up for the fact that we’re not progressing, growing, and taking action in life. What about Bono, Branson, or Oprah? If you saw their schedules - the day in, day out demands they are under, and the pressure they shoulder - you wouldn’t think what they do 95 percent of the time is that great at all. The rest of their days are spent in endless meetings, negotiations, contract reviews, lawsuits, makeup chairs, rehearsals, travel, and transportation. I don’t care what you do, it’s going to suck most of the time. Tell yourself, “This work is going to suck 95 percent of the time.” I do not love what I do. But I sure as heck love why I do it. I am passionate about my mission of empowering entrepreneurs. Bring passion to how you do even the most (seemingly) mundane tasks. I’ve seen mechanics, gardeners, toll takers, cab drivers, project managers, CPAs, lawyers, and CEOs execute the “hows” of their work with great passion and joy. Their passion was in the quality of the activity, the execution, and the outcome. Refocus your mind and attention on who is being served by what you do, why and how you do it. Being successful in business requires an emotional charge. If that charge comes from your desire to right a wrong, fight the good fight, or seek justice, then it’s just as good as love and often even better. Don’t get involved with functions that are not in your circle of competency or strength. It doesn’t do you any good, and it certainly won’t make your ride any easier. If you’d rather be anywhere than doing your great work on a Saturday morning, then you’re probably doing the wrong thing or looking at it the wrong way. A belief in inborn gifts and limits is much gentler on the psyche. The reason I’m not a great musician, leader, communicator, parent, spouse, athlete, salesperson, or whatever is because I’m not “wired” to be one. Thinking of talent as “innate” makes our world more manageable, more comfortable. It takes away the burden of expectation. It relieves people of distressing comparisons. Define freak: a person who is obsessed with or unusually enthusiastic about a specified interest. If one crab realizes there’s nothing keeping him in the trap and tries to leave, the other crabs will do anything they can to stop him. They will repeatedly pull him from the side of the cage. What does success mean to me? Have you ever asked yourself the question? Have you actually written down your answer? If I ever felt myself getting caught up in or brought down by what other people thought of me, whether or not they approved of what I was doing (or wearing), all I had to do is ask myself if they would be one of the ten people to cry at my funeral. Instantly their rejection would lose any power over my emotions. If you’re going to get better, you have to push yourself. If you push yourself, you’re going to fall. If you’re not falling, you’re not pushing. Falling is part of getting better. What’s the number one restaurant in the world? Answer: McDonald’s. What’s the number one wine in the world? Answer: Franzia. It’s not a whoever-has-the-best-product-wins world. The one thing that matters most in determining whether your business succeeds or fails miserably is sales. The ultimate success of a product or service is 10 percent product quality and 90 percent sales. The person who knows how to get, keep, and cultivate a customer gets paid the most. Everything starts with sales. Nothing matters until you sell something. Nothing. You can vision cast, dream board, but there is no business until a sale happens. A sale tells you if you even have a business. I always have to laugh a little when someone says, “Oh, I’m not a salesperson.” Then they launch into a ten-minute, detailed “sales” presentation - complete with bullet points and case studies - selling me on the fact that they’re no good at selling. Whereas before I had always thought of sales as a way to get something, I could now see it as a tool for giving. Sales isn’t about selling at all. Stop selling. Help instead. The number one quality of the most effective sales and marketing messages? Empathy. Your best sales and marketing language in those words - language that shows you know who they are, who they are trying to become, and what they are trying to do. Bad dating: “He was a nice guy and certainly nice to look at… but he didn’t ask a single question about me. He just kept talking.” Effective sales is about finding a perceived need and helping someone fulfill it. If the customer doesn’t perceive the need, there is no need. The misguided drive to “create” a need is why we see so much chest-beating, egocentric marketing out there. It’s obnoxious, exhausting, and what’s worse, it’s ineffective. If you want to master one skill that will skyrocket your sales success, learn how to ask better questions. Guy that sold a bunch of condos: “I sold a $4 million parking space, a $2.8 million gym and spa access pass, and a $6 million closet.” He discovered what was most important to each client. Instead of trying to sell candy bars one by one, sell them box-by-box. Parents’ friends who had access to offices filled with candy lovers. These well-connected people emptied boxes of candy for him. Mark has never sold accounts one by one. Looked instead for influencers: people with their own large networks who, if sold on his idea, venture, or opportunity, could potentially generate entire volumes of transactions for him. “I lose one out of five for being too aggressive.” She paused for effect, then added, “But I get the other four!” SUCCESS magazine had a record-breaking launch: over a million copies sold. With the help of eight believers. Just eight people who saw the vision and got on board. Entrepreneurs are hopeless romantics. Which makes us terrible hiring managers. Get help! HIRING MISTAKE: Someone shows belief in our grand plan, we want to believe in them. We are major suckers for someone, anyone, who shows enthusiasm for our cause. Entrepreneurs see the potential in everything and everyone, and we are happy to hire on hope alone. You can’t hire enthusiasm. You need to hire evidence. Recruit people who already have, by evidence. This means being extremely rational and pragmatic. Hire evidence, not hope. The average “good” employee simply isn’t all that productive. The average cost of a bad hire is about 6 to 15 times the person’s annual salary. Great employees can set you free. Free from the things you aren’t good at. Free from the things you hate. Free from the daily “emergencies” and decisions that shouldn’t consume your days, but always seem to. Great employees truly are incredible, and they make your life easier and your business better in every way. A-players want to work with other A-players! You might be thinking you can’t afford to hire A-Players. Good news: they’re free! Because A-Players pay for themselves. The single most important thing you need to do is pick the right people and keep them. There is NOTHING more important than this. Know what you want. Always be the dumbest one in the room. “if I have a better idea than my Marketing Director, we are in trouble. If I solve a problem my CFO has been stumped with for a week, we are doomed.” Don’t train your people to be successful. Hire successful people. Warren Buffett looks for: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And he warns that if they don’t have that first quality, the others will work against you. What attributes do you want? Never even list the compensation plan. I always just say, “much better than market standard.” What makes work fun is doing meaningful work. Hire ahead of your growth. Hire to conquer new frontiers. Hire to launch new initiatives. But don’t hire to put out a fire. The only constraint of a company’s growth and potential is the owner’s ambition. I am the constraint. The market, the opportunity, everything is there. It’s up to me to set the pace, clear the obstacles, get the resources, and create the conversations to grow the company faster. As CEO, the most important thing I manage is myself. Do that right, and everything else falls into place. As the leader, you ultimately have 100 percent responsibility for everything. When a widget rolls off the line with a broken thingamajig, it’s not the fault of the guy who was texting instead of quality-controlling. It’s your fault. When a customer is mistreated at a store halfway across the country, don’t blame the customer service agent with a bad attitude. You’re to blame. Everyone hates bosses. Don’t be a boss. And managers are wienies. Don’t be a manager. Become a Twenty-First Century Leader. As the leader, you set the pace. You create the standards. This string is like an army. Push it from behind, and it doubles up on itself - you get nowhere. To drive it forward you have to pull it from the front, and it will follow you in perfect order.” Leadership lesson in preschool, where we learned to walk in a straight line. She walked in front, leading the way, and at every turn she called to us: “Follow me!” Leadership in the twenty-first century is less about the words that come out of you and more about what exists within you. Whatever you are doing in your business right now, your goal really is to find a way to quit it. You need to stop doing almost everything you do at the office. Be a quitter. Get enough sales going so you can quit taking out the trash and hire someone else to do it. Get more sales going, then quit doing the accounting. Hire a specialist to do it. Get more sales going and quit doing customer service, too. You want to go from everything to nothing - except leading. We are a team, not a family. Hire, develop, and cut smartly so we have stars in every position. The big secret of how to get it all done? Don’t. Just do the vital functions (amazingly well) and build a great team of capable players who are excellent at the rest. So I bought a stopwatch and wore it around my neck all day. I turned it on every time I did one of those vital three functions and turned it off the split second I stopped. Can you guess what that (evil) stopwatch said? Less than 20 minutes out of a 16-hour day. Success has less to do with what we can get ourselves to do and more to do with keeping ourselves from doing what we shouldn’t. An inbox actually is the modern day mailroom! (So don't work in the mailroom.) Delegation requires humility. A recognition that you aren’t the only one who can do something well, quickly, and competently. Stop being a narcissist and let go. He’s figured out his one vital function. What’s yours? What’s your one thing that contributes the most to your enterprise? What is your greatest contribution to making your rocket ship fly? “The client will pay whatever it takes,” we said. “How much would it cost for Sir Richard to attend?” Here’s the response from his office: “No amount of money would matter. Right now, Richard has three strategic priorities he is focused on, and he will only allow us to allocate his calendar to something that significantly contributes to the accomplishment of one of those three priorities, and speaking for a fee is not one of them.” If you have more than three priorities, you don’t have any. Warren Buffett’s key to success: “For every hundred great opportunities that are brought to me, I say ‘no’ ninety-nine times.” Make sure that the next time you consider saying “yes” (when you really should be saying “no”), it’s a “Hell Yeah!” or don’t even consider it. “Why do you do what you do?” I was quick to respond, “Impact. To positively impact people’s lives and futures.” A: “Then measure that.” Metrics. For instance: New database opt-ins. The three goals that if you achieved them, would make this year, undeniably, the best year of your life. Tracking your habits prevents drift. You need to know if you’re on track. It’s not what you learn or what you know; it’s what you do with what you know and learn. Reading 32 books means you’re reading a lot, but does it mean you’re applying it? We have a tendency to say, oh, that book, that CD, that program, that seminar didn’t work. Noooooo, it wasn’t the material that didn’t work. You didn’t do the work. Each quarter I figure out what skill is most needed to advance my BIG 3 goals, and I then attack it. I buy the top five books on the topic, the top three audio or video programs on the topic, and sign up for (at least) one seminar focused on that skill. Then I spend the quarter studying, practicing, and tracking my improvement on that vital skill. Every dollar you invest in your personal development adds thirty to your bottom line. I made $150,000 that year, and I took $15,000 and reinvested it in my personal development. The following year, I grew tremendously, and I’ve followed his advice ever since. The greatest athletes in the world hire the most expensive coaches, consultants, and advisors. The greatest companies do the same. Once you dig (find someone or something you like), keep drilling - go deeper. The fundamentals of success are simple and easy - getting yourself to stick to them is the difficult part. Don’t make it even more difficult by confusing yourself with too many arbitrary opinions and conflicting ideas. Habituate yourself to fear. Do the thing you fear over and over again, until you train your brain that it’s no longer something to be feared. Now his achievement on the tennis court meant something new. It was a means to fund his mission - a way to raise millions for a goal he truly believed in. “I had houses. Too many houses. I invested money. Money! I should have been investing my heart. What I needed was more people. More relationships.” “If you could come back and live the life of anyone, who would you want to come back as?” His answer: “I would want to come back as the man I could have been, but never was.”",Rar!

The Wisdom of No Escape,Pema Chödrön,1570628726,9,"People often think that somehow they’re going to improve, which is a sort of subtle aggression against who they really are. “If I could meditate and calm down, I’d be a better person.” Develop our curiosity, not caring whether the object of our inquisitiveness is bitter or sweet. We can endure a lot of pain and pleasure for the sake of finding out who we are and what this world is. If, at the end of each day, someone were to play a video of you back to yourself and you could see it all. You would wince quite often and say “Ugh!” You probably would see that you do all those things for which you criticize all those people you don’t like in your life, all those people that you judge. Basically, making friends with yourself is making friends with all those people too, because when you come to have this kind of honesty, gentleness, and goodheartedness, combined with clarity about yourself, there’s no obstacle to feeling loving-kindness for others as well. One of the major obstacles to what is traditionally called enlightenment is resentment, feeling cheated, holding a grudge about who you are, where you are, what you are. It doesn’t do any good to try to get rid of our so-called negative aspects, because in that process we also get rid of our basic wonderfulness. Become more awake to who we are and what we’re doing rather than trying to improve or change or get rid of who we are or what we’re doing. “I’m always suspicious of the ones who say everything’s going well. If you think that things are going well, then it’s usually some kind of arrogance. If it’s too easy for you, you just relax. You don’t make a real effort, and therefore you never find out what it is to be fully human.” When you begin to think that everything is just perfect and feel complacent and superior to the others, watch out! You were very good right from the beginning, but I knew if I told you that you were good, you would stop trying. Work with ourselves in the same way. Three qualities that we can nurture, cultivate, and bring out: precision, gentleness, and the ability to let go. The key to feeling more whole and less shut off and shut down is to be able to see clearly who we are and what we’re doing. Meditation is about seeing clearly the body that we have, the mind that we have, the domestic situation that we have, the job that we have, and the people who are in our lives. It’s about seeing how we react to all these things. The desire to change is fundamentally a form of aggression toward yourself. Open beyond small-mindedness and to let go of any kind of fixation or limited view. You may be completely caught up in a fantasy, in remembering the past or planning for the future. Then suddenly you realize, and you just come back. Letting go of those thoughts. One of the most amazing tools given, the ability to just let things go, not to be caught in the grip of your thoughts Resentment, bitterness, and holding a grudge prevent us from seeing and hearing and tasting and delighting. A woman running away from tigers. She comes to the edge of a cliff, she climbs down and holds on to the vines. She sees that there are tigers below her as well. A mouse is gnawing away at the vine. Sees a beautiful little bunch of strawberries close to her, growing out of a clump of grass. She takes a strawberry, puts it in her mouth, and enjoys it thoroughly. This is actually the predicament that we are always in, in terms of our birth and death. It might be the only moment of our life, it might be the only strawberry we’ll ever eat. The Navajo teach their children that every morning when the sun comes up, it’s a brand-new sun. “The sun has only one day. You must live this day in a good way, so that the sun won’t have wasted precious time.” You’re always standing in the middle of a sacred circle. This room is not the sacred circle. Gampo Abbey is not the sacred circle. Stick to one vehicle and go deeper and deeper and deeper. Life is such a miracle, and a lot of the time we feel only resentment about how it’s all working out for us. “Are you sure you want to attain enlightenment?” And the woman said, “Of course I’m sure.” Whereupon the smiling woman turned into a demon, stood up brandishing a great big stick, and started chasing her, saying, “Now! Now! Now!” For the rest of her life, that lady could never get away from the demon who was always saying, “Now!” The biggest obstacle to taking a bigger perspective on life is that our emotions capture and blind us. When we start getting angry or craving things in a way that makes us feel miserable, we begin to shut down, shut out. Samurai comes to the wise man and says, “Tell me the nature of heaven and hell.” And the roshi says: “Why should I tell a scruffy, disgusting, miserable slob like you?” The samurai starts to get purple in the face, his hair starts to stand up, but the roshi won’t stop, he keeps saying, “A miserable worm like you, do you think I should tell you anything?” Consumed by rage, the samurai draws his sword, and he’s just about to cut off the head of the roshi. Then the roshi says, “That’s hell.” The samurai, who is in fact a sensitive person, instantly gets it, that he just created his own hell; he was deep in hell. It was black and hot, filled with hatred, self-protection, anger, and resentment, so much so that he was going to kill this man. Hell is just resistance to life. When you want to say no to the situation you’re in, it’s fine to say no, but when you build up a big case to the point where you’re so convinced that you would draw your sword and cut off someone’s head, that kind of resistance to life is hell. As soon as you begin to believe in something, then you can no longer see anything else. There are wars all over the world because people are insulted that someone else doesn’t agree with their belief system. Fundamental theism. You want something to hold on to, you want to say, “Finally I have found it. This is it, and now I feel confirmed and secure and righteous.” “If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha.” (A good laugh is the best way to kill the Buddha.) Continually to look one’s beliefs straight in the face, honestly and clearly, and then step beyond them. It’s part of being human to feel discomfort. We don’t even have to call it suffering. Resisting life causes suffering. The cessation of suffering is letting go of holding on to ourselves. Our nostalgia for wanting to stay in a protected, limited, petty world is insane. The wilder the weather is, the more the ravens love it. They challenge the wind. They get up on the tops of the trees and they hold on with their claws and then they grab on with their beaks as well. At some point they just let go into the wind and let it blow them away. Then they play on it, they float on it. After a while, they’ll go back to the tree and start over. It’s a game. Too often we’re victims of not enough nurturing in the beginning, and we don’t know when we’ve grown up. Some of us at the age of fifty or sixty or seventy are still wondering what we’re going to be when we grow up. We remain children in our heart of hearts, which is to say, fundamentally theists. The way to live is to cut the ties, to cut the umbilical cord and alone start the journey of being fully human, without confirmation from others. This refusal to look at our unfinished business. If every time the warrior goes and meets the dragon, he or she says, “Hah! It’s a dragon again. No way am I going to face this,” and just splits, then life becomes a recurring story of getting up in the morning, going out, meeting the dragon, saying, “No way,” and splitting. You become more and more timid. If you’re alone and you feel lonely and you wish you had a mate, that’s the vehicle for waking up. If you have a huge family around you and wish you had a little more free time, that’s the vehicle for waking up. Whatever you have, that’s it. There’s no better situation than the one you have. It’s made for you. Taking refuge in the brotherhood and sisterhood of people who are committed to taking off their armor. If we live in a family where all the members are committed to taking off their armor, then one of the most powerful vehicles of learning how to do it is the feedback that we give one another. Develop a complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions and all people. A complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions and to all people, experiencing everything totally without reservations or blockages, so that one never withdraws or centralizes into oneself.” Always trying to escape and therefore never really fully settling down and appreciating. There are two common forms of human neurosis: One is getting all caught up in all that occurs, somehow captured by occurrence as if we were caught in a whirlpool. A preference for occurrence. I’m so hot I open all the windows, and then I’m so cold I put on a sweater. Then it itches, so I put cream on my arms, and then that’s sticky, so I go take a bath. Then I’m cold, so I close the window, and on and on and on. I’m lonely, so I get married, and then I’m always fighting with my husband or my wife, so I start another love affair, and then my wife or husband threatens to leave me and I’m caught in the confusion of what to do next, and on and on and on. The other neurosis is to get caught by peace and quiet, or liberation, or freedom. We experience clarity or bliss, we want to keep it going. Wanting to feel good forever. Arranging your life in such a way that it’s very quiet, very smooth, very simplified; you become so attached to it that you just want to keep it like that. You resist and resent any kind of noisy situation. Samsara and Nirvana are one, not preferring stillness or occurrence but being able to live fully with both. Hold the sadness and pain of samsara in your heart and at the same time the power and vision of the Great Eastern Sun. Then the warrior can make a proper cup of tea. If you can live with the sadness of human life, if you can be willing to feel fully and acknowledge continually your own sadness and the sadness of life, but at the same time not be drowned in it, because you also remember the vision and power of the Great Eastern Sun, you experience balance and completeness, joining heaven and earth, joining vision and practicality. Ritual is about joining vision and practicality, heaven and earth, samsara and nirvana. When things are properly understood, one’s whole life is like a ritual or a ceremony. Rituals that get handed down are like that. Someone can have an insight, and rather than its being lost, it can stay alive through ritual. The teachings of the Buddha, are like a recipe for fresh-baked bread. Thousands of years ago someone discovered how to bake bread, and because the recipe was passed down for years and years, you can still make fresh bread that you can eat right now. There are so many wonderful books on the basic teachings; you can read Joseph Goldstein and Ayya Khema and Suzuki Roshi and Chögyam Trungpa and Tarthang Tülku and all the translations of Herbert Guenther. Nothing that you have ever heard is separate from your life. To know yourself or study yourself is to forget yourself, and if you forget yourself then you become enlightened by all things. The dharma never tells you what is true or what is false. It just encourages you to find out for yourself. “The everyday practice is simply to develop complete acceptance of all situations, emotions, and people.” That sounds like that’s what’s true and not to do that would be false. But that’s not what it says. What it does say is to encourage you to find out for yourself what is true and what is false. Try to live that way and see what happens. Insight, which means that you have a fresh take on what is true. Someone switches on all the lights and reveals a palace. You say, “Wow! it’s always been here.” Sharing insights. It feels as if we’ve discovered something that no one else ever knew, and yet it’s completely straightforward and simple. It’s all very well to know it intellectually, but how do you feel about it? What is your experience of this? You might know that the first precept is not to kill, but the question really is, when the desire to kill something arises, why is it that you want to kill something? What’s really going on there? And what would the benefit be of refraining from killing? What does refraining do? How do you feel when you refrain? What does it teach you? Each religion or philosophical belief or New Age group has a kind of wisdom that it carries. Stick to one boat, because otherwise the minute you really begin to hurt, you’ll just leave or you’ll look for something else. Shopping is actually always trying to find security, always trying to feel good about yourself. When one sticks to one boat, whatever that boat may be, then one actually begins the warrior’s journey. The warrior’s journey is often extremely inconvenient. When you take refuge and become a Buddhist, there’s the sense of leaving home and becoming homeless. You’ve left the shore, but you haven’t arrived anywhere yet. You don’t know where you’re going, and you’ve been out there at sea long enough that you only have a vague memory of where you came from. It’s so inconvenient. It’s much more convenient to be home. Opting for coziness, having that as your prime reason for existing, becomes a continual obstacle to taking a leap and doing something new, doing something unusual, like going as a stranger into a strange land. When I would start to become depressed, I would remember, I just have to figure out how to rouse myself genuinely, because there are a lot of people suffering like this, and if I can do it, they can do it. If you really have these questions, you’ll find the answers everywhere. But if you don’t have a question, there’s certainly no answer. A big wave that comes along and knocks you down. You stand up and you begin walking again. Then the next wave comes and knocks you down. The waves just keep coming, but each time you get knocked down, you stand up and keep walking. After a while, you’ll find that the waves appear to be getting smaller.” When all the walls fall down, when the cocoon completely disappears and we are totally open to whatever may happen, with no withdrawing, no centralizing into ourselves. That is what we aspire to, the warrior’s journey.","Powerful thoughts on not running, distracting, or escaping, but sticking with something all the way through."
When Things Fall Apart,Pema Chödrön,1570623449,9,"Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth. Things become very clear when there is nowhere to escape. He said he was determined to get rid of his negative emotions. All his meditation had been nothing but further separation and struggle. He accepted - really accepted wholeheartedly - that he was angry and jealous, that he resisted and struggled, and that he was afraid. He accepted that he was also precious beyond measure - wise and foolish, rich and poor, and totally unfathomable. Intimacy with fear caused his dramas to collapse, and the world around him finally got through. Become familiar with fear. Move closer. Nothing is what we thought. Emptiness, mindfulness, fear, compassion, love, Buddha nature, courage. Not what we thought. These are code words for things we don’t know in our minds, but any of us could experience them. These are words that point to what life really is when we let things fall apart and let ourselves be nailed to the present moment. A monastery has very few means of escape: no lying, no stealing, no alcohol, no sex, no exit. Not knowing is the most important thing of all. We don’t know anything. We call something bad; we call it good. But really we just don’t know. When things fall apart and we’re on the verge of who-knows-what, the test for each of us is to stay on that brink and not concretize. Thinking that we can find some lasting pleasure and avoid pain is a hopeless cycle that goes round and round endlessly and causes us to suffer greatly. The off-center, in-between state is an ideal situation: a situation in which we don’t get caught and we can open our hearts and minds beyond limit. Relaxing in the midst of chaos, learning not to panic - this is the spiritual path. Disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear, instead of being bad news, are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we’re holding back. They teach us to perk up and lean in when we feel we’d rather collapse and back away. Events and people in our lives who trigger our unresolved issues could be regarded as good news. We don’t need to try to create situations in which we reach our limit. They occur all by themselves. We use all kinds of ways to escape. All addictions stem from the moment when we meet our edge and we just can’t stand it. We feel we have to soften it, so we become addicted to whatever it is that seems to ease the pain, so we don’t have to feel the full impact of the pain that arises when we cannot manipulate the situation to make us come out looking fine. It’s so good to meditate every single day and continue to make friends with our hopes and fears again and again. When we see our indulging and our repressing clearly, they begin to wear themselves out. Wearing out is not exactly the same as going away. After a while, we stop struggling and relax in our daily lives. As each breath went out and dissolved, there was the chance for all that had gone before to die, and to relax instead of panic. Say to ourselves “thinking” and, without making it a big deal, to simply return again to the out-breath. Each time you say to yourself “thinking,” you are cultivating that unconditional friendliness toward whatever arises in your mind. Thoughts go through our minds all the time. Whether we call it pleasant or unpleasant, the instruction is to label it all “thinking” with as much openness and kindness as we can muster and let it dissolve back into the big sky. He said it was never a good idea to struggle in meditation. So if our legs or back were hurting, we were told it was fine to move. However, it became clear that by working with proper posture, it was possible to become far more relaxed and settled in one’s body by making very subtle adjustments. We are not striving to make pain go away or to become a better person. In fact, we are giving up control altogether and letting concepts and ideals fall apart. Meet whatever arises with curiosity and don't make it such a big deal. Three kinds of awakening: awakening from the dream of ordinary sleep, awakening at death from the dream of life, and awakening into full enlightenment from the dream of delusion. The way to dissolve our resistance to life is to meet it face to face. When we feel resentment because the room is too cold, we could meet the cold and feel its iciness and its bite. There is no cure for hot and cold. They will go on forever. Being preoccupied with our self-image is like being deaf and blind. It’s like standing in the middle of a vast field of wildflowers with a black hood over our heads. It’s like coming upon a tree of singing birds while wearing earplugs. Mindfulness: It’s a lifetime’s journey to relate honestly to the immediacy of our experience and to respect ourselves enough not to judge it. It’s painful to face how we harm others. We see our desires and our aggression, our jealousy and our ignorance. Don't grab for entertainment the minute we feel a slight edge of boredom coming on. Practice not immediately filling up space just because there’s a gap. Refraining - breaking the habit of acting out impulsively - has something to do with giving up entertainment mentality. Warrior asked Fear, “How can I defeat you?” Fear replied, “If you don’t do what I say, I have no power.” A thoroughly good relationship with ourselves means there’s no compulsiveness. We don’t overwork, overeat, oversmoke, overseduce. In short, we begin to stop causing harm. Our minds at ease are like a still lake without ripples: so full of unlimited friendliness for all the junk at the bottom of the lake that we don’t feel the need to churn it up. Not causing harm requires staying awake. Part of being awake is slowing down enough to notice what we say and do. The more we witness our emotional chain reactions and understand how they work, the easier it is to refrain. It becomes a way of life to stay awake, slow down, and notice. Without giving up hope that there’s somewhere better to be, or someone better to be, we will never relax with where we are or who we are. Theism is a deep-seated conviction that there’s some hand to hold: if we just do the right things, someone will appreciate us and take care of us. It means thinking there’s always going to be a babysitter available when we need one. We all are inclined to abdicate our responsibilities and delegate our authority to something outside ourselves. Nontheism is relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of the present moment without reaching for anything to protect ourselves. Trying to get lasting security teaches us a lot, because if we never try to do it, we never notice that it can’t be done. When we feel suffering, it doesn’t mean that something is wrong. Hope robs us of the present moment. We feel that someone else knows what’s going on, but that there’s something missing in us, and therefore something is lacking in our world. Acknowledge that right now we feel like a piece of shit. Explore the nature of that piece of shit. We can’t just jump over ourselves as if we were not there. Monastic rules that advise renouncing liquor, renouncing sex, and so on are not pointing out that those things are inherently bad or immoral, but that we use them as babysitters. We use them as a way to escape; we use them to try to get comfort and to distract ourselves. Begin with hopelessness. All anxiety, all dissatisfaction, all the reasons for hoping that our experience could be different are rooted in our fear of death. Experience hopelessness, giving up all hope of alternatives to the present moment. Hopelessness is the basic ground. Otherwise, we’re going to make the journey with the hope of getting security. Instead of automatically falling into habitual patterns, we can begin to notice how we react. When someone praises us, how do we react? When someone blames us, how do we react? When we’ve lost something, how do we react? When we feel we’ve gained something, how do we react? When we become inquisitive about these things, look into them, see who we are and what we do, with the curiosity of a young child, what might seem like a problem becomes a source of wisdom. It’s actually a desire to know, like the questions of a three-year-old. We want to know our pain so we can stop endlessly running. We want to know our pleasure so we can stop endlessly grasping. Then somehow our questions get bigger and our inquisitiveness more vast. We want to know about loss so we might understand other people when their lives are falling apart. Feel more tenderness for the human race. When we feel lonely, when we feel hopeless, what we want to do is move to the right or the left. We don’t want to sit and feel what we feel. We don’t want to go through the detox. We automatically want to cover over the pain in one way or another, identifying with victory or victimhood. When we can rest in the middle, we begin to have a nonthreatening relationship with loneliness, a relaxing cool loneliness. Less desire, contentment, avoiding unnecessary activity, complete discipline, not wandering in the world of desire, and not seeking security from one’s discursive thoughts. Be lonely without resolution when everything in us yearns for something to cheer us up. Be lonely with no alternatives, content to be right here with the mood. Unnecessary activity is a way of keeping ourselves busy so we don’t have to feel any pain. Obsessively daydreaming of true romance: our minds just go wild trying to come up with companions to save us from despair. Sit still, just be there, alone. Sit still long enough to realize it’s how things really are. We are fundamentally alone. This basic truth hurts, and we want to run away from it. But coming back and relaxing with something as familiar as loneliness is good discipline for realizing the profundity of the unresolved moments of our lives. What we’re doing as we progress along the path is leaving home and becoming homeless. Trying to deny that things are always changing, we lose our sense of the natural scheme of things. Impermanence is meeting and parting. It’s falling in love and falling out of love. Impermanence is bittersweet, like buying a new shirt and years later finding it as part of a patchwork quilt. Peace is the well-being that comes when we can see the infinite pairs of opposites as complementary. We don’t like the way reality is now and therefore wish it would go away fast. But nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know. Listening to the teachings of Buddha, or practicing meditation is nothing other than studying ourselves. The reason that we’re here in this world at all is to study ourselves. Honesty without kindness makes us feel grim. Being irritated by ourselves and our lives and other people’s idiosyncrasies becomes overwhelming. That’s why there’s so much emphasis on kindness. The only reason that we don’t open our hearts and minds to other people is that they trigger confusion in us that we don’t feel brave enough or sane enough to deal with. To the degree that we look clearly and compassionately at ourselves, we feel confident and fearless about looking into someone else’s eyes. The more we relate with others, the more quickly we discover where we are blocked, where we are unkind, afraid, shut down. Be soft and nonjudgmental to whatever we see right at that very moment. To relate with others compassionately is a challenge. Really communicating to the heart and being there for someone else - our child, spouse, parent, client, patient, or the homeless woman on the street - means not shutting down on that person, which means, first of all, not shutting down on ourselves. This means allowing ourselves to feel what we feel and not pushing it away. Only in an open space where we’re not all caught up in our own version of reality can we see and hear and feel who others really are, which allows us to be with them and communicate with them properly. A Zen teacher who runs a project for the homeless said he doesn’t really do this work to help others; he does it because he feels that moving into the areas of society that he had rejected is the same as working with the parts of himself that he had rejected. There's a barrier called blame that keeps us from communicating genuinely with others, and we fortify it with our concepts of who’s right and who’s wrong. Blaming others is a very common, ancient, well-perfected device for trying to feel better. Blaming is a way to protect our hearts. Could our minds and our hearts be big enough just to hang out in that space where we’re not entirely certain about who’s right and who’s wrong? It’s more daring and real to not shut anyone out of our hearts. Be mindful not only of what feels comfortable, but also of what pain feels like. Aspire to stay awake and open to what we’re feeling. We think that by protecting ourselves from suffering we are being kind to ourselves. The truth is, we only become more fearful, more hardened, and more alienated. We experience ourselves as being separate from the whole. This separateness becomes like a prison for us, a prison that restricts us to our personal hopes and fears and to caring only for the people nearest to us. Two kinds of selfish people: the unwise and the wise. Unwise selfish people think only of themselves, and the result is confusion and pain. Wise selfish people know that the best thing they can do for themselves is to be there for others. As a result, they experience joy. The poet Jalaluddin Rumi writes of night travelers who search the darkness instead of running from it, a companionship of people willing to know their own fear. Spiritual awakening is frequently described as a journey to the top of a mountain. We leave our attachments and our worldliness behind and slowly make our way to the top. At the peak we have transcended all pain. The only problem with this metaphor is that we leave all the others behind - our drunken brother, our schizophrenic sister. Their suffering continues, unrelieved by our personal escape. Open our hearts and allow ourselves to feel that pain, feel it as something that will soften and purify us and make us far more loving and kind. Don’t set out to save the world. Set out to wonder how other people are doing and to reflect on how our actions affect other people’s hearts. Give away whatever blocks connecting. Give away our dark glasses, our long coats, our hoods, and our disguises. Let ourselves be touched. The magic of discipline and not being swayed by moods. What we discipline is not our “badness” or our “wrongness.” What we discipline is any form of potential escape from reality. In other words, discipline allows us to be right here and connect with the richness of the moment. Discipline provides the support to slow down enough and be present enough so that we can live our lives without making a big mess. If you sit still, you’ll see something. If you’re very quiet, you’ll hear something. The more we connect with a bigger perspective, the more we connect with energetic joy. It’s like waking up on a cold, snowy day in a mountain cabin ready to go for a walk but knowing that first you have to get out of bed and make a fire. You’d rather stay in that cozy bed, but you jump out and make the fire because the brightness of the day in front of you is bigger than staying in bed. One of the best practices for everyday living when we don’t have much time for meditation is to notice our opinions. We tend to take them as truth. Label them as opinions, just as we label thoughts as thoughts. All ego really is, is our opinions, which we take to be solid, real, and the absolute truth about how things are. To have even a few seconds of doubt about the solidity and absolute truth of our own opinions, just to begin to see that we do have opinions, introduces us to the possibility of egolessness. We don’t have to make these opinions go away, and we don’t have to criticize ourselves for having them. Don’t let ourselves be swept away by opinions of good and evil or hope and fear. The less our speech and actions are clouded by opinion, the more they will communicate. Do everything as if it were the only thing in the world that mattered, while all the time knowing that it doesn’t matter at all. To speak and act without aggression is an enormous challenge. Ideas about how to live and how to act and what is important in life. Intellectually he knew all about compassion, but when he saw a filthy, lice-infested dog, he looked away. The truth is like a dog yearning over a bowl of burning oil. He can’t leave it, because it is too desirable, and he can’t lick it, because it is too hot. Meditation practice is how we stop fighting with ourselves, how we stop struggling with circumstances, emotions, or moods. Start by working with the monsters in your mind: “It is wonderful you demons came today. You must come again tomorrow. From time to time, we should talk.” Invite what scares us to introduce itself and hang around for a while. In her tradition they did not exorcise demons. They treated them with compassion. Approach what you find repulsive, help the ones you think you cannot help, and go to places that scare you. Use difficult situations to awaken our genuine caring for other people. Instead of thinking of it as sitting down to meditate, we can think of it as training to lighten up, to have a sense of humor, to relax. Thinking that we have ample time to do things later is the greatest myth, the greatest hang-up, and the greatest poison. If we knew that tonight we were going to go blind, we would take a longing, last real look at every blade of grass, every cloud formation. If we knew that we were going to be deaf tomorrow, we would treasure every single sound. The samaya bond: If the student accepts and trusts the teacher completely and the teacher accepts the student, they can enter into the unconditional relationship called samaya. The teacher will never give up on the student no matter how mixed up he or she might be, and the student will also never leave the teacher, no matter what. The student and teacher are bound together. It’s like a pact that they make to attain enlightenment together. The whole samaya relationship - whether it’s with the phenomenal world as absolute teacher or with an individual person - is about softening us up. It softens us up so that we can’t deceive ourselves. Looking for alternatives - better sights than we see, better sounds than we hear, a better mind than we have - keeps us from realizing that we could stand with pride in the middle of our life and realize it’s a sacred mandala. The student of vajrayana Buddhism should always be in a state of panic. It is so unfamiliar to us to make such a total commitment to being awake that it unnerves us. What the dharma is about; turning all our habits around, reversing the process of how we make everything so solid, Stop. Do something unfamiliar. Do anything besides rushing off in the same old direction, up to the same old tricks. The source of wisdom is whatever is going to happen to us today. If we find ourselves in what seems like a rotten or painful situation, think, “Well, how is this enlightenment?” We feel frequently - maybe continuously - at a crossroads, never knowing what’s ahead. It’s an insecure way to live. Use it as a question about how to let this very situation wake us up further. Use a difficult situation to encourage ourselves to take a leap, to step out into that ambiguity. There are two ways to go to the gas chamber, free or not free.","Profound philosophy on facing the negative emotions head-on and getting to know them well, instead of trying to avoid them or escape."
The Compound Effect,Darren Hardy,159315724X,9,"There are no new fundamentals. Truth is not new. It’s old. You already know all that you need to succeed. You don’t need to learn anything more. If all we needed was more information, everyone with an Internet connection would live in a mansion, have abs of steel, and be blissfully happy. Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right hand behind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in your math? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summer until you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, work harder, work smarter. Be the guy who says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the crowd. Small, seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference. If you were given a choice between taking $3 million in cash this very instant and a single penny that doubles in value every day for 31 days, which would you choose? A great new restaurant: People started lining up to eat there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated. Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take its success for granted. The place was out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing what made them successful to begin with. Their success clouded their perspective and they slacked off. Write out the half-dozen small, seemingly inconsequential steps you can take every day that can take your life in a completely new and positive direction. Write down the small, seemingly inconsequential actions you can stop doing that might be compounding your results downward. List a few areas, skills, or outcomes where you have you been most successful in the past. Consider whether you could be taking those for granted and are not continuing to improve, and are therefore in jeopardy of having that complacency lead to future failure. How many of my behaviors have I not ‘voted on’? What am I doing that I didn’t consciously choose to do, yet continue to do every day? Have you ever been bitten by an elephant? How about a mosquito? It’s the little things in life that will bite you. The decisions you think don’t make any difference at all. It’s the little things that inevitably and predictably derail your success. Everyone says, “Of course, I take responsibility for my life.” But then you look at how most people operate in the world. There’s a lot of finger pointing, victimhood, blaming, and expecting someone else or the government to solve their problems. If you’ve ever blamed traffic for being late, or decided you are in a bad mood because of something your kid, spouse, or co-worker did, you’re not taking 100 percent personal responsibility. We’re all lucky. If you are on the right side of the dirt, have your health, and a little food in your cupboard, you are incredibly lucky. The difference between becoming fabulously rich, happy, and healthy, or broke, depressed, and unhealthy, is the choices you make throughout life. Nothing else will make the difference. Richard Branson if he felt lucky: “Luck surrounds us every day; we are constantly having lucky things happen to us, whether you recognize it or not. I have not been any more lucky or unlucky than anyone else. The difference is when luck came my way, I took advantage of it.” The (Complete) Formula for Getting Lucky: Preparation (personal growth) + Attitude (belief/mindset) + Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) + Action (doing something about it) = Luck Picture where you want to be: richer, thinner, happier, you name it. The first step toward change is awareness. Become very conscious of every choice you make. Track every action that relates to the area of your life you want to improve. If you’ve decided you want to lose weight, you’re going to track everything you put into your mouth. If you’ve decided to train for an athletic event, you’re going to track every step you take, every workout you do. Track in this one area for three weeks. Something doesn’t become a habit until you practice it for three weeks. If an item was listed at fifty dollars, consider the potential value of that same fifty dollars after it has been invested for twenty years. Ask, “Is this item worth $250?” If it’s worth $250 to you today, then it’s worth buying. The difference between the No. 1 ranked golfer and the No. 10 golfer is an average of only 1.9 strokes, but the difference in prize money is $10M vs $2M. We canceled her subscription to People magazine. It was time to study her own life. Suppose you’ve always wanted to play the piano, but feel it’s too late because you’re about to turn 40. If you start now, by the time you’re retirement age, you could be a master, as you’ll have been playing for 25 years! Increase her distance an eighth of a mile each outing. Within six months, she was running nine miles without any discomfort. In nine months, she was running 13.5 miles. 95 percent of everything we feel, think, do, and achieve is a result of a learned habit! If you took a bite of a Big Mac and immediately fell to the ground clutching your chest from a heart attack, you might not go back for that second bite. If your next puff of a cigarette instantly mutated your face into that of a weathered eighty-five-year-old, chances are you’d pass on that, too. If that first forkful of cake instantly put fifty pounds on your frame, saying “no thank you” to dessert would be the true piece of cake. Indulging in our bad habits doesn’t seem to have any negative effects at all in the moment. Nothing creates more stress than when our actions and behaviors aren’t congruent with our values. When you define your goals, you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. Your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside—your goal. Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can. Make a list of your most important goals. Go for whole-life success: balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well-being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle. Okay, I have my goal; now who do I need to become to get it? (“What kind of a man would a woman like this be looking for?”) In total, he was spending 3.5 hours with the news each day! This man wasn’t an economist or a commodities trader, or in any profession that lived or died by the latest news. write out your top three goals. Now make a list of the bad habits that might be sabotaging your progress in each area. Strategies for Eliminating Bad Habits: Identify Your Triggers. Are you more likely to drink too much when you’re with certain people? Is there a particular time of day when you just have to have something sweet? What emotions tend to provoke your worst habits—stress, fatigue? Clean House. If you want to stop drinking alcohol, remove every drop of it from your house. Clean your cupboards of all the crap, stop buying the junk food. Go on a “vice fast.” Pick one vice and abstain for thirty days. Proving to yourself that you're still in charge. The easiest thing to grab when you’re hungry is empty carbs. One strategy I use is to have protein on hand. I cook up a bunch of chicken on Sunday, and package it and have it ready for the week. I’m always happy when something is hard. Why? Because I know that most people won’t do what it takes. The space shuttle uses more fuel during the first few minutes of its flight than it does the rest of the entire trip. Why? Because it has to break free from the pull of gravity. Once you get momentum, you will be hard to stop—virtually unbeatable. This is why successful people tend to get more successful… the rich get richer… the happy get happier… the lucky get luckier. Momentum works on both sides. (Bad habits are creating a downward momentum.) Build your performance around world-class routines. You can almost always control how your day starts and ends. When the alarm sounds, I take my most important project and work on it for an hour of completely focused and undistracted effort. I take fifteen minutes to calibrate my day. This is where I brush over my top three one-year and five-year goals, my key quarterly objectives, and my top goal for the week and month. Then, for the most important part of the calibration appointment, I review (or set) my top three MVPs (Most Valuable Priorities) for that day. As long as I go through my morning routine, a majority of the key disciplines I need to be practicing are taken care of, and I’m properly grounded and prepared to perform at a much higher level than if I started each day erratically. When people get started in a new endeavor, they almost always overdo it. Everyone is affected by three kinds of influences: input (what you feed your mind) associations (the people with whom you spend time) environment (your surroundings) Your brain is programmed to seek out the negative—dwindling resources, destructive weather, whatever’s out to hurt you. (That's why TV/news is so appealing.) Who do you spend the most time with? Who are the people you most admire? Are those two groups of people exactly the same? If not, why not? Your associations don’t shove you in a direction; they nudge you ever so slightly over time. Their influence is so subtle. Think of your friends who order greasy appetizers or a cocktail before dinner. Meanwhile, your other friends order healthy food. I’m constantly weeding out of my life people who refuse to grow and live positively. To complaining friends: “Man, you’ve got to stop working on your presentation about how bad life is. I can hear you collecting all the data points to reinforce your beliefs.” I’ve got a neighbor who’s a three-minute friend. For three minutes, we have a great chit-chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high-school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three-day guy. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three-minute person. Who can I meet who can positively influence me? Let their glow rub off on you. Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. Teaming up with a peak performance partner, someone as equally committed to study and personal growth as you. “Let this be the last week that you don’t come to the table with an ah-ha.” Harvey Mackay, he told me, “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” John Wooden: “Mentoring is your true legacy. It is the greatest inheritance you can give to others. And it should never end. It is why you get up every day. To teach and be taught.” Never ask advice of someone with whom you wouldn’t want to trade places. (Restaurant overlooking cliff houses.) That environment had a powerful effect on me. Seeing those homes up on the cliffs fueled my ambition and expanded my dreams. I ended up working harder than I ever thought possible to make those dreams come true—and they did! whatever surrounds you. Creating a positive environment to support your success. The psychic clutter of whatever around you isn’t working, whatever’s broken, whatever makes you cringe. Each and every incomplete thing in your life exerts a draining force on you, Incomplete tasks keep calling you back to the past to take care of them. You get in life what you tolerate. If you tolerate your body being overweight, tired, and perpetually sick, it will be. I was sure I needed to take a break to go to the bathroom or get a glass of water. But instead of quitting, every time I hit one of those mental and emotional walls, I recognized that my competitors were facing the same challenges. I knew this was another moment that, if I kept going, I would be strides ahead of them. These were the defining moments of success and progress. “Don’t wish it were easier; wish you were better.” Weight training: reps done after you hit your max will multiply your results. Arnold Schwarzenegger “Cheating Principle”: once you reached your maximum number of lifts in perfect form, adjusting your wrists or leaning back to recruit other muscles to assist the working muscles (cheating a little) would allow you to do five or six more reps. Where in life can you do more than expected? Extra effort doesn’t cost that much more money or energy. When I was selling real estate, everyone else would call on expired listings when they came up. Instead, I got in my car and showed up on their doorstep and hand-delivered a “SOLD” sign. “Take this,” I’d say when they’d open the door. “You’ll need it if you hire me to take over this listing.” If I set my sights on something, I’m going to ensure success by going all in and all out. I launch what I call “shock and awe” campaigns. A company that needed a congressman to sign off on a piece of legislation. This guy wasn’t budging. I suggested we go above his head and talk to his boss—his wife. We went through our network until one person led us to someone who knew her. Then waited for her outside following a church service. He signed on by Tuesday. A CEO whose philosophy was to pay people, including his vendors and suppliers, a few days in advance of the contract commitment. I was always blown away when I received a check on the twenty-seventh of the month from him for next month’s payment. When I asked him about it, he said the obvious, “It’s the same money, but the surprise and good will it buys is immeasurable—why wouldn’t you?” What motivates me: My core value in life is significance. My desire is to make a positive difference in other people’s lives. Whatever I want in life, I’ve found that the best way to get it is to focus my energy on giving to others. If I want to boost my confidence, I look for ways to help someone else feel more confident. If I want to feel more hopeful, positive, and inspired, I try to infuse that in someone else’s day. If I want more success for myself, the fastest way to get it is to go about helping someone else obtain it. http://www.thecompoundeffect.com/","Classic self-help book, in the best sense. Inspired the hell out of me. Mostly fundamentals I had heard before, but put in a very energetic go-do-it way. As he says, “You already know all that you need to succeed.

When Cultures Collide,Richard D. Lewis,1904838022,9,"MENTALITY: Comparisons of national cultures often begin by highlighting differences in social behavior. These various manners and mannerisms cause us great amusement. We smile at foreign eccentricity, congratulating ourselves on our normality. And yet we are aware that these idiosyncrasies are largely superficial. We join strangers in their social actions partly to conform and partly for fun. But what goes on in our heads remains a private, well-protected constant. Whatever is said to you will be a brief projection of the inner world of the other person’s thoughts. There are few countries in the world where people do not believe, at the bottom of their hearts, that they are the best, or the most intelligent, or at least normal. It is remarkable how many common concepts are rooted so firmly in a similar manner in very different societies. Everyone has different notions of these concepts that appeal to so many cultures. Ethics can be turned upside down. The American calls the Japanese unethical if the latter breaks a contract. The Japanese says it is unethical for the American to apply the terms of the contract if things have changed. It is common sense in Germany and Sweden to form an orderly bus line. In Naples and Rio it is common sense to get on the bus before anyone else. We can achieve a good understanding of our foreign counterparts only if we realize that our “cultural glasses” are coloring our view of them. We need to examine the special features of our own culture. Once we realize that we, too, are a trifle strange, is to understand the subjective nature of our ethnic or national values. The American view that the individual must triumph. In the U.S. you start at the very bottom, give it all you’ve got, pull yourself up by your own boot straps, guts it out and get to the very top. It’s rags to riches, in a land where everybody is equal—in theory. It’s a daunting task, but fortunately Americans are unfailing optimists and future-oriented. They are opportunistic, quick to take chances. The history of the U.S. presented many golden opportunities to those who grabbed fastest. TIME: Switzerland and Germany, along with Britain, the Anglo-Saxon world in general, the Netherlands, Austria and Scandinavia, have a linear vision of time and action. They suspect, like the Americans, that time is passing (being wasted) without decisions being made or actions being performed. These groups are also monochronic; that is, they prefer to do only one thing at a time, to concentrate on it and do it within a fixed schedule. Linear-active people, like Swedes, Swiss, Dutch and Germans, do one thing at a time, concentrate hard on that thing and do it within a scheduled time period. These people think that in this way they are more efficient and get more done. Multi-active people think they get more done their way. Multi-active people do not like to leave conversations unfinished. For them, completing a human transaction is the best way they can invest their time. Reactive cultures excel in subtle, nonverbal communication, which compensates for the absence of frequent interjections. What is not said may be the main point of the reply. In data-oriented cultures, one does research to produce lots of information that is then acted on. Swedes, Germans, Americans, Swiss and Northern Europeans do this. Dialogue-orientated cultures: Italians and other Latins, Arabs and Indians. These people see events and business possibilities “in context” because they already possess an enormous amount of information through their own personal information network. Dialogue-oriented and multi-active people do ten things at once and are therefore in continuous contact with humans. They obtain from these people an enormous amount of information—far more than Americans or Germans will gather by spending a large part of the day in a private office, door closed, looking at the computer screen. Multi-active people are knee-deep in information. At meetings they tend to ignore agendas or speak out of turn. How can you forecast a conversation? Discussion of one item could make another meaningless. Americans are people of action; they cannot bear to be idle. Spaniards, Italians and Arabs will ignore the passing of time if it means that conversations will be left unfinished. For them, completing a human transaction is the best way they can invest their time. In China, they frequently complain that Americans, in China to do business, often have to catch their plane back to the U.S. “in the middle of the discussion.” The American sees the facts as having been adequately discussed; the Chinese feel that they have not yet attained that degree of closeness—that satisfying sense of common trust. The Japanese have a keen sense of the unfolding or unwrapping of time. This is well described by Joy Hendry in her book “Wrapping Culture”. It also involves love of compartmentalization of procedure, of tradition, of the beauty of ritual. Cultures observing both linear and cyclic concepts of time see the past as something we have put behind us and the future as something that lies before us. In Madagascar, the opposite is the case. The Malagasy imagine the future as flowing into the back of their heads, or passing them from behind, then becoming the past as it stretches out in front of them. The past is in front of their eyes because it is visible, known and influential. The Malagasy consider the future unknowable. It is behind their head where they do not have eyes. Buses in Madagascar leave, not according to a predetermined timetable, but when the bus is full. The situation triggers the event. How does one schedule an event where the Japanese will turn up 10 minutes early, the Germans and the Swiss on time, the Americans and British a bit late, the French after them and the Brazilians arriving an hour after the party was due to end? LANGUAGE: The language we speak largely determines our way of thinking, as distinct from merely expressing it. Thinking in two different languages gives us added dimensions of reality. Spaniards and Italians regard their languages as instruments of eloquence. To achieve greater expressiveness, they use their hands, arms and facial expressions and make maximum use of pitch and tone. They are not necessarily being dramatic or overemotional. They want you to know how they feel. They will appeal, directly and strongly, to your good sense, warm heart or generosity if they want something from you. Exaggeration and hyperbole are at the bottom of most American expressions, contrasting sharply with the understated nature of the British. America: when immigrants speaking many varieties of halting English were thrown together, the well-worn cliché was more understandable than originality or elegance of expression. The American language has never recovered from the exigencies of this period. Good manners, invented by the upper classes theoretically in the interests of smooth social intercourse, in fact developed into a repressive code which put people in their place. Happily, Americans resent being sorted out in this way and shortly afterwards invented bad manners, which saved us all a lot of trouble. “Complete September’s final report by 5:30 P.M.” comes out in Japanese as “It’s October 10th today, isn’t it? Our controller hasn’t asked to see September’s report yet. I wonder if he’ll come around tomorrow. You never know with him…” The actual order is never given—there is no need, the staff are already scrambling to their books. The French language is crisp and incisive, a kind of verbal dance or gymnastics of the mouth, which presses home its points with an undisguised, logical urgency. It is rational, precise, ruthless in its clarity. Sincerity takes us a long way. Europeans, Asians and Americans meet regularly on business and at conferences and manage to avoid giving offense, by and large, by being their honest selves. At such initial gatherings faux pas are ignored, even considered charming. COUNTRIES: Every country gets the government it deserves. Sub-Saharan Africa is divided into more than 600 culture groups. The European powers met in Berlin in 1884 and agreed on boundaries and spheres of influence. Such arbitrary divisions were disastrous for African culture, as the political map bore very little resemblance to the cultural, traditional one. This means that the term nation has little meaning for most Africans. The total African GDP (including the countries in the north) is only roughly the same as South Korea or the Netherlands. Cultural myopia - how ethnocentrism blinds us to the salient features of our own cultural makeup, while making us see other cultures as deviations from our correct system. -- AUTHOR: Richard D.

Antifragile,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,1400067820,9,"Some things thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, bacterial resistance. Hydra has numerous heads. Each time one is cut off, two grow back. So harm is what it likes. Hydra represents antifragility. Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile. Things are antifragile up to a certain level of stress. Your body benefits from some amount of mishandling, but only up to a point. “It builds character.” We are largely better at doing than we are at thinking. We want to survive uncertainty and have the last word. But how to domesticate, even dominate, even conquer, the unseen, the opaque, and the inexplicable? I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile. Many modern ailments seem to be associated with a lack of randomness in feeding and the absence of the stressor of occasional starvation. The tragedy of modernity: as with neurotically overprotective parents, those trying to help are often hurting us the most. We can live happily in a world we don’t understand. Don't confuse rationalizing with rational - the two are almost always exact opposites. Policies and actions in which the benefits are small and visible, and the side effects potentially severe and invisible. The medical fragilista overintervenes in denying the body’s natural ability to heal and gives you medications with potentially very severe side effects. Trenchant prose: no skill to understand it, mastery to write it. Heuristics are simplified rules of thumb that make things simple and easy to implement. But their main advantage is that the user knows that they are not perfect, just expedient. Black Swans dominate society and history (and people, because of ex post rationalization, think themselves capable of understanding them). As a consequence, we don’t quite know what’s going on, particularly under severe nonlinearities. It does not mean that one’s personal experiences constitute a sufficient sample to derive a conclusion about an idea; it is just that one’s personal experience gives the stamp of authenticity and sincerity of opinion. Being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant toward the nice. George Santayana: ""A man is morally free when he judges the world, and judges other men, with uncompromising sincerity."" Commerce is fun, thrilling, lively, and natural. Academia is none of these. Only academics and other non-real-world operators use the expression “real-world solution” instead of simply “solution.” The fragile wants tranquility, the antifragile grows from disorder, and the robust doesn’t care. Debt always fragilizes economic systems. I have an obsessive stance against government indebtedness. Book: ""Through the Language Glass"" by linguist Guy Deutscher Humans somehow fail to recognize situations outside the contexts in which they usually learn about them. How do you innovate? First, try to get in trouble. Innovation sparks from initial situations of necessity, in ways that go far beyond the satisfaction of such necessity. The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates! Moderns try today to create inventions from situations of comfort, safety, and predictability instead of accepting the notion that “necessity really is the mother of invention.” Cato looked at comfort as a road to waste. The automation of airplanes is making flying dangerously comfortable, dulling the pilot’s attention from too little challenge. “The albatross’s giant wings prevent him from walking” If tired, go to the gym for some exertion instead of resting. Most humans squander their free time, as free time makes them dysfunctional, lazy, and unmotivated. Have enough self-control to make the audience work hard to listen. Layers of redundancy are the central risk management property of natural systems. Redundancy is opportunistic, so such extra strength can be used to some benefit even in the absence of the hazard. What they call “inefficient” is often very efficient. Antifragile passion. Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it. Many wreck their reputations merely by trying to defend it. Fire feeds on obstacles. Criticism for a book is a truthful, unfaked badge of attention, signaling that it is not boring. Smear campaigns, if you can survive them, help enormously, conditional on the person appearing to be extremely motivated and adequately angry. To detect the independence and robustness of someone’s reputation: those who dress outrageously are robust or even antifragile in reputation; those clean-shaven types who dress in suits and ties are fragile to information about them. It is only when you don’t care about your reputation that you tend to have a good one. Those from whom we have benefited the most aren’t those who have tried to help us (say with “advice”) but rather those who have actively tried - but eventually failed - to harm us. Machines are harmed by low-level stressors (material fatigue), organisms are harmed by the absence of low-level stressors (hormesis). Humans eventually wear out (hopefully leaving their genes, books, or some other information behind. Much of aging comes from a misunderstanding of the effect of comfort - a disease of civilization. Society, economic activities and markets, and cultural behavior are apparently man-made but grow on their own to reach some kind of self-organization. They may not be strictly biological, but they resemble the biological in that, in a way, they multiply and replicate - think of rumors, ideas, technologies, and businesses. They are closer to the cat than to the washing machine but tend to be mistaken for washing machines. Your bones will get weaker if you spend a lot of time riding a bicycle. Humans tend to do better with acute than with chronic stressors, particularly when the former are followed by ample time for recovery, which allows the stressors to do their jobs as messengers. You pick up a language best from error to error, when you need to communicate under straining circumstances, situational difficulty, being forced to read the mind of the other person - suspending one’s fear of making mistakes. Touristification castrates by sucking randomness out - converting activities into a script. Writing is only worth it when it provides us with the tingling effect of adventure. An environment with variability does not expose us to chronic stress injury. If you walk on uneven, not man-made terrain, no two steps will ever be identical. The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile. Another business example: Restaurants are fragile; they compete with each other, but the collective of local restaurants is antifragile for that very reason. Had restaurants been individually robust, hence immortal, the overall business would be weak, and would deliver nothing better than cafeteria food. So some parts on the inside of a system may be required to be fragile in order to make the system antifragile as a result. From the outside, it looks like there is hormesis, but from the inside, there are winners and losers. Something hierarchically superior to that organism benefits from the damage. When you starve yourself of food, it is the bad proteins that are broken down first and recycled by your own body - a process called autophagy. It is often the mistakes of others that benefit the rest of us. Had the Titanic not had that famous accident, we would have kept building larger and larger ocean liners and the next disaster would have been even more tragic. So the people who perished were sacrificed for the greater good; they unarguably saved more lives than were lost. Every plane crash makes the next one less likely, but every bank crash makes the next one more likely. Someone who has made plenty of errors - though never the same error more than once - is more reliable than someone who has never made any. My characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. These types often consider themselves the “victims”. Modern society should be treating ruined entrepreneurs in the same way we honor dead soldiers. There is no such thing as a failed soldier, dead or alive (unless he acted in a cowardly manner) - likewise, there is no such thing as a failed entrepreneur or failed scientific researcher, any more than there is a successful babbler, philosophaster, commentator, consultant, lobbyist, or business school professor who does not take personal risks. Avoidance of small mistakes makes the large ones more severe. Switzerland is the most antifragile place on the planet; it benefits from shocks that take place in the rest of the world. Switzerland is the last major country that is not a nation-state, but rather a collection of small municipalities left to their own devices. Stability is achieved by managing noise, having a mechanism for letting it run its natural course, not by minimizing it. Some people have fallen for the naive turkey-style belief that the world is getting safer and safer, and of course they naively attribute it to the holy “state” (though bottom-up Switzerland has about the lowest rate of violence of any place on the planet). It is exactly like saying that nuclear bombs are safer because they explode less often. The European Union is legally protected from overcentralization thanks to the principle of subsidiarity: things should be handled by the smallest possible unit that can manage them with efficacy. Small forest fires periodically cleanse the system of the most flammable material, so this does not have the opportunity to accumulate. Buridan’s Donkey can be saved thanks to a random nudge. Inject random noise into a system to improve its functioning. Stochastic resonance, adding random noise to the background makes you hear the sounds (say, music) with more accuracy. The ancients perfected the method of random draw situations - and integrated it into divinations. These draws were really meant to pick a random exit without having to make a decision, so one would not have to live with the burden of the consequences later. You went with what the gods told you to do, so you would not have to second-guess yourself later. Medical error still currently kills between three times (as accepted by doctors) and ten times as many people as car accidents in the United States. It is generally accepted that harm from doctors - not including risks from hospital germs - accounts for more deaths than any single cancer. Having a word for something helps spread awareness of it. Capitalism is an inverse-iatrogenic effect, the unintended-but-not-so-unintended consequences: the system facilitates the conversion of selfish aims at the individual level into beneficial results for the collective. Phenomenology is the observation of an empirical regularity without a visible theory for it. Drachten, a town in the Netherlands, in which a dream experiment was conducted. All street signs were removed. The deregulation led to an increase in safety, confirming the antifragility of attention at work, how it is whetted by a sense of danger and responsibility. Be careful not to overgeneralize the Drachten effect, as it does not imply the effectiveness of removing all rules from society. It’s much easier to sell “Look what I did for you” than “Look what I avoided for you.” Of course a bonus system based on “performance” exacerbates the problem. Procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take care of themselves and exercise their antifragility. I defer the writing of a passage until my body tells me that I am ready for it. I once procrastinated and kept delaying a spinal cord operation as a response to a back injury - and was completely cured of the back problem after a hiking vacation in the Alps, followed by weight-lifting sessions. If I defer writing a section, it must be eliminated. This is simple ethics: Why should I try to fool people by writing about a subject for which I feel no natural drive? Someone imperturbable, with the ability to be calm under fire that is considered necessary to become a leader, only reacts to real information. Someone of the type we call neurotic, largely to noise. The difference between the two fellows will show us the difference between noise and signal. Noise is what you are supposed to ignore, signal what you need to heed. If you look at the very same data on a daily basis, the composition would change to 95 percent noise, 5 percent signal. And if you observe data on an hourly basis, as people immersed in the news and market price variations do, the split becomes 99.5 percent noise to 0.5 percent signal. That is two hundred times more noise than signal - which is why anyone who listens to news (except when very, very significant events take place) is one step below sucker. There is so much noise coming from the media’s glorification of the anecdote. We are separated from the real world. The media only report the most anecdotal and sensational cases (hurricanes, freak accidents, small plane crashes), giving us a more and more distorted map of real risks. By presenting us with explanations and theories, the media induce an illusion of understanding the world. The best way to mitigate interventionism is to ration the supply of information, as naturalistically as possible. Famine in China that killed 30 million people between 1959 and 1961. Next time someone in a suit and tie gave them projections for some dates in the future, they should ask him to show what he had projected in the past. The robust and antifragile don’t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile - and they do not need forecasting. Make things more robust to defects and forecast errors, or even exploit these errors, making lemonade out of the lemons. Switch the blame from the inability to see an event coming. Not seeing a tsunami or an economic event coming is excusable; building something fragile to them is not. We cannot afford to rely on the rationalistic elimination of greed and other human defects that fragilize society. Rather, make society benefit from the greed and other perceived defects of the human race. The Swedish government’s focus on total fiscal responsibility after their budget troubles in 1991 - it makes them much less dependent on economic forecasts. I suggest stocking up on novels, as we tend to underestimate the boredom of these long hours waiting for the trouble to dissipate. And books, being robust, are immune to power outages. The worst thing one can do to feel one knows things a bit deeper is to try to go into them a bit deeper. The sea gets deeper as you go further into it. To detouristify his traveling: he tried to inject some randomness into his schedule by never deciding on the next destination until he had spent some time in the first one. His next destination would be determined by his state of mind. By betting against fragility, they were antifragile. A man is honorable in proportion to the personal risks he takes for his opinion. To avoid the charity trap, systematically making donations, but not to those who directly asked for gifts. And he never, never gave a penny to any charitable organization, with the possible exception of those in which not a single person earned a salary. Fat Tony did not believe in predictions. But he made big bucks predicting that some people - the predictors - would go bust. Why? Someone who predicts will be fragile to prediction errors. An overconfident pilot will eventually crash the plane. And numerical prediction leads people to take more risks. Fat Tony is antifragile because he takes a mirror image of his fragile prey. Fat Tony’s model is quite simple. He identifies fragilities, makes a bet on the collapse of the fragile unit. Seneca was the wealthiest person in the Roman Empire. He focused on the practical aspect of Stoicism: how to handle adversity and poverty and, even more critically, wealth. To become a successful philosopher king, it is much better to start as a king than as a philosopher. “I lost nothing,” after an adverse event. Stoicism makes you desire the challenge of a calamity. And Stoics look down on luxury. He is in debt, whether he borrowed from another person or from fortune. Stoicism: What we learn from reading Seneca directly, rather than through the commentators, is a different story. Seneca’s version of that Stoicism is antifragility from fate. No downside from Lady Fortuna, plenty of upside. Success brings an asymmetry: you now have a lot more to lose than to gain. You are hence fragile. When you become rich, the pain of losing your fortune exceeds the emotional gain of getting additional wealth. Possessions make us worry about downside, thus acting as a punishment as we depend on them. All upside, no downside. Even more: dependence on circumstances - rather, the emotions that arise from circumstances - induces a form of slavery. Seneca’s practical method to counter such fragility was to go through mental exercises to write off possessions, so when losses occurred he would not feel the sting - a way to wrest one’s freedom from circumstances. It is similar to buying an insurance contract against losses. For my last job, I wrote my resignation letter before starting the new position, locked it up in a drawer, and felt free while I was there. It is hard to stick to a good discipline of mental write-off when things are going well, yet that’s when one needs the discipline the most. Stoicism is about the domestication, not necessarily the elimination, of emotions. The modern Stoic sage is someone who transforms fear into prudence, pain into information, mistakes into initiation, and desire into undertaking. Seneca proposes a complete training program to handle life and use emotions properly - thanks to small but effective tricks. A catalogue of social deeds: invest in good actions. Things can be taken away from us - not good deeds and acts of virtue. Simple test: if I have “nothing to lose” then it is all gain and I am antifragile. If you have less to lose than to gain, more upside than downside, then you like volatility and you are also antifragile. A Stoic is a Buddhist with attitude, one who says “f*** you” to fate. If you put 90 percent of your funds in boring cash (assuming you are protected from inflation) or something called a “numeraire repository of value,” and 10 percent in very risky, maximally risky, securities, you cannot possibly lose more than 10 percent, while you are exposed to massive upside. Someone with 100 percent in so-called “medium” risk securities has a risk of total ruin from the miscomputation of risks. A barbell can be any dual strategy composed of extremes, without the corruption of the middle - somehow they all result in favorable asymmetries. Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself. (Observe how people tend to provide for the best and hope that the worst will take care of itself.) Take literature, that most uncompromising, most speculative, most demanding, and riskiest of all careers. There is a tradition with French and other European literary writers to look for a sinecure, say, the anxiety-free profession of civil servant, with few intellectual demands and high job security, the kind of low-risk job that ceases to exist when you leave the office, then spend their spare time writing, free to write whatever they want, under their own standards. There is a shockingly small number of academics among French authors. American writers, on the other hand, tend to become members of the media or academics, which makes them prisoners of a system and corrupts their writing, and, in the case of research academics, makes them live under continuous anxiety, pressures, and indeed, severe bastardization of the soul. Every line you write under someone else’s standards, like prostitution, kills a corresponding segment deep inside. You can easily barbell yourself by removing the chances of ruin in any area. I am personally completely paranoid about certain risks, then very aggressive with others. The rules are: no smoking, no sugar (particularly fructose), no motorcycles, no bicycles in town or more generally outside a traffic-free area such as the Sahara desert, no mixing with the Eastern European mafias, and no getting on a plane not flown by a professional pilot. Outside of these I can take all manner of professional and personal risks, particularly those in which there is no risk of terminal injury. In social policy, it consists in protecting the very weak and letting the strong do their job, rather than helping the middle class to consolidate its privileges. The exercise regimen: going for the maximum weight one can lift, then nothing, compared to other alternatives that entail less intense but very long hours in the gym. This, supplemented with effortless long walks, constitutes an exercise barbell. Talk to either undergraduate students, cab drivers, and gardeners or the highest caliber scholars; never to middling-but-career-conscious academics. The barbell does not need to be in the form of investment in inflation-protected cash and the rest in speculative securities. Anything that removes the risk of ruin will get us to such a barbell. So just as Stoicism is the domestication, not the elimination, of emotions, so is the barbell a domestication, not the elimination, of uncertainty. The rational flâneur is someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision at every step to revise his schedule, so he can imbibe things based on new information. The flâneur is not a prisoner of a plan. The opportunism of the flâneur is great in life and business - but not in personal life and matters that involve others. The opposite of opportunism in human relations is loyalty, a noble sentiment - but one that needs to be invested in the right places, that is, in human relations and moral commitments. The error of thinking you know exactly where you are going and assuming that you know today what your preferences will be tomorrow has an associated one. Never ask people what they want, or where they want to go, or where they think they should go, or, worse, what they think they will desire tomorrow. This ability to switch from a course of action is an option to change. An option is what makes you antifragile and allows you to benefit from the positive side of uncertainty, without a corresponding serious harm from the negative side. “F*** you money” - a sum large enough to get most, if not all, of the advantages of wealth (the most important one being independence and the ability to only occupy your mind with matters that interest you) but not its side effects, such as having to attend a black-tie charity event. A vacation resort with the most options is more likely to provide you with the activity that satisfies your tastes, and the one with the narrowest choices is likely to fail. So you need less information, that is, less knowledge, about the resort with broader options. The option: it does not care about the average outcome, only the favorable ones. Your work and ideas are antifragile if instead of having one hundred percent of the people finding your mission acceptable or mildly commendable, you are better off having a high percentage of people disliking you and your message (even intensely), combined with a low percentage of extremely loyal and enthusiastic supporters. The luxury goods industry - jewelry, watches, art, expensive apartments in fancy locations, does not care about the average. Growth in society may not come from raising the average the Asian way, but from increasing the number of people in the “tails,” that small, very small number of risk takers crazy enough to have ideas of their own. Those endowed with that very rare ability called imagination, that rarer quality called courage, and who make things happen. You don’t have to be right that often. All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur. Steve Jobs at a famous speech: “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” He probably meant “Be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it.” Any trial and error can be seen as the expression of an option, so long as one is capable of identifying a favorable result and exploiting it. In trial and error, the rationality consists in not rejecting something that is markedly better than what you had before. “Life is long gamma.” means “benefits from volatility and variability.” All those brilliant minds who go to faraway conferences to discuss Gödel had to carry their suitcases through airport terminals, without thinking about applying their brain to such an insignificant transportation problem. Great geniuses invent their predecessors. Governments and universities have done very, very little for innovation and discovery, precisely because they look for the complicated, the lurid, the newsworthy, the narrated, the scientistic, and the grandiose, rarely for the wheel on the suitcase. People with too much smoke and complicated tricks and methods in their brains start missing elementary, very elementary things. Activity strips things to their simplest possible model. Antifragile risk taking - not education and formal, organized research - is largely responsible for innovation and growth. Practitioners don’t write; they do. Birds fly and those who lecture them are the ones who write their story. So it is easy to see that history is truly written by losers with time on their hands and a protected academic position. Knowledge formation, even when theoretical, takes time, some boredom, and the freedom that comes from having another occupation, therefore allowing one to escape the journalistic-style pressure of modern publish-and-perish academia to produce cosmetic knowledge. Since the winner will have an explosive payoff, uncapped, the right approach requires a certain style of blind funding. It means the right policy would be what is called “one divided by n” or “1/N” style, spreading attempts in as large a number of trials as possible: if you face n options, invest in all of them in equal amounts. 5 Small amounts per trial, lots of trials, broader than you want. Why? Because in Extremistan, it is more important to be in something in a small amount than to miss it. As one venture capitalist told me: “The payoff can be so large that you can’t afford not to be in everything.” Knowledge in complex domains inhibits research. Studying the chemical composition of ingredients will make you neither a better cook nor a more expert taster - it might even make you worse at both. Since you cannot forecast collaborations and cannot direct them, you cannot see where the world is going. All you can do is create an environment that facilitates these collaborations, and lay the foundation for prosperity. Planning: it makes the corporation option-blind, as it gets locked into a non-opportunistic course of action. Coca-Cola began as a pharmaceutical product. Tiffany & Co., the fancy jewelry store company, started life as a stationery store. The last two examples are close, perhaps, but consider next: Raytheon, which made the first missile guidance system, was a refrigerator maker (one of the founders was no other than Vannevar Bush, who conceived the teleological linear model of science we saw earlier; go figure). Now, worse: Nokia, who used to be the top mobile phone maker, began as a paper mill (at some stage they were into rubber shoes). DuPont, now famous for Teflon nonstick cooking pans, Corian countertops, and the durable fabric Kevlar, actually started out as an explosives company. Avon, the cosmetics company, started out in door-to-door book sales. When engaging in tinkering, you incur a lot of small losses, then once in a while you find something rather significant. Such methodology will show nasty attributes when seen from the outside. Under positive asymmetries, that is, the antifragile case, the “unseen” is positive. So “empirical evidence” tends to miss positive events and underestimate the total benefits. Those who teach at Harvard should be expected to have much less understanding of things than cab drivers or people innocent of canned methods of inference. (i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality (ii) preferably with open-ended, not closed-ended, payoffs (iii) Do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career (iv) Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business. The doers have not written a lot of books. Their memory has been treated very badly by history. Formal thinkers and theorizing theorizers tend to write books; seat-of-the-pants people tend to be practitioners who are often content to get the excitement, make or lose the money, and discourse at the pub. Their experiences are often formalized by academics; indeed, history has been written by those who want you to believe that reasoning has a monopoly or near monopoly on the production of knowledge. Formalists, to protect their turf, have always played on the logical fallacy that if quacks are found among nonacademics, nonacademics are all quacks. Seeing the nontransferability of skills from one domain to the other led me to skepticism in general about whatever skills are acquired in a classroom. What is picked up in the classroom stays largely in the classroom. Those who play blind chess games with an entire cohort can’t remember things outside the board better than a regular person. The biologist and intellectual E. O. Wilson was once asked what represented the most hindrance to the development of children; his answer was the soccer mom. They repress children’s natural biophilia, their love of living things. Soccer moms try to eliminate the trial and error, the nerds - that is, they are like computers except slower. Further, they are now totally untrained to handle ambiguity. One can be an intellectual without being a nerd, provided one has a private library instead of a classroom, and spends time as an aimless (but rational) flâneur benefiting from what randomness can give us inside and outside the library. Provided we have the right type of rigor, we need randomness, mess, adventures, uncertainty, self-discovery, near-traumatic episodes, all these things that make life worth living, compared to the structured, fake, and ineffective. Only the autodidacts are free. Erudites and businessmen, people whose position did not depend on credentials. My reading hours: between thirty and sixty a week, a practice I’ve kept up for a long time. I was getting humiliated by people who started smoking me with complicated math. So I read almost every book with “probability” or “stochastic” in its title. I read nothing else for a couple of years. I was hungry to go deeper into the problem of small probabilities. Find a problem first, and figure out the math that works for it. Much of what other people know isn’t worth knowing. The most severe mistake made in life is to mistake the unintelligible for the unintelligent. Socrates’ technique was to make his interlocutor, who started with a thesis, agree to a series of statements, then proceed to show him how the statements he agreed to are inconsistent with the original thesis, thus establishing that he has no clue as to what he was taking about. Socrates used it mostly to show people how lacking in clarity they were in their thoughts, how little they knew about the concepts they used routinely - and the need for philosophy to elucidate these concepts. He never lets the other person frame the question. An answer is planted in every question. Never respond with a straight answer to a question that makes no sense to you. Logic excludes - by definition - nuances, and since truth resides exclusively in the nuances, it is “a useless instrument for finding Truth in the moral and political sciences.” For Tony, the distinction in life isn’t True or False, but rather sucker or nonsucker. Things are always simpler with him. Exposure is more important than knowledge. Focus on the payoff from your actions instead of studying the structure of the world. The payoff, what happens to you (the benefits or harm from it), is always the most important thing, not the event itself. You decide principally based on fragility, not probability. We check people for weapons before they board the plane. Do we believe that they are terrorists: True or False? False, as they are not likely to be terrorists (a tiny probability). But we check them nevertheless because we are fragile to terrorism. There is an asymmetry. We are interested in the payoff, and the consequence, or payoff, of the True (that they turn out to be terrorists) is too large and the costs of checking are too low. Do you think the nuclear reactor is likely to explode in the next year? False. Yet you want to behave as if it were True and spend millions on additional safety, because we are fragile to nuclear events. Modify your exposure and learn to get out of trouble. I do not make appointments (other than lectures) except the very same morning, as a date on the calendar makes me feel like a prisoner. In spite of what is studied in business schools concerning “economies of scale,” size hurts you at times of stress; it is not a good idea to be large during difficult times. The hidden harm of fragility is that you need to be much, much better than random in your prediction and knowing where you are going, just to offset the negative effect. If you have favorable asymmetries, or positive convexity, options being a special case, then in the long run you will do reasonably well, outperforming the average in the presence of uncertainty. The more uncertainty, the more role for optionality to kick in, and the more you will outperform. This property is very central to life. It is the negative that’s used by the pros, those selected by evolution: chess grandmasters usually win by not losing; people become rich by not going bust. The learning of life is about what to avoid. You reduce most of your personal risks of accident thanks to a small number of measures. When it comes to knowledge, the same applies. The greatest - and most robust - contribution to knowledge consists in removing what we think is wrong - subtractive epistemology. In life, antifragility is reached by not being a sucker. Since one small observation can disprove a statement, while millions can hardly confirm it, disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. Keeping one’s distance from an ignorant person is equivalent to keeping company with a wise man. Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” We are moving into the far more uneven distribution of 99/1 across many things that used to be 80/20. Almost everything contemporary has winner-take-all effects, which includes sources of harm and benefits. A small number of employees in a corporation cause the most problems, corrupt the general attitude - and vice versa - so getting rid of these is a great solution. More data - such as paying attention to the eye colors of the people around when crossing the street - can make you miss the big truck. When you cross the street, you remove data, anything but the essential threat. If you have more than one reason to do something, just don’t do it. By invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason. Antifragility implies - contrary to initial instinct - that the old is superior to the new, and much more than you think. No matter how something looks to your intellectual machinery, or how well or poorly it narrates, time will know more about its fragilities and break it when necessary. What survives must be good at serving some (mostly hidden) purpose that time can see but our eyes and logical faculties can’t capture. Prophet, follow the Fat Tony method of focusing on shekels more than recognition. Technothinkers have autistic tendencies. Lack of charm, interest in objects instead of persons, causing them to neglect their looks. They love precision at the expense of applicability. And they typically share an absence of literary culture. This absence of literary culture is actually a marker of future blindness because it is usually accompanied by a denigration of history. To understand the future, you just need some respect for the past, some curiosity about the historical record, a hunger for the wisdom of the elders, and a grasp of the notion of “heuristics,” these often unwritten rules of thumb that are so determining of survival. You will be forced to give weight to things that have been around, things that have survived. Technology is at its best when it is invisible. When it displaces the deleterious, unnatural, alienating, and, most of all, inherently fragile preceding technology. For the perishable, every additional day in its life translates into a shorter additional life expectancy. For the nonperishable, every additional day may imply a longer life expectancy. The longer a technology lives, the longer it can be expected to live. Things that have been around for a long time are not “aging” like persons, but “aging” in reverse. Every year that passes without extinction doubles the additional life expectancy. Gott made a list of Broadway shows on a given day, May 17, 1993, and predicted that the longest-running ones would last longest, and vice versa. He was proven right with 95 percent accuracy. The mistake is to believe that one would be acting “young” by adopting a “young” technology. The illusion of the contribution of the new generations over the old - statistically, the “young” do almost nothing. Much progress comes from the young because of their relative freedom from the system and courage to take action that older people lose as they become trapped in life. But it is precisely the young who propose ideas that are fragile, not because they are young, but because most unseasoned ideas are fragile. And, of course, someone who sells “futuristic” ideas will not make a lot of money selling the value of the past! New technology is easier to hype up. Read the classics. The future is in the past. We rely more on water than on cell phones but because water does not change and cell phones do, we are prone to thinking that cell phones play a larger role than they do. We ignore that these implementations don’t usually stick. Most “innovations” are failures. When Lebanese run into Syrians, they focus on the tiny variations in their respective Levantine dialects, but when Lebanese run into Italians, they focus on similarities. A city should be devoted to pedestrians. More than a third of the residents in London are foreign-born. Books that are one year old are usually not worth reading, no matter the hype and how “earth-shattering” they may seem to be. Time can act as a cleanser of noise by confining to its dustbins all these overhyped works. Seemingly uninteresting results that go unnoticed, can, years later turn out to be breakthroughs. Companies that get hyped up for their potential and called “best” on the cover of magazines or in books such as Good to Great are about to underperform and one can derive an abnormal profit by shorting their stock). Get the proceedings of a random conference that took place five years ago. Odds are it will feel no different from a five-year-old newspaper. Attending breakthrough conferences might be a waste of time. Amateurs in any discipline are the best. Career professionals are to knowledge what prostitutes are to love. What to read: As little as feasible from the last twenty years, except history books that are not about the last fifty years. Corporations that are large today should be gone, as they have always been weakened by what they think is their strength: size, which is the enemy of corporations as it causes disproportionate fragility. Opinions pop up, as if reality cared about opinions and narratives. There are secrets to our world that only practice can reveal. This secret property is, of course, revealed through time, and, thankfully, only through time. The doctor insisted that I should “ice” my nose. The swelling was my own body’s response to the injury. It seemed to me that it was an insult to Mother Nature to override her programmed reactions unless we had a good reason to do so, backed by proper empirical testing to show that we humans can do better; the burden of evidence falls on us humans. There is no compelling empirical evidence in favor of the reduction of swelling. It was pure sucker-rationalism in the mind of doctors, following what made sense to boundedly intelligent humans, coupled with interventionism, this need to do something. Empiricism: the onus is on the doctors to show us why reducing fever is good, why eating breakfast before engaging in activity is healthy (there is no evidence). The hidden costs of health care are largely in the denial of antifragility. Diseases of civilization result from the attempt by humans to make life comfortable for ourselves against our own interest, since the comfortable is what fragilizes. In the very ill condition, the benefits are large relative to iatrogenics; in the borderline one, they are small. This means that we need to focus on high-symptom conditions and ignore, I mean really ignore, other situations in which the patient is not very ill. Mother Nature had to have tinkered through selection in inverse proportion to the rarity of the condition. Of the hundred and twenty thousand drugs available today, I can hardly find a via positiva one that makes a healthy person unconditionally “better” When you think you have found a free lunch, say, steroids or trans fat, something that helps the healthy without visible downside, it is most likely that there is a concealed trap somewhere. Why we have not been able to find drugs that make us feel unconditionally better when we are well (or unconditionally stronger, etc.): nature would have been likely to find this magic pill by itself. What Mother Nature does is rigorous until proven otherwise; what humans and science do is flawed until proven otherwise. Overriding nature requires some very convincing justification on our part. Lifting weights increases your muscle mass . In the past they used to say that weight lifting caused the “micro-tearing of muscles,” with subsequent healing and increase in size. Today some people discuss hormonal signaling or genetic mechanisms, tomorrow they will discuss something else. But the effect has held forever and will continue to do so. Theories come and go; experience stays. Add neurosomething to a field, and suddenly it rises in respectability and becomes more convincing as people now have the illusion of a strong causal link. An attribution problem arises when the person imputes his positive results to his own skills and his failures to luck. Applied to stockbrokers, doctors, and managers of companies. No doctor derives pleasure from the health of his friends, no soldier from the peace of his city. All these biases lead to action, almost never inaction. To be sophisticated you need to accept that you are not so. Ancestral men tended to die of trauma. The gains in life expectancy are more societal than from the result of scientific advance. We can cure many cases of diabetes by putting people on a very strict starvation-style diet, shocking their system. Drink no liquid that is not at least a thousand years old - so its fitness has been tested. Money has its own iatrogenics. Separating some people from their fortune would simplify their lives and bring great benefits in the form of healthy stressors. If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don’t take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing. And when you take risks, insults by half-men (small men, those who don’t risk anything) are similar to barks by nonhuman animals: you can’t feel insulted by a dog. Hammurabi’s code: Reestablish a symmetry of fragility: If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house - the builder shall be put to death. If it causes the death of the son of the owner of the house, a son of that builder shall be put to death. The builder knows more, a lot more, than any safety inspector, particularly about what lies hidden in the foundations - making it the best risk management rule ever, as the foundation, with delayed collapse, is the best place to hide risk. Save lives by providing up-front disincentive in case of harm to others during the fulfillment of one’s profession. The English had the families of the engineers spend time with them under the bridge after it was built. Every opinion maker needs to have “skin in the game” in the event of harm caused by reliance on his information or opinion. No opinion without risk. It's profoundly unethical to talk without doing, without exposure to harm, without having one’s skin in the game, without having something at risk. You express your opinion; it can hurt others (who rely on it), yet you incur no liability. Is this fair? Never ask anyone for their opinion, forecast, or recommendation. Just ask them what they have - or don’t have - in their portfolio. The best poet - in any language?- Odds are Almutanabbi. Corporate managers have incentives without disincentives - managers of businesses that are not owner-operated. Company executives are no entrepreneurs - just actors, slick actors (business schools are more like acting schools). Someone intelligent - or free - would likely implode under such a regimen. A corporation does not feel pity. A corporation does not have a sense of honor. A corporation does not have generosity. Only self-serving actions are acceptable. Just imagine what would happen to a corporation that decided to unilaterally cancel its receivables - just to be nice. Yet societies function thanks to random acts of generosity between people, even sometimes strangers. All of these defects are the result of the absence of skin in the game. Only a sense of honor can lead to commerce. Any commerce. One can rapidly become enslaved to a profession, to the point of having one’s opinions on any subject become self-serving, hence unreliable for the collective. For the English, humanity started at the rank of idle freeman, unpreoccupied with work. It never meant not working; it just meant not deriving your personal and emotional identity from your work, and viewing work as something optional, more like a hobby. In a way your profession does not identify you so much as other attributes. For Fat Tony, humanity started at the level of “self-ownership.” Being the owner of your opinion. And it has nothing to do with wealth, birth, intelligence, looks, shoe size, rather with personal courage. Definition of a free person: someone who cannot be squeezed into doing something he would otherwise never do. Anyone who goes into public service should not be allowed to subsequently earn more from any commercial activity than the income of the highest paid civil servant. It is like a voluntary cap (it would prevent people from using public office as a credential-building temporary accommodation, then going to Wall Street to earn several million dollars). One should give more weight to witnesses and opinions when they present the opposite of a conflict of interest. A pharmacist or an executive of Big Pharma who advocates starvation and via negativa methods to cure diabetes would be more credible than another one who favors the ingestion of drugs. Education, in the sense of the formation of character, personality, and acquisition of true knowledge, likes disorder; label-driven education and educators abhor disorder. Innovation is precisely something that gains from uncertainty: and some people sit around waiting for uncertainty and using it as raw material.","Bold perspectives, unusual ideas, and surprisingly wise advice around an interesting subject of the “opposite of fragile.” Looking through that lens at health, education, governments, business, and life philosophy. Very inspiring, and sparks a lot of further discussion."
The Willpower Instinct,Kelly McGonigal,1583334386,9,"The best way to improve your self-control is to see how and why you lose control. People who think they have the most willpower are actually the most likely to lose control when tempted. Why? They fail to predict when, where, and why they will give in. What is something that you would like to do more of, or stop putting off, because you know that doing it will improve the quality of your life? What is the “stickiest” habit in your life? What would you like to give up or do less of because it’s undermining your health, happiness, or success? What is the most important long-term goal you’d like to focus your energy on? What immediate “want” is most likely to distract you or tempt you away from this goal? To say no when you need to say no, and yes when you need to say yes, you need to remember what you really want. The main job of the modern prefrontal cortex is to bias the brain toward doing “the harder thing.” Every willpower challenge requires doing something difficult, whether it’s walking away from temptation or not running away from a stressful situation. Imagine yourself facing your specific willpower challenge. What is the harder thing? What makes it so difficult? How do you feel when you think about doing it? Some people find it useful to give a name to the impulsive mind, like “the cookie monster” to the part of you that always wants instant gratification. Giving a name to this version of yourself can help you recognize when it is taking over, and also help you call in your wiser self for some willpower support. Without desires we’d become depressed. People who are distracted are more likely to give in to temptations. Develop more self-awareness. Notice when you are making choices related to your willpower challenge. Catch yourself earlier and earlier in the process, noticing what thoughts, feelings, and situations are most likely to prompt the impulse. What do you think or say to yourself that makes it more likely that you will give in? The brain is remarkably responsive to experience. Ask your brain to do math every day, and it gets better at math. Ask your brain to worry, and it gets better at worrying. Ask your brain to concentrate, and it gets better at concentrating. Not only does your brain find these things easier, but it actually remodels itself based on what you ask it to do. Meditating makes you better at a wide range of self-control skills, including attention, focus, stress management, impulse control, and self-awareness. People who meditate regularly become finely tuned willpower machines. This simple act of staying still is part of what makes meditation willpower training effective. You’re learning to not automatically follow every single impulse. What is the harder thing? Imagine yourself facing your willpower challenge, and doing the harder thing. What makes it hard? We’re used to seeing temptation and trouble outside of ourselves: the dangerous doughnut, the sinful cigarette, the enticing Internet. But identify the inner impulse that needs to be restrained. What is the thought or feeling that makes you want to do whatever it is you don’t want to do? Next time you’re tempted, turn your attention inward. The pause-and-plan response: The most helpful response will be to slow you down, not speed you up (as a fight-or-flight response does). One way to immediately boost willpower: Slow your breathing down to four to six breaths per minute. The biggest mood-boosting, stress-busting effects came from five-minute doses of exercise. Anything above and beyond the typical sedentary lifestyle will improve your willpower reserve. Shorter bursts have a more powerful effect on your mood than longer workouts. You also don’t have to break a sweat or push yourself to exhaustion. Lower-intensity exercise, like walking, has stronger immediate effects than high-intensity exercise. He started to use the treadmill each morning to fuel up with willpower for the day’s difficult meetings and long hours. Why does poor sleep sap willpower? When you’re tired, your cells have trouble absorbing glucose from the bloodstream. This leaves them underfueled, and you exhausted. With your body and brain desperate for energy, you’ll start to crave sweets or caffeine. Stress is the enemy of willpower. So often we believe that stress is the only way to get things done, and we even look for ways to increase stress. Or we use stress to try to motivate others, but in the long term, nothing drains willpower faster than stress. Does being hungry or tired drain your willpower? Or emotions like anger, loneliness, or sadness? Self-control is highest in the morning and steadily deteriorates over the course of the day. Anytime you have to fight an impulse, filter out distractions, weigh competing goals, or make yourself do something difficult, you use a little more of your willpower strength. Pay attention to when you have the most willpower, and when you are most likely to give in. For your “I will” challenge, schedule it for when you have the most strength. When your blood sugar drops, your brain will still favor short-term thinking and impulsive behavior. Committing to any small, consistent act of self-control - improving your posture, squeezing a handgrip every day to exhaustion, cutting back on sweets, and keeping track of your spending - can increase overall willpower. Through each of these willpower exercises, the brain gets used to pausing before acting. • Strengthen “I Won’t” Power: Commit to not crossing your legs when you sit, or using your nondominant hand for a daily task • Strengthen “I Will” Power: Commit to doing something every day meditating for five minutes • Strengthen Self-Monitoring: Formally keep track of something you don’t usually pay close attention to. This could be your spending, what you eat, or how much time you spend online If your goal is to exercise more often, you might decide to do ten sit-ups or push-ups before your morning shower. Leaving candy out in a visible place can increase people’s general self-control (if they routinely resist the temptation). Despite the feeling of exhaustion that made it seem as though her feet and legs would not cooperate, they did. Whenever she thought, I can’t do this, she said to herself, “You are doing this,” and just kept putting one foot in front of the other, all the way to the finish line. Endurance athletes under extreme conditions: They found no evidence for physiological failure happening within the muscles; instead, it appeared that the brain was telling the muscles to stop. The brain creates an overwhelming feeling of fatigue that has little to do with the muscles’ capacity to keep working. Fatigue should no longer be considered a physical event but rather a sensation or emotion. In much the same way that the feeling of anxiety can stop us from doing something dangerous, our beliefs about what we are capable of may determine whether we give up or soldier on. The widely observed scientific finding that self-control is limited may reflect people’s beliefs about willpower, not their true physical and mental limits. The next time you find yourself “too tired” to exert self-control, challenge yourself to go beyond that first feeling of fatigue. When your willpower is running low, find renewed strength by tapping into your want power. For your biggest willpower challenge, consider the following motivations: How will you benefit from succeeding at this challenge? Who else will benefit if you succeed at this challenge? Imagine that this challenge will get easier for you over time if you are willing to do what is difficult now. Erin had to realize that staying calm was as much for herself as it was for her sons. See if there is another “want” that holds more power for you. Think about how we can best support the most exhausted version of ourselves - and not count on an ideal version of ourselves to show up and save the day. Train like an intelligent athlete, pushing our limits but also pacing ourselves. The exception to our usual desire to be consistent. When it comes to right and wrong, most of us are not striving for moral perfection. We just want to feel good enough - which then gives us permission to do whatever we want. Moral licensing: When you do something good, you feel good about yourself. This means you’re more likely to trust your impulses - which often means giving yourself permission to do something bad. People who first remember a time when they acted generously give 60 percent less money to a charitable request. Anything you moralize becomes fair game for the effect of moral licensing. If you tell yourself that you’re “good” when you exercise and “bad” when you don’t, then you’re more likely to skip the gym tomorrow if you work out today. This sense of entitlement too often becomes our downfall. Because we’re quick to view self-indulgence as the best reward for virtue, we forget our real goals and give in to temptation. When you feel like a saint, the idea of self-indulgence doesn’t feel wrong. It feels right. Like you earned it. And if the only thing motivating your self-control is the desire to be a good enough person, you’re going to give in whenever you’re already feeling good about yourself. It tricks us into acting against our best interests. It convinces us that self-sabotaging behavior - like having a smoke - is a “treat.” Human nature - we resist rules imposed by others for our own good. When you tell yourself that exercising, saving money, or giving up smoking is the right thing to do - not something that will help you meet your goals - you’re less likely to do it consistently. As she burned more calories, she couldn’t help imagining the food she was earning the right to eat. Making progress on a goal motivates people to engage in goal-sabotaging behavior. Self-control success has an unintended consequence: It temporarily satisfies - and therefore silences - the higher self. He loves productivity seminars because they make him feel so productive - never mind that nothing has been produced yet. Focusing on progress can hold us back from success. Progress can be motivating, and even inspire future self-control, but only if you view your actions as evidence that you are committed to your goal. You need to look at what you have done and conclude that you must really care about your goal, so much so that you want to do even more to reach it. People who are asked, “How committed do you feel to your goal?” are not tempted by the conflicting behavior. Actions need to be driven by “I did that because I wanted to,” NOT “I did that, great, now I can do what I really want!” Remember why you resisted. Remembering the “why” works because it changes how you feel about the reward of self-indulgence. That so-called treat will start to look more like the threat to your goals. The next time you find yourself using past good behavior to justify indulging, pause and remember the why. When McDonald’s added healthier items to its menu, sales of Big Macs skyrocketed. The mind gets so excited about the opportunity to act on a goal, it mistakes that opportunity with the satisfaction of having actually accomplished the goal. We wrongly predict we will have much more free time in the future than we do today. They asked a whole bunch of people to predict, “How many times per week (on average) will you exercise in the next month?” Then they asked another group of people the same question, with one important preface: “In an ideal world, how many times per week will you exercise in the next month?” The two groups showed no differences! We look into the future and fail to see the challenges of today. When you want to change a behavior, aim to reduce the variability in your behavior, not the behavior itself. Deprive yourself of the usual cognitive crutch of pretending that tomorrow will be different. View every choice you make as a commitment to all future choices. So instead of asking, “Do I want to eat this candy bar now?” ask yourself, “Do I want the consequences of eating a candy bar every afternoon for the next year?” Instead of asking “Would I rather do this today or tomorrow?” ask yourself, “Do I really want the consequences of always putting this off?” People who order a main dish advertised as a healthy choice also order more indulgent drinks, side dishes, and desserts. Although their goal is to be healthy, they end up consuming more calories than people who order a regular entrée. Dieting researchers call this a health halo. We feel so good about ordering something healthy, our next indulgence doesn’t feel sinful at all. Permission to indulge in something by focusing on its most virtuous quality? Magic words that give you permission to indulge, like “Buy 1 Get 1 Free,” “All Natural,” “Light,” “Fair Trade,” “Organic.” Any type of positive change requires knowing that who we are is the self that wants the best for us - and the self that wants to live in line with our core values. When this happens, we will no longer view the impulsive, lazy, or easily tempted self as the “real” us. We will no longer act like someone who must be bribed, tricked, or forced to pursue our goals, and then rewarded for making any effort at all. Do you identify more with your impulses and desires, or with your long-term goals and values? The promise of happiness - not the direct experience of happiness - is the brain’s strategy to keep you hunting, gathering, working, and wooing. When we add the instant gratification of modern technology to this primitive motivation system, we end up with dopamine-delivery devices that are damn near impossible to put down. Do you know what your own dopamine triggers are? Pay attention to what captures your attention. What unleashes that promise of reward that compels you to seek satisfaction? The website of Scent Air, a leader in the field of scent marketing, 18 brags about how it lured visitors into an ice cream parlor on the lower level of a hotel. With a strategically placed aroma-delivery system, they released the scent of sugar cookies to the top of the stairs and waffle cones to the bottom. The average passerby will think she is inhaling the authentic smell of the sweet treats. Instead, she is breathing in enhanced chemicals designed to maximize the firing of her dopamine neurons and lead her - and her wallet - straight down the stairs. The promise of reward is so powerful that we continue to pursue things that don’t make us happy, and consume things that bring us more misery than satisfaction. If you force your brain to reconcile what it expects from a reward - happiness, bliss, satisfaction, an end to sadness or stress - with what it actually experiences, your brain will eventually adjust its expectations. When we free ourselves from the false promise of reward, we often find that the thing we were seeking happiness from was the main source of our misery. The solution is not to eliminate wanting. Separate the real rewards that give our lives meaning from the false rewards that keep us distracted and addicted. Why does stress lead to cravings? Stress - including negative emotions like anger, sadness, self-doubt, and anxiety - shifts the brain into a reward-seeking state. You end up craving whatever substance or activity your brain associates with the promise of reward, and you become convinced that the “reward” is the only way to feel better. What do you turn to when you’re feeling stressed, anxious, or down? Some strategies really work: The most effective stress-relief strategies are exercising or playing sports, praying or attending a religious service, reading, listening to music, spending time with friends or family, getting a massage, going outside for a walk, meditating or doing yoga, and spending time with a creative hobby. (The least effective strategies are gambling, shopping, smoking, drinking, eating, playing video games, surfing the Internet, and watching TV or movies for more than two hours.) Terror creates an immediate need to do something to counter our feelings of powerlessness. We will reach for our security blankets, whatever makes us feel safe, powerful, or comforted. Dieters would feel so bad about any lapse - a piece of pizza, a bite of cake - that they felt as if their whole diet was blown. Instead of minimizing the harm by not taking another bite, they would say, “What the hell, I already blew my diet. I might as well eat the whole thing.” Pay special attention to how you handle any willpower failure. Do you criticize yourself and tell yourself that you’ll never change? Do you use the setback as an excuse to indulge further? Self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. Surprisingly, it’s forgiveness, not guilt, that increases accountability. Researchers have found that taking a self-compassionate point of view on a personal failure makes people more likely to take personal responsibility for the failure. We are most likely to decide to change when we are at a low point: Setting a resolution offers an immediate sense of relief and control. We don’t have to believe that we are the person who made that mistake; we can become a completely different person. Vowing to change fills us with hope. We love to imagine how making the change will transform our lives, and we fantasize about the person we will become. The decision to change is the ultimate in instant gratification - you get all the good feelings before anything’s been done. It was never meant to be a strategy for change. It’s a strategy for feeling better. Resolving to change is, for most people, the best part of the change process. It’s all downhill after that. Predicting how and when you might be tempted to break your vow increases the chances that you will keep a resolution. Ask yourself: When am I most likely to be tempted to give in? How am I most likely to let myself get distracted from my goal? What will I say to myself to give myself permission to procrastinate? When you have such a scenario in mind, imagine yourself in that situation, what it will feel like, and what you might be thinking. Let yourself see how a typical willpower failure unfolds. Then turn this imaginary failure into a willpower success. Consider what specific actions you could take to stick to your resolution. We humans have all sorts of mental tricks for convincing ourselves that the time to resist temptation is tomorrow. Delay discounting - the longer you have to wait for a reward, the less it is worth to you. Delay discounting explains why we choose immediate satisfaction at the cost of future happiness. Ask yourself what future rewards do you put on sale each time you give in to temptation or procrastination. What is the immediate payoff for giving in? What is the long-term cost? Is this a fair trade? Immediate reward triggers dopamine-induced desire. Future rewards delay gratification, the prefrontal cortex has to cool off the promise of reward. With distance between you and the temptation, the power of balance shifts back to the brain’s system of self-control. When immediate gratification comes with a mandatory ten-minute delay, the brain treats it like a future reward. For a cooler, wiser brain, institute a mandatory ten-minute wait for any temptation. To help you overcome the temptation to procrastinate. Flip the rule to “Do ten minutes, then you can quit.” When your ten minutes are up, give yourself permission to stop. 1. When you are tempted to act against your long-term interests, frame the choice as giving up the best possible long-term reward for whatever the immediate gratification is. 2. Imagine that long-term reward as already yours. Imagine your future self enjoying the fruits of your self-control. 3. Then ask yourself: Are you willing to give that up in exchange for whatever fleeting pleasure is tempting you now? Cortés burned those ships to guarantee that his men didn’t act on their fear. No choice but to go forward. Precommitment. (you think:) Future you always has more time, more energy, and more willpower than present you. We think about our future selves like different people. We often idealize them, expecting our future selves to do what our present selves cannot. Could fund-raisers exploit the future-self bias by asking people to pledge their future selves’ money instead of giving money now? Getting to know their future selves made the students more willing to invest in them - and, by extension, themselves. Think about what your future self will be doing, and how he or she will feel about the choices you’re making now? Do you have a hard time taking a break from work because there is always more to do? Do you feel so guilty or anxious about spending money that you find it hard to purchase anything beyond the absolute basics? Do you ever look back at how you have spent your time and money, and wish you had been more focused on your present happiness instead of always putting it off? If so, take the willpower experiments in this chapter and turn them into strategies for self-indulgence. The least-fit cadet in a squadron gradually brought down the fitness levels of the other cadets. Behaviors we typically view as being under self-control are, in important ways, under social control as well. Chaining bicycles to a fence right next to a prominent “No Bicycles” sign, and leaving grocery carts in a parking garage with a “Please Return Your Carts to the Store” policy. Their studies show that rule-breaking is contagious. People who stumble into the researchers’ setup take their cues from what other people have done, and ignore the signs. They, too, chain up their bikes and leave their carts in the garage. But the consequences go further than that. When people saw a bike chained to a no-bicycles fence, they were also more likely to take an illegal shortcut through the fence. When they saw carts in a parking garage, they were more likely to dump their trash on the floor of the garage. Is there someone who can serve as a willpower role model for your challenge? Someone who has struggled with the same challenge and succeeded, or someone who exemplifies the kind of self-control you would like to have? Thought suppression doesn’t work. When you try to push a thought away, and it keeps coming back to your mind, you are more likely to assume that it must be true. Because it’s easy to remember news stories about plane crashes, we tend to overestimate the likelihood of being in a crash. A distraught student who couldn’t stop thinking about killing herself. A fleeting thought had gotten lodged in her brain, and she had become convinced that she must really, deep down, want to kill herself. Otherwise, why would the idea keep intruding into her thoughts? Permission to think a thought reduces the likelihood of thinking it. The more you try to suppress negative thoughts, the more likely you are to become depressed. When people try to push away self-critical thoughts (“I’m such a loser,” “People think I’m stupid”), their self-esteem and mood plummet faster. People who try to suppress their fear before giving a public speech not only feel more anxious, but also have higher heart rates. Feel what you feel, but don’t believe everything you think. Restricting a food automatically increases your cravings for it. Try applying this advice to your own most challenging cravings, be they chocolate, cappuccinos, or checking e-mail. Notice that you are thinking about your temptation. Accept the thought or feeling without trying to immediately distract yourself. Step back by realizing that thoughts and feelings aren’t always under your control, but you can choose whether to act on them. Remember your goal. Remind yourself of whatever your commitment is. Surf the urge: When the urge takes hold, pause for a moment to sense your body. What does the urge feel like? Is it hot or cold? Do you feel tension anywhere in your body? What’s happening with your heart rate, your breathing, or your gut? Stay with the sensations for at least one minute. Surfing the urge is not just for addiction; it can help you handle any destructive impulse.","Amazing book about willpower from Stanford psychology professor who teaches just this. Killer first point: The best way to improve your self-control is to see how and why you lose control. This is a better book than the other book on Willpower here on my list, because it's more actionable, better written, better presented. Really amazing (IF you act on it!)"
Turning Pro,Steven Pressfield,1936891034,9,"Ambition is the most primal and sacred fundament of our being. To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our souls. Not to act upon that ambition is to turn our backs on ourselves and on the reason for our existence. When we're terrified of embracing our true calling, we'll pursue a shadow calling instead. That shadow career is a metaphor for our real career. Its shape is similar, but a shadow career entails no real risk. If we fail at a shadow career, the consequences are meaningless to us. Like getting your Ph.D. in Elizabethan studies because you're afraid to write. Ask yourself what your current life is a metaphor for. I could hang with the locals and shoot the breeze - but I always thought that, while they were trapped, I was free. In a few minutes I'd be clear of town and rolling down the highway. Of course this was all self-delusion. The road was taking me nowhere. I wasn't writing books. I wasn't facing my demons. The longer we cleave to this shadow life, the farther we drift from our true purpose, and the harder it becomes for us to rally the courage to get back. There's not a big difference between an artist and an addict. What's the difference? The addict is the amateur; the artist is the professional. When I say ""addiction,"" web-surfing counts too. So do compulsive texting, twittering and Facebooking. Distractions. Displacement activities. When we're living as amateurs, we're running away from our calling - meaning our work, our destiny, the obligation to become our truest and highest selves. To follow a calling requires work. It's hard. It hurts. It demands entering the pain-zone of effort, risk, and exposure. When you turn pro, your life gets very simple. The Zen monk, the artist, the entrepreneur often lead lives so plain they're practically invisible. The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a ""life,"" a ""character,"" a ""personality."" When we turn pro, the energy that once went into the Shadow Novel goes into the real novel. Addicts are boring because they never do the work. The definition of boring: something that's boring goes nowhere. It travels in a circle. It never arrives at its destination. Addictions embody repetition without progress. They produce incapacity as a payoff. Distraction and displacement seem innocent on the surface. How can we be harming ourselves by having fun, or seeking romance, or enjoying the fruits of this big, beautiful world? But lives go down the tubes one repetition at a time, one deflection at a time, one hundred and forty characters at a time. Resistance wants to keep us shallow and unfocused. So it makes the superficial and the vain intoxicating. Every Monday morning I walked into the village to the Bank of America and took out $25. That sum lasted me for the next seven days. I didn't talk to anybody during my year of turning pro. I didn't hang out. I just worked. I had a book in mind and I had decided I would finish it or kill myself. I could not run away again, or let people down again, or let myself down again. This was it, do or die. I had no TV, no radio, no music. No sex, no sports. I didn't read the newspaper. That year made me a pro. It gave me, for the first time in my life, an uninterrupted stretch of month after month that was mine alone, that nobody knew about but me, when I was truly productive, truly facing my demons, and truly working my shit. The habits and addictions of the amateur are conscious or unconscious self-inflicted wounds. Their payoff is incapacity. When we take our M1903 Springfield and blow a hole in our foot, we no longer have to face the real fight of our lives, which is to become who we are and to realize our destiny and our calling. The amateur is terrified that if the tribe should discover who he really is, he will be kicked out into the cold to die. The amateur's self-inflation prevents him from acting. He takes himself and the consequences of his actions so seriously that he paralyzes himself. The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans and they all start tomorrow. The tribe doesn't give a shit. There is no tribe. Just a conglomeration of individuals who are just as fucked up as we are and just as terrified. Each individual is so caught up in his own bullshit that he doesn't have two seconds to worry about yours. Our lives are entirely up to us. When we turn pro, everything becomes simple. Our aim centers on the ordering of our days in such a way that we overcome the fears that have paralyzed us in the past. We now structure our hours not to flee from fear, but to confront it and overcome it. We plan our activities in order to accomplish an aim. And we bring our will to bear so that we stick to this resolution. Turning pro is like kicking a drug habit or stopping drinking. It's a decision, a decision to which we must re-commit every day. Twelve-step programs say ""One Day at a Time."" The professional says the same thing. Each day, the professional understands, he will wake up facing the same demons, the same Resistance, the same self-sabotage, the same tendencies to shadow activities and amateurism that he has always faced. The difference is that now he will not yield to those temptations. He will have mastered them, and he will continue to master them. Carl Jung said that a person might have five ""big"" dreams in his life - dreams that provoke a shift in consciousness. Qualities that the professional possesses that the amateur doesn't: 1. The professional shows up every day 2. The professional stays on the job all day 3. The professional is committed over the long haul 4. For the professional, the stakes are high and real Further: 5. The professional is patient 6. The professional seeks order 7. The professional demystifies 8. The professional acts in the face of fear 9. The professional accepts no excuses 10. The professional plays it as it lays 11. The professional is prepared 12. The professional does not show off 13. The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique 14. The professional does not hesitate to ask for help 15. The professional does not take failure or success personally 16. The professional does not identify with his instrument 17. The professional endures adversity 18. The professional self-validates 19. The professional reinvents herself 20. The professional is recognized by other professionals Krishna said we have the right to our labor, but not to the fruits of our labor. He meant that the piano is its own reward, as is the canvas. When we project a quality or virtue onto another human being, we ourselves almost always already possess that quality, but we're afraid to embrace (and to live) that truth. The professional refuses to be iconized. Not for selfish reasons, but because he knows how destructive the dynamic of iconization is to the iconizer. What is a practice? To follow a rigorous, prescribed regimen with the intention of elevating the mind and the spirit to a higher level. A practice implies engagement in a ritual. A practice may be defined as the dedicated, daily exercise of commitment, will, and focused intention. A practice has a space, and that space is sacred. In the end, the enterprise and the sacrifice are all about the audience. They're about the readers, the moviegoers, the site visitors, the listeners. In the hero's journey, the wanderer returns home after years of exile, struggle, and suffering. He brings a gift for the people. That gift arises from what the hero has seen, what he has endured, what he has learned.","In the same vein as his other books “Do the Work” and ”War of Art” - but a message that needs to be said again and again to really get through. It's all about the resistance, avoiding distractions, getting serious. Here he dives more into the mindset shift of thinking of your art as a hobby versus a real career. This stuff shakes me to the core, every time."
Quiet,Susan Cain,52286565,9,"You're told that you're ""in your head too much."" There's another word for such people: thinkers. Introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating. Finland is a famously introverted nation. Finnish joke: How can you tell if a Finn likes you? He's staring at your shoes instead of his own. In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private. But when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to focus on how others perceived them. They became captivated by people who were bold and entertaining. The social role demanded of all in the new Culture of Personality was that of a performer. Extroversion is less prevalent in Asia and Africa than in Europe and America, whose populations descend largely from the migrants of the world. World travelers were more extroverted than those who stayed home. Americans found themselves working no longer with neighbors but with strangers. Facing the question of how to make a good impression on people to whom they had no civic or family ties. He worked a summer job in China. He was struck by how different the social norms were, and how much more comfortable he felt. In China there was more emphasis on listening, on asking questions rather than holding forth, on putting others' needs first. In the United States, he feels, conversation is about how effective you are at turning your experiences into stories, whereas a Chinese person might be concerned with taking up too much of the other person's time with inconsequential information. Peter Drucker: the most effective leaders had little or no charisma and little use either for the term or what it signifies. Most leading in a corporation is done in small meetings and it's done at a distance, through written and video communications. One of the finest leaders: This man lost focus when he interacted too much with people, so he carved out time for thinking and recharging. Extroverted leaders enhance group performance when employees are passive, but that introverted leaders are more effective with proactive employees. Introverts are more likely to say that they can express the ""real me"" online. It's always been private occasions that make me feel connected to the joys and sorrows of the world, often in the form of communion with writers and musicians I'll never meet in person. Unity between writer and reader ""that fruitful miracle of a communication in the midst of solitude."" ============== WHEN COLLABORATION KILLS CREATIVITY The Rise of the New Groupthink and the Power of Working Alone ============== ""I am a horse for a single harness, not cut out for tandem or teamwork, for well I know that in order to attain any definite goal, it is imperative that one person do the thinking and the commanding."" -ALBERT EINSTEIN Consider what Wozniak did right after the meeting in Menlo Park. Did he huddle with fellow club members to work on computer design? No. Did he seek out a big, open office space full of cheerful pandemonium in which ideas would cross-pollinate? No. When you read his account of his work process on that first PC, the most striking thing is that he was always by himself. Work alone. You're going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you're working on your own. Teach our kids to work independently. Some people wish to fit harmoniously into the group, and others to be independent of it. Often the most highly creative people are in the latter category. Open source attracts introverts. It's only when you're alone that you can engage in Deliberate Practice, Exceptionally creative people in the arts, sciences, business, and government, many of his subjects were on the social margins during adolescence, partly because intense curiosity or focused interest seems odd to their peers. Kafka: ""You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind. That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough."" Groups brainstorming electronically, when properly managed, not only do better than individuals, research shows; the larger the group, the better it performs. Participating in an online working group is a form of solitude all its own. Population density is correlated with innovation; despite the advantages of quiet walks in the woods, people in crowded cities benefit from the web of interactions that urban life offers. Four-month-olds who thrashed their arms like punk rockers did so not because they were extroverts in the making, but because their little bodies reacted strongly-they were ""high-reactive""-to new sights, sounds, and smells. The quiet infants were silent not because they were future introverts-just the opposite-but because they had nervous systems that were unmoved by novelty. High-reactive children pay what one psychologist calls ""alert attention"" to people and things. They literally use more eye movements than others to compare choices before making a decision. It's as if they process more deeply-sometimes consciously, sometimes not-the information they take in about the world. Many high-reactives become writers or pick other intellectual vocations where you're in charge: you close the door, pull down the shades and do your work. You're protected from encountering unexpected things. People who inherit certain traits tend to seek out life experiences that reinforce those characteristics. The most low-reactive kids, for example, court danger from the time they're toddlers, so that by the time they grow up they don't bat an eye at grown-up-sized risks. Scientists conditioned a rat to associate a certain sound with an electrical shock. Then they played that sound over and over again without administering the shock, until the rats lost their fear. But it turned out that this ""unlearning"" was not as complete as the scientists first thought. When they severed the neural connections between the rats' cortex and amygdala, the rats became afraid of the sound again. This was because the fear conditioning had been suppressed by the activity of the cortex, but was still present in the amygdala. In humans with unwarranted fears, like batophobia, or fear of heights, the same thing happens. Repeated trips to the top of the Empire State Building seem to extinguish the fear, but it may come roaring back during times of stress. Organize your life in terms of optimal levels of arousal. Set up your work, your hobbies, and your social life so that you spend as much time inside your sweet spot as possible. Introverts function better than extroverts when sleep deprived. Functional, moderate guilt may promote future altruism, personal responsibility, adaptive behavior in school, and harmonious, competent, and prosocial relationships with parents, teachers, and friends. High-reactive introverts sweat more. When someone offers you a beer, ""they're really saying hi, have a glass of extroversion."" Nomads who inherited the form of a particular gene linked to extroversion (specifically, to novelty-seeking) are better nourished than those without this version of the gene. But in settled populations, people with this same gene form have poorer nutrition. The same traits that make a nomad fierce enough to hunt and to defend livestock against raiders may hinder more sedentary activities like farming, selling goods at the market, or focusing at school. Sensitive people tend to speak softly because that's how they prefer others to communicate with them. ===================================== WHY DID WALL STREET CRASH AND WARREN BUFFETT PROSPER? How Introverts and Extroverts Think (and Process Dopamine) Differently ===================================== Extroverted clients are more likely to be highly reward-sensitive, while the introverts are more likely to pay attention to warning signals. They're more successful at regulating their feelings of desire or excitement. Introverts are much better at making a plan, staying with a plan, being very disciplined. Extroverts are characterized by their tendency to seek rewards, from top dog status to sexual highs to cold cash. They've been found to have greater economic, political, and hedonistic ambitions than introverts; even their sociability is a function of reward-sensitivity, according to this view-extroverts socialize because human connection is inherently gratifying. What underlies all this reward-seeking? The key seems to be positive emotion. Extroverts tend to experience more pleasure and excitement than introverts do-emotions that are activated. in response to the pursuit or capture of some resource that is valued. Excitement builds towards the anticipated capture of that resource. Joy follows its capture. Of sixty-four traders at an investment bank, the highest-performing traders tended to be emotionally stable introverts. Introverts also seem to be better than extroverts at delaying gratification. Extroverts are better than introverts at handling information overload. Introverts' reflectiveness uses up a lot of cognitive capacity. ""It's not that I'm so smart,"" said Einstein, who was a consummate introvert. ""It's that I stay with problems longer."" Introverts think before they act, digest information thoroughly, stay on task longer, give up less easily, and work more accurately. If you are reward-oriented: 1. When I get something I want, I feel excited and energized. 2. When I want something, I usually go all out to get it. 3. When I see an opportunity for something I like, I get excited right away. 4. When good things happen to me, it affects me strongly. 5. I have very few fears compared to my friends. In a state of flow, you're neither bored nor anxious, and you don't question your own adequacy. Flow often occurs in conditions in which people become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide rewards to herself. There are some activities that are not about approach or avoidance, but about something deeper: the fulfillment that comes from absorption in an activity outside yourself. Warren Buffett takes pride not only in his track record, but also in following his own ""inner scorecard."" He divides the world into people who focus on their own instincts and those who follow the herd. ""I feel like I'm on my back, and there's the Sistine Chapel, and I'm painting away. I like it when people say, `Gee, that's a pretty good-looking painting.' But it's my painting, and when somebody says, `Why don't you use more red instead of blue?' Good-bye. It's my painting. And I don't care what they sell it for. The painting itself will never be finished. That's one of the great things about it."" Shy and sensitive children are shunned by their peers in Canada but make sought-after playmates in China, where they are also more likely than other children to be considered for leadership roles. Chinese children who are sensitive and reticent are said to be dongshi (understanding), a common term of praise. ""Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know."" -LAO ZI, The Way of Lao Zi Individuals in Asia see themselves as part of a greater whole-whether family, corporation, or community-and place tremendous value on harmony within their group. They often subordinate their own desires to the group's interests, accepting their place in its hierarchy. Western culture, by contrast, is organized around the individual. We see ourselves as self-contained units; our destiny is to express ourselves, to follow our bliss, to be free of undue restraint, to achieve the one thing that we, and we alone, were brought into this world to do. We may be gregarious, but we don't submit to group will, or at least we don't like to think we do. We love and respect our parents, but bridle at notions like filial piety, with their implications of subordination and restraint. When we get together with others, we do so as self-contained units having fun with, competing with, standing out from, jockeying for position with, and, yes, loving, other self-contained units. Westerners value boldness and verbal skill, traits that promote individuality, while Asians prize quiet, humility, and sensitivity, which foster group cohesion. If you live in a collective, then things will go a lot more smoothly if you behave with restraint, even submission. It's because of relationship honoring, for example, that social anxiety disorder in Japan, known as taijin kyofusho, takes the form not of excessive worry about embarrassing oneself, as it does in the United States, but of embarrassing others. Hiroshima victims apologized to each other for surviving. In Asian cultures, there's often a subtle way to get what you want. It's not always aggressive, but it can be very determined and very skillful. In the end, much is achieved because of it. Aggressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over. Gandhi's passivity was not weakness at all. It meant focusing on an ultimate goal and refusing to divert energy to unnecessary skirmishes along the way. I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts. A thoughtless word hardly ever escaped my tongue or pen. Experience has taught me that silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth. We find so many people impatient to talk. All this talking can hardly be said to be of any benefit to the world. Introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly. I don't really like being the guest at someone else's party, because then I have to be entertaining. But I'll host parties because it puts you at the center of things without actually being a social person. Pay attention to what you envy. Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth. You mostly envy those who have what you desire. You can even create a restorative niche during a meeting, by carefully selecting where you sit, and when and how you participate. Be away from the center. That little bit of physical distance felt more comfortable to me, and let me read the room and comment from a perspective ever so slightly removed. It's a Free Trait Agreement when you attend your extroverted best friend's wedding shower, engagement celebration, and bachelorette party, but she understands when you skip out on the three days' worth of group activities leading up to the wedding itself. Introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with. Venting doesn't soothe anger; it fuels it. We're best off when we don't allow ourselves to go to our angry place. People who use Botox, which prevents them from making angry faces, seem to be less anger-prone than those who don't, because the very act of frowning triggers the amygdala to process negative emotions. Extroverts are sociable because their brains are good at handling competing demands on their attention-which is just what dinner-party conversation involves. In contrast, introverts often feel repelled by social events that force them to attend to many people at once. A coach: ""I'd ask a hundred questions in a row. I could manage the entire conversation just by asking the right questions. I try to tune in to the radio station of the person I'm working with. I pay attention to the energy they exude."" We all write our life stories as if we were novelists, McAdams believes, with beginnings, conflicts, turning points, and endings. And the way we characterize our past setbacks profoundly influences how satisfied we are with our current lives. Unhappy people tend to see setbacks as contaminants that ruined an otherwise good thing (""I was never the same again after my wife left me""), while generative adults see them as blessings in disguise (""The divorce was the most painful thing that ever happened to me, but I'm so much happier with my new wife"").","Any introvert should like this book. Wonderful info and insights about introversion. It'll help you defend your preference for low-stimulus environments. Since reading it, I feel better about insisting on my quiet/alone time."
Do the Work,Steven Pressfield,1936719010,9,"Any act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity --OR-- any act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these acts will elicit Resistance. Resistance is a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work. Resistance will unfailingly point to true North - meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing. We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or purpose that we must follow before all others. Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul’s evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it. Fear doesn’t go away. The battle must be fought anew every day. Next to Resistance, rational thought is the artist or entrepreneur’s worst enemy. The problem with friends and family is that they know us as we are. They are invested in maintaining us as we are. The last thing we want is to remain as we are. Prepare yourself to make new friends. Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur’s indispensable allies. Clueless enough to have no idea how difficult her enterprise is going to be - and cocky enough to believe she can pull it off anyway. How do we achieve this state of mind? By staying stupid. By not allowing ourselves to think. A child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It’s only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate. Don’t think. Act. We can always revise and revisit once we’ve acted. But we can accomplish nothing until we act. When is the best time to start? Start Before You’re Ready. Don’t prepare. Begin. The enemy is our chattering brain, which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, and a million reasons why we can’t/shouldn’t/won’t do what we know we need to do. Courage begets more courage. Research can become Resistance. Conception occurs at the primal level. It is better to be primitive than to be sophisticated, and better to be stupid than to be smart. Better to have written a lousy ballet than to have composed no ballet at all. A trick that screenwriters use: work backwards. Begin at the finish. If you’re writing a movie, solve the climax first. If you’re opening a restaurant, begin with the experience you want the diner to have when she walks in and enjoys a meal. Figure out where you want to go; then work backwards from there. End first, then beginning and middle. That’s your startup, that’s your plan I was thirty years old before I had an actual thought. Everything up till then was either what Buddhists call “monkey-mind” chatter or the reflexive regurgitation of whatever my parents or teachers said, or whatever I saw on the news or read in a book, or heard somebody rap about, hanging around the street corner. In this book, when I say “Don’t think,” what I mean is: don’t listen to the chatter. Pay no attention to those rambling, disjointed images and notions that drift across the movie screen of your mind. Those are not your thoughts. They are chatter. They are Resistance. Its aim is to reconcile you to “the way it is,” to make you exactly like everyone else, to render you amenable to societal order and discipline. Where do our own real thoughts come from? How can we access them? From what source does our true, authentic self speak? Answering that is the work you and I will do for the rest of our lives. Remember our three mantras: Stay primitive. Trust the soup. Swing for the seats. And our final-final precept: 4. Be ready for Resistance. When you and I set out to create anything - art, commerce, science, love - or to advance in the direction of a higher, nobler version of ourselves, we uncork from the universe, ineluctably, an equal and opposite reaction. That reaction is Resistance. Resistance is an active, intelligent, protean, malign force - tireless, relentless, and inextinguishable - whose sole object is to stop us from becoming our best selves and from achieving our higher goals. The universe is not indifferent. It is actively hostile. Every principle espoused so far in this volume is predicated upon that truth. The aim of every axiom set forth thus far is to outwit, outflank, outmaneuver Resistance. We can never eliminate Resistance. It will never go away. But we can outsmart it, and we can enlist allies that are as powerful as it is. One thing we can never, never permit ourselves to do is to take Resistance lightly, to underestimate it or to fail to take it into account. A feature film should have seven or eight major sequences. That’s a pretty good guideline for our play, our album, our State of the Union address. A video game should have seven or eight major movements; so should the newest high-tech gadget, or the latest fighter plane. Our new house should have seven or eight major spaces. When movie writers pitch a project, they boil down their presentation to the following: A killer opening scene Two major set pieces in the middle A killer climax A concise statement of the theme In other words, they’re filling in the gaps. The major beats. One rule for first full working drafts: get them done ASAP. Don’t worry about quality. Act, don’t reflect. Momentum is everything. Get to THE END as if the devil himself were breathing down your neck and poking you in the butt with his pitchfork. Believe me, he is. Don’t stop. Don’t look down. Don’t think. Suspend All Self-Judgment Act, reflect. Act, reflect. NEVER act and reflect at the same time. “Action” means putting words on paper. “Reflection” means evaluating what we have on paper. Forget rational thought. Play. Play like a child. Why does this purely instinctive, intuitive method work? Because our idea (our song, our ballet, our new Tex-Mex restaurant) is smarter than we are. Our job is not to control our idea; our job is to figure out what our idea is (and wants to be) - and then bring it into being. The song we’re composing already exists in potential. Our work is to find it. Read Bob Dylan’s Chronicles. The lengths he goes to to find a song (or an arrangement or a producing partner) are beyond insanity. He does it all by instinct. Fearless, child-like, primitive instinct. When an idea pops into our head and we think, “No, this is too crazy,” … that’s the idea we want. Stephen King has confessed that he works every day. How much time can you spare each day? For that interval, close the door and - short of a family emergency or the outbreak of World War III - don’t let ANYBODY in. Keep working. Keep working. Keep working. Keep At least twice a week, I pause in the rush of work and have a meeting with myself. (If I were part of a team, I’d call a team meeting.) I ask myself, again, of the project: “What is this damn thing about?” Keep refining your understanding of the theme; keep narrowing it down. “What is this project about?” “What is its theme?” “Is every element serving that theme?” Ask yourself, “What’s missing?” Then fill that gap. There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. “It will kill you. It will kill you like cancer.” This enemy is intelligent, protean, implacable, inextinguishable, and utterly ruthless and destructive. Its aim is not to obstruct or to hamper or to impede. Its aim is to kill. This Enemy Is Inside You all those off-court forces, like fame and ego (not to mention crazed fans, the press, agents, sponsors, and ex-wives), that worked against the players’ chances for on-court success. He called these forces “peripheral opponents.” Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. It does not arise from rivals, bosses, spouses, children, terrorists, lobbyists, or political adversaries. It comes from us. The Enemy Is Inside You, But It Is Not You Resistance arises second. What comes first is the idea, the passion, the dream of the work we are so excited to create that it scares the hell out of us. Resistance is the response of the frightened, petty, small-time ego to the brave, generous, magnificent impulse of the creative self. The opposite of fear is love - love of the challenge, love of the work, the pure joyous passion to take a shot at our dream and see if we can pull it off. Test Number One “How bad do you want it?” Dabbling • Interested • Intrigued but Uncertain • Passionate • Totally Committed If your answer is not the one on the far right, put this book down and throw it away. The only items you get to keep are love for the work, will to finish, and passion to serve the ethical, creative Muse. A crash means we’re at the threshold of learning something, which means we’re getting better, we’re acquiring the wisdom of our craft. A crash compels us to figure out what works and what doesn’t work - and to understand the difference. Playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.",A true manifesto. A call to action. A kick in the butt for any creative person. Great thoughts on overcoming the resistance to creating.
What Got You Here Won't Get You There,Marshall Goldsmith,1401301304,9,"A few people never need maps. They’re blessed with an internal compass that orients them automatically. They always make the correct turn and end up where they intended via the most economical route. They go through life with an unerring sense of direction. It guides them in their school years, careers, marriages, and friendships. When we meet people like this, we say they’re grounded. They know who they are and where they’re going. We feel secure around them. We feel that any surprises will only be pleasant surprises. They are our role models and heroes. This very confident CEO has a bad habit of verbalizing any and every internal monologue in his head. The higher up you go, the more your suggestions become orders. He thinks he’s merely tossing an idea against the wall to see if it sticks. His employees think he’s giving them a direct command. They have no idea how their behavior is coming across to the people who matter - their bosses, colleagues, subordinates, customers, and clients. People’s inner compass of correct behavior has gone out of whack. Actors stepping on a line. Writers misusing commas. Chefs leaving out a key ingredient. People who do one annoying thing repeatedly on the job - and don’t realize that this small flaw may sabotage their otherwise golden career. And, worse, they do not realize that (a) it’s happening and (b) they can fix it. First solicit “360-degree feedback” from colleagues. A comprehensive assessment of strengths and weaknesses. I confront them with what everybody really thinks about them. Assuming that they accept this information, agree that they have room to improve, and commit to changing that behavior, then I show them how to do it. I help them apologize to everyone affected by their flawed behavior and ask the same people for help in getting better. I help them advertise their efforts to get better because you have to tell people that you’re trying to change; they won’t notice it on their own. Then I help them follow up. We have an elevated opinion of our professional skills and our standing among our peers. We conveniently ignore the costly failures and time-consuming dead-ends we have created. These delusions are a direct result of success, not failure. That’s because we get positive reinforcement from our past successes, and, in a mental leap that’s easy to justify, we think that our past success is predictive of great things in our future. Confidence erases doubt, blinds us to the risks and challenges in our work. If we had a complete grip on reality, seeing every situation for exactly what it is, we wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning. But our delusions become a serious liability when we need to change. When someone tries to make us change our ways we think the other party is misinformed and don’t know what they’re talking about. The criticism does not apply to us, or else we wouldn’t be so successful. We discredit the messenger. “Why is a smart guy like me listening to a loser like you?” The paradox of success: These beliefs that carried us to initial success may be holding us back in our quest to go to the next level. Successful people have one idea coursing silently through their veins and brains all day. It’s a mantra that goes like this: “I have succeeded. I have succeeded. I have succeeded.” It’s their way of telling themselves that they have the skills and talent to win and keep winning. This “I have succeeded” belief, positive as it is most times, only becomes an obstacle when behavioral change is needed. Successful people literally believe that through sheer force of personality or talent or brainpower, they can steer a situation in their direction. It may be the most central belief driving individual success. People who believe they can succeed see opportunities where others see threats. They’re not afraid of uncertainty or ambiguity. They embrace it. They want to take greater risks and achieve greater returns. Given the choice, they will always bet on themselves. Successful people tend to have a high “internal locus of control.” In other words, they do not feel like victims of fate. They see success for themselves and others as largely a function of people’s motivation and ability - not luck, random chance, or external factors. Successful people have an unflappable optimism. They not only believe that they can manufacture success, they believe it’s practically their due. As a result, successful people tend to pursue opportunities with an enthusiasm that others may find mystifying. It explains why successful people tend to be extremely busy and face the danger of overcommitment. It can be difficult for an ambitious person, with an “I will succeed” attitude, to say “no” to desirable opportunities. None of them said they were trying to “save a sinking ship.” They were overcommitted because they were “drowning in a sea of opportunity.” They think, quite logically, that since you pulled off a miracle once, you can pull it off again for them. So, opportunities are thrust at you at a pace that you have never seen before. You are not experienced or disciplined enough to say no to some of them. If you’re not careful, you’ll be overwhelmed in due course - and that which made you rise will bring about your fall. When we do what we choose to do, we are committed. When we do what we have to do, we are compliant. The more we believe that our behavior is a result of our own choices and commitments, the less likely we are to want to change our behavior. Cognitive dissonance actually works in favor of successful people when they apply it to themselves. The more we are committed to believing that something is true, the less likely we are to believe that its opposite is true, even in the face of evidence that shows we may have chosen the wrong path. It’s the reason successful people don’t buckle and waver when times get tough. Their commitment to their goals and beliefs allows them to view reality through rose-tinted glasses. Our success makes us superstitious. Almost everyone I meet is successful because of doing a lot of things right, and almost everyone I meet is successful in spite of some behavior that defies common sense. One of my greatest challenges is helping leaders see the difference, see that they are confusing “because of” and “in spite of” behaviors, and avoid this “superstition trap.” Defensive reaction number one: They refuse to accept that not all good things flow to them because of the less-than-good things they do. Defensive reaction number two: Fear of overcorrection. Executives who insist their remoteness, their inscrutable silences, their non-accessibility to their direct reports is a controlled, calculated tactic to get people to think for themselves. People will do something - including changing their behavior - only if it can be demonstrated that doing so is in their own best interests as defined by their own values. To get you to do what I want, I have to prove that doing so will benefit you. The protective shell that successful people develop over time which whispers to them, “You are right. Everyone else is wrong.” If you press people to identify the motives behind their self-interest it usually boils down to four items: money, power, status, and popularity. These are the standard payoffs for success. It’s why we will claw and scratch for a raise (money), for a promotion (power), for a bigger title and office (status). It’s why so many of us have a burning need to be liked by everyone (popularity). TWENTY HABITS THAT HOLD YOU BACK FROM THE TOP They don’t happen in a vacuum. They are transactional flaws performed by one person against others. They are: 1. Winning too much: The need to win at all costs and in all situations - when it matters, when it doesn’t, and when it’s totally beside the point. 2. Adding too much value: The overwhelming desire to add our two cents to every discussion. 3. Passing judgment: The need to rate others and impose our standards on them. 4. Making destructive comments: The needless sarcasms and cutting remarks that we think make us sound sharp and witty. 5. Starting with “No,” “But,” or “However”: The overuse of these negative qualifiers which secretly say to everyone, “I’m right. You’re wrong.” 6. Telling the world how smart we are: The need to show people we’re smarter than they think we are. 7. Speaking when angry: Using emotional volatility as a management tool. 8. Negativity, or “Let me explain why that won’t work”: The need to share our negative thoughts even when we weren’t asked. 9. Withholding information: The refusal to share information in order to maintain an advantage over others. 10. Failing to give proper recognition: The inability to praise and reward. 11. Claiming credit that we don’t deserve: The most annoying way to overestimate our contribution to any success. 12. Making excuses: The need to reposition our annoying behavior as a permanent fixture so people excuse us for it. 13. Clinging to the past: The need to deflect blame away from ourselves and onto events and people from our past; a subset of blaming everyone else. 14. Playing favorites: Failing to see that we are treating someone unfairly. 15. Refusing to express regret: The inability to take responsibility for our actions, admit we’re wrong, or recognize how our actions affect others. 16. Not listening: The most passive-aggressive form of disrespect for colleagues. 17. Failing to express gratitude: The most basic form of bad manners. 18. Punishing the messenger: The misguided need to attack the innocent who are usually only trying to help us. 19. Passing the buck: The need to blame everyone but ourselves. 20. An excessive need to be “me”: Exalting our faults as virtues simply because they’re who we are. Half the leaders I have met don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop. We get credit for doing something good. We rarely get credit for ceasing to do something bad. Yet they are flip sides of the same coin. Stopping some behavior gets no attention, but it can be as crucial as everything else we do combined. To achieve the goal of “being nicer.” All you have to do is “stop being a jerk.” All you have to do is... nothing. When someone offers a less-than-brilliant idea in a meeting, don’t criticize it. Say nothing. When someone challenges one of your decisions, don’t argue with them or make excuses. Quietly consider it and say nothing. When someone makes a helpful suggestion, don’t remind them that you already knew that. Thank them and say nothing. This is not a semantic game. The beauty of knowing what to stop - of achieving this state of inspired neutrality - is that it is so easy to do. The higher you go, the more your problems are behavioral. There’s a fine line between being competitive and overcompetitive, between winning when it counts and when no one’s counting. Winning too much is the #1 challenge because it underlies nearly every other behavioral problem. If we withhold information, it’s to give ourselves an edge over others. If we play favorites, it’s to win over allies and give “our side” an advantage. Even when you’re in the checkout line at the supermarket, you’re scouting the other lines to see which is moving faster. The need to add value: It’s common among leaders used to running the show. They still retain remnants of the top-down management style where their job was to tell everyone what to do. It is extremely difficult for successful people to listen to other people tell them something that they already know without communicating somehow that (a) “we already knew that” and (b) “we know a better way.” The problem is, you may have improved the content of my idea by 5 percent, but you’ve reduced my commitment to executing it by 50 percent, because you’ve taken away my ownership of the idea. My idea is now your idea - and I walk out of your office less enthused about it People don’t like to be critiqued, however obliquely. That’s why passing judgment is one of the more insidious ways we push people away. You are not allowed to judge any helpful comment offered by a colleague or friend or family member. No matter what you privately think of the suggestion, you must keep your thoughts to yourself, hear the person out, and say, “Thank you.” When you start a sentence with “no,” “but,” “however,” or any variation thereof, no matter how friendly your tone or how many cute mollifying phrases you throw in to acknowledge the other person’s feelings, the message to the other person is You are wrong. As he looked ahead, he spied another vessel, heading rapidly downstream toward his boat. This vessel seemed to be making every effort to hit him. He rowed furiously to get out of the way, but it didn’t seem to help. He yelled at the other vessel, “Change direction, you idiot! You are going to hit me. The river is wide. Be careful!” His screaming was to no avail. The other vessel hit his boat with a sickening thud. He was enraged as he stood up and cried out to the other vessel, “You moron! How could you manage to hit my boat in the middle of this wide river? What is wrong with you?” As he looked at the other vessel, he realized that there was no one in the other boat. He was screaming at an empty vessel that had broken free of its moorings and was going downstream with the current. The lesson is simple. There is never anyone in the other boat. When we are angry, we are screaming at an empty vessel. Intentionally withholding information is the opposite of adding value. We are deleting value. You see it in people who answer every question with a question; they believe revealing anything puts them at a disadvantage. Being bad at sharing information doesn’t mean we are willfully withholding it. The two are not exactly the same thing. But the net result is the same in the eyes of the people around us. How do you stop withholding information? Simple answer: Start sharing it. He scheduled time to debrief his assistant on what he was up to. Successful people become great leaders when they learn to shift the focus from themselves to others. If you came up with a good idea in a meeting, did it spring unbidden from your fertile imagination? Or was it inspired by an insightful comment from someone else in the room? When you hear yourself saying, “I’m sorry I’m late but the traffic was murder,” stop talking at the word “sorry.” Blaming the traffic is a lame excuse - and doesn’t excuse the fact that you kept people waiting. The next time you hear yourself saying, “I’m just no good at... ,” ask yourself, “Why not?” These are not genetic flaws! We weren’t born that way, no matter what we’ve been brought up to believe. “When I was your age...” Inevitably, it’s a self-pitying lecture that points out how difficult and miserable the parent’s childhood was in comparison with the childhood the parent is now providing for his or her children. When I was finished, she said, “Daddy, it’s not my fault you make money.” Stop blaming others for the choices you made. We can’t see in ourselves what we can see so clearly in others. If you put all your cards in someone else’s hands that person will treat you better than if you kept the cards to yourself. Benjamin Franklin said, “To gain a friend, let him do you a favor.” You are saying, “I can’t change the past. All I can say is I’m sorry for what I did wrong. I’m sorry it hurt you. There’s no excuse for it and I will try to do better in the future. I would like you to give me any ideas about how I can improve.” “Why don’t you thank her now?” I asked. “Because I want to wait. It’ll be more impressive when the job is done.” “That may be true,” I said. “But do you think she’ll resent it if you thank her now and thank her again with a bigger gesture when the job is completed? Do you think she’ll resent you for thanking her twice?” Gratitude is a skill that we can never display too often. Punishing the messenger: manifests itself in big and little ways. It’s the momentary snort of disgust you exhale when your assistant reports that the boss is too busy to see you. Each of us to cross the line and begin to make a virtue of our flaws - simply because the flaws constitute what we think of as “me.” This misguided loyalty to our true natures - this excessive need to be me - is one of the toughest obstacles to making positive long-term change The real problem is your self-limiting definition of who you are. You define phony as anything that isn’t... me! This stern allegiance to his definition of himself was pointless vanity. If he could shed his “excessive need to be me,” he wouldn’t see himself as a phony. He could stop thinking about himself and start behaving in a way that benefited others. Sure enough, when he let go of this devotion to “me,” all his other rationalizations fell by the wayside. It’s an interesting equation: Less me. More them. Equals success. Keep this in mind when you find yourself resisting change because you’re clinging to a false - or pointless - notion of “me.” It’s not about you. It’s about what other people think of you. We get so wrapped up in achieving our goal that we do it at the expense of a larger mission. It comes from misunderstanding what we want in our lives. Goal obsession: It’s not a flaw. It’s a creator of flaws. It’s the force that distorts our otherwise exemplary talents and good intentions, turning them into something we no longer admire. They were chasing the spotlight. They were under pressure! They were in a hurry! They had deadlines! They were going to do something that they thought was important! Other people were depending upon them! These are the classic conditions that can lead to goal obsession. Reflect upon our work, match it up against the life we want to live, and consider, “What am I doing?” and, “Why am I doing this?” INFORMATION COMPULSION: People have an overwhelming need to tell you something that you don’t know, even when it’s not in their best interest. Journalists would have a hard time surviving without information compulsion. People wouldn’t call them with tips on a good story, or agree to be interviewed, or spill secrets about their company, or hand out delicious quotes. The same compulsion blossoms into full flower in our daily lives. It’s the reason we like to dazzle our friends at dinner parties with the esoterica we know (even when we suspect we may be overstaying our welcome), or why coworkers like to gossip around the water cooler (even when they know that their chatter may get back to the people they’re prattling about), or why friends tell us in excessive detail about their health or their love lives (even though they close their ears when the tables are turned). It’s the reason “that’s too much information” has entered everyday speech. We all have an overwhelming need to display and share what we know. And we do it excessively. Study the twenty annoying habits and you’ll see that at least half of them are rooted in information compulsion. When we add value, or pass judgment, or make destructive comments, or announce that we “already knew that,” or explain “why that won’t work” we are compulsively sharing information. We’re telling people something they don’t know. We’re convinced that we’re making people smarter or inspiring them to do better, when we’re more likely to achieve the opposite effect. There’s nothing wrong with that. The world would be a more dangerous and less interesting place if we didn’t understand how to either share information or withhold it. It’s good to share information that helps people. Likewise, it’s good to withhold it when it harms people (that’s why many secrets should be kept). The same goes for emotion. Worth sharing sometimes. Other times, not worth it at all. The key to your job is client selection. You ‘qualify’ your clients to the point where you almost can’t fail. The deck is totally stacked in your favor. That’s what I do here. If I have the right people around me, I’m fine. One of the defining traits of habitual winners: They stack the deck in their favor. And they’re unabashed about it. They do this when they hire the best candidates for a job rather than settle for an almost-the-best type. They do this when they pay whatever it takes to retain a valuable employee rather than lose him or her to the competition. They do this when they’re fully prepared for a negotiation rather than winging it. If you study successful people, you’ll discover that their stories are not so much about overcoming enormous obstacles and handicaps but rather about avoiding high-risk, low-reward situations and doing everything in their power to increase the odds in their favor. I often have a hard time convincing successful people that not everything needs improving. Successful people have a glaring tendency to overcommit. If you outline seven flaws, they’ll want to tackle all of them. Five reasons people do not succeed with their diet and fitness goals. They mistakenly estimate: • Time: It takes a lot longer than they expected. They don’t have time to do it. • Effort: It’s harder than they expected. It’s not worth all the effort. • Distractions: They do not expect a “crisis” to emerge that will prevent them from staying with the program. • Rewards: After they see some improvement, they don’t get the response from others that they expected. People don’t immediately love the new improved person they’ve become. • Maintenance: Once they hit their goal, people forget how hard it is to stay in shape. Not expecting that they’ll have to stick with the program for life, they slowly backslide or give up completely. I have learned a hard lesson trying to help real people, change real behavior in the real world. There is no “couple of weeks.” Look at the trend line! Sanity does not prevail. There is a good chance that tomorrow is going to be just as crazy as today. The next time you find yourself trapped by a needy, demanding staff. If they need too much of your time, you can’t just tell them to stop bothering you. You have to wean them away and make it seem like it’s their idea. Let them figure out what they should be doing on their own. Let them tell you where you’re not needed. He inspired his whole staff to get behind the suggestion. But a few days later, after he had enough time to debate his decision strenuously with himself, he’d change his mind, saying, “Maybe that wasn’t such a good idea.” In his head, he was being open-minded. In his staff’s collective brain, he was confusing them. Let’s not get into the fact that you can’t do that in a leadership position. You can’t motivate 200 people to conquer a hill and, when they all start charging, say, “Wait a minute. Maybe this isn’t such a smart plan.” You have to change 100 percent to get 10 percent credit for it. His employees did not understand the company’s mission and overall direction. “I don’t get it,” he said. “I’ve spelled it out for them in meetings. I’ve summarized it in a memo.” “Let’s review the situation,” I said. “How was this memo distributed?” “By e-mail,” he said. “It went to everyone in the company.” “Okay,” I said, “but my hunch is that the method of distribution is all you know about this. How many people actually opened the e-mail and read the memo?” “I don’t know,” he said. “Of those, how many do you think understood the memo?” “I have no idea,” he said. “Of those who understood it, how many believed it?” He shook his head. “Of this dwindling group of believers, how many remembered it?” Another sorry head shake. “That’s a lot of unknowns for something you regard as vital to your company’s existence,” “You thought your job was done when you articulated the mission and wrote the memo - as if it were one more item on your to-do list for the day. You checked the box, and you moved on.” The failure of managers to see the enormous disconnect between understanding and doing. Most leadership development revolves around one huge false assumption - that if people understand then they will do. That’s not true. Most of us understand, we just don’t do. Follow-up: Once you send out a message, you ask people the next day if they heard it. Then you ask if they understood it. Then a few days later, you ask if they did something about it. Believe me, if the first follow-up question doesn’t get their attention, the next one will, and so will the final one. The shelf life of knowledge, especially technical knowledge, is continuously shrinking. And so free agents respond by moving on to new challenges that enhance their knowledge and let them outpace the shrinking value of their experience - and in turn reward them with more satisfaction and, quite possibly, more money. People in their 20s want to learn on the job. In their 30s they want to advance. And in their 40s they want to rule. You have to find out what they want at every step - by literally asking them. The company needs the knowledge worker far more than the knowledge worker needs them. Stop trying to change people who don’t think they have a problem.","Aimed at already-successful people. The personality traits that brought you to success (personal discipline, saying yes to everything, over-confidence) are the same traits that hold you back from going further! (Where you need to listen to lead, and don't let over-confidence make you over-commit.) Stinging counter-intuitive insights that hit very close to home for me. Great specific suggestions for how to improve."
The Personal MBA,Josh Kaufman,1591843529,9,"The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble. It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it. Hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted. ROUGHLY DEFINED, A BUSINESS IS A REPEATABLE PROCESS THAT: (1) creates or provides something of value that (2) other people want or need (3) at a price they’re willing to pay, in a way that (4) satisfies the purchaser’s needs and expectations and (5) provides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation. A business is a repeatable process that makes money. Everything else is a hobby. Make someone else’s life a little bit better. Without value creation, a business can’t exist - you can’t transact with others unless you have something valuable to trade. The best businesses in the world are the ones that create the most value for other people. Some businesses thrive by providing a little value to many, and others focus on providing a lot of value to only a few people. A venture that doesn’t create value for others is a hobby. A venture that doesn’t attract attention is a flop. A venture that doesn’t sell the value it creates is a nonprofit. A venture that doesn’t deliver what it promises is a scam. A venture that doesn’t bring in enough money to keep operating will inevitably close. 1. Value Creation Discovering what people need or want, then creating it 2. Marketing Attracting attention and building demand for what you’ve created 3. Sales Turning prospective customers into paying customers 4. Value Delivery Giving your customers what you’ve promised and ensuring that they’re satisfied 5. Finance Bringing in enough money to keep going and make your effort worthwhile If these five things sound simple, it’s because they are. Business is not (and has never been) rocket science - it’s simply a process of identifying a problem and finding a way to solve it that benefits both parties. Anyone who tries to make business sound more complicated than this is either trying to impress you or trying to sell you something you don’t need. Don’t expect skills that aren’t related to the Five Parts of Every Business to be economically rewarded. Find a way to use them to create Economic Value, and you’ll inevitably find a way to get paid. Any skill or knowledge that helps you create value, market, sell, deliver value, or manage finances is Economically Valuable. Market research is the business equivalent of “look before you leap.” All successful businesses sell some combination of money, status, power, love, knowledge, protection, pleasure, and excitement. The more clearly you articulate how your product satisfies one or more of these drives, the more attractive your offer will become. RATE EACH OF THE TEN FACTORS BELOW ON A SCALE OF 0 TO 10 1. Urgency - How badly do people want or need this right now? 2. Market Size - How many people are actively purchasing things like this? 3. Pricing Potential - What is the highest price a typical purchaser would be willing to spend 4. Cost of Customer Acquisition - How easy is it to acquire a new customer? 5. Cost of Value Delivery - How much would it cost to create and deliver the value offered, both in money and effort? 6. Uniqueness of Offer - How unique is your offer versus competing offerings in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors to copy you? 7. Speed to Market - How quickly can you create something to sell? 8. Up-Front Investment - How much will you have to invest before you’re ready to sell? 9. Upsell Potential - Are there related secondary offers that you could also present to purchasing customers? 10. Evergreen Potential - Once the initial offer has been created, how much additional work will you have to put into it in order to continue selling? If there are several successful businesses serving a market, you don’t have to worry so much about investing in a dead end, since you already know that people are buying. Building or finishing anything is mostly a matter of starting over and over again; don’t ignore what pulls you. The trick is to find an attractive market that interests you enough to keep you improving your offering every single day. Some ideas don’t have enough of a market behind them to support a business, and that’s perfectly okay. That doesn’t mean you should ignore them: side projects can help you expand your knowledge, improve your skills, and experiment with new methods and techniques. TWELVE STANDARD FORMS OF VALUE 1. Product Create a single tangible item or entity, then sell and deliver it for more than what it cost to make. 2. Service Provide help or assistance, then charge a fee for the benefits rendered. 3. Shared Resource Create a durable asset that can be used by many people, then charge for access. 4. Subscription Offer a benefit on an ongoing basis, and charge a recurring fee. 5. Resale Acquire an asset from a wholesaler, then sell that asset to a retail buyer at a higher price. 6. Lease Acquire an asset, then allow another person to use that asset for a predefined amount of time in exchange for a fee. 7. Agency Market and sell an asset or service you don’t own on behalf of a third party, then collect a percentage of the transaction price as a fee. 8. Audience Aggregation Get the attention of a group of people with certain characteristics, then sell access in the form of advertising to another business looking to reach that audience. 9. Loan Lend a certain amount of money, then collect payments over a predefined period of time equal to the original loan plus a predefined interest rate. 10. Option Offer the ability to take a predefined action for a fixed period of time in exchange for a fee. 11. Insurance Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policy holder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens. 12. Capital Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend. TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SERVICE, YOUR BUSINESS MUST: 1. Have employees capable of a skill or ability other people require but can’t, won’t, or don’t want to use themselves. 2. Ensure that the Service is provided with consistently high quality. 3. Attract and retain paying customers. TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SHARED RESOURCE, YOU MUST: 1. Create an asset people want to have access to. 2. Serve as many users as you can without affecting the quality of each user’s experience. 3. Charge enough to maintain and improve the Shared Resource over time. The tricky part about offering a Shared Resource is carefully monitoring usage levels. Finding the sweet spot between too few members and too many is the key to making a Shared Resource work. TO RUN A PRODUCT-ORIENTED BUSINESS, YOU MUST: 1. Create some sort of tangible item that people want. 2. Produce that item as inexpensively as possible while maintaining an acceptable level of quality. 3. Sell as many units as possible for as high a price as the market will bear. 4. Keep enough inventory of finished product available to fulfill orders as they come in. TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST: 1. Provide significant value to each subscriber on a regular basis. 2. Build a subscriber base and continually attract new subscribers to compensate for attrition. 3. Bill customers on a recurring basis. 4. Retain each subscriber as long as possible. The key to Subscription offers is doing everything you can to keep customer attrition as low as possible. TO PROVIDE VALUE AS A RESELLER, YOU MUST: 1. Purchase a product as inexpensively as possible, usually in bulk. 2. Keep the product in good condition until sale - damaged goods can’t be sold. 3. Find potential purchasers of the product as quickly as possible to keep inventory costs low. 4. Sell the product for as high a markup as possible, preferably a multiple of the purchase price. Resellers are valuable because they help wholesalers sell products without having to find individual purchasers. As long as an asset is durable enough to survive rental to another person and return ready for reuse, you can Lease it. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA A LEASE, YOU MUST: 1. Acquire an asset people want to use. 2. Lease the asset to a paying customer on favorable terms. 3. Protect yourself from unexpected or adverse events, including the loss or damage of the leased asset. TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA AGENCY, YOU MUST: 1. Find a seller who has a valuable asset. 2. Establish contact and trust with potential buyers of that asset. 3. Negotiate until an agreement is reached on the terms of sale. 4. Collect the agreed-upon fee or commission from the seller. “So long as there’s a jingle in your head, television isn’t free.” - Jason Love, marketing executive TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA AUDIENCE AGGREGATION, YOU MUST: 1. Identify a group of people with common characteristics or interests. 2. Create and maintain some way of consistently attracting that group’s attention. 3. Find third parties who are interested in buying the attention of that audience. 4. Sell access to that audience without alienating the audience itself. TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA LOANS, YOU MUST: 1. Have some amount of money to lend. 2. Find people who want to borrow that money. 3. Set an interest rate that compensates you adequately for the Loan. 4. Estimate and protect against the possibility that the Loan won’t be repaid. TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA OPTIONS, YOU MUST: 1. Identify some action people might want to take in the future. 2. Offer potential buyers the right to take that action before a specified deadline. 3. Convince potential buyers that the Option is worth the asking price. 4. Enforce the specified deadline on taking action. Concert tickets, coupons, retainers, and licensing rights are all examples of Options. In exchange for a fee, the purchaser has the right to take some specific action - attend the show, purchase an asset, or buy a financial security at a particular price - before the deadline. Options are valuable because they allow the purchaser the ability to take a specific action without requiring them to take that action. Options are often used to keep specific courses of action open for a certain period of time before another transaction takes place. Options are often an overlooked form of value - flexibility is one of the Three Universal Currencies. Find a way to give people more flexibility, and you may discover a viable business model. TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA INSURANCE, YOU MUST: 1. Create a binding legal agreement that transfers the risk of a specific bad thing (a “loss”) happening from the policy holder to you. 2. Estimate the risk of that bad thing actually happening, using available data. 3. Collect the agreed-upon series of payments (called “premiums”) over time. 4. Pay out legitimate claims upon the policy. “Capital is that part of wealth which is devoted to obtaining further wealth.” - Alfred Marshall, economist and author of principles of economics TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA CAPITAL, YOU MUST: 1. Have a pool of resources available to invest. 2. Find a promising business in which you’d be willing to invest. 3. Estimate how much that business is currently worth, how much it may be worth in the future, and the probability that the business will go under, which would result in the loss of your Capital. 4. Negotiate the amount of ownership you’d receive in exchange for the amount of Capital you’re investing. A homeowner may be willing to pay a maximum one-time fee of $50 for a pool cleaning kit, but they’d be willing to pay $250 a month to have someone clean their pool every week for them. The pool gets cleaned either way, but the weekly cleaning service has a higher perceived value because the pool owner doesn’t have to spend any time or effort to get the same desired result. COMBINATIONS: Travel Web sites like Orbitz sell Products (airplane tickets) alongside trip-cancellation Insurance, and display advertising (Audience Aggregation) to Web site visitors. Movie theaters combine movie showings (a Shared Resource ) with tickets (an Option) and concession sales (Products). In most companies, each of these offers is handled separately, and the customer can pick and choose which offers they want to take advantage of. By making offers Modular, the business can create and improve each offer in isolation, then mix and match offers as necessary to better serve their customers. ITERATION HAS SIX MAJOR STEPS: 1. Watch - What’s happening? What’s working and what’s not? 2. Ideate - What could you improve? What are your options? 3. Guess - Based on what you’ve learned so far, which of your ideas do you think will make the biggest impact? 4. Which? - Decide which change to make. 5. Act - Actually make the change. 6. Measure - What happened? Was the change positive or negative? Should you keep the change, or go back to how things were before this iteration? Define what you’re trying to accomplish with each iteration. When creating a new offering, your primary goal should be to work your way through each Iteration Cycle as quickly as possible. Iteration is a structured form of learning that helps you make your offering better; the faster you learn, the more quickly you’ll be able to improve. “No business plan survives first contact with customers.” - Steve Blank Getting useful Feedback from your potential customers is the core of the Iteration Cycle. Ask open-ended questions. Encourage the other person to do most of the talking. Short who/what/when/where/why/how questions typically work best. Watch what they do. Give potential customers the opportunity to preorder. A successful business is either loved or needed. By paying attention to the Patterns behind what your best customers value, you’ll be able to focus on improving your offering for most of your best potential customers most of the time. Two primary characteristics: convenience and fidelity. Things that are quick, reliable, easy, and flexible are convenient. Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal, or emotional impact are high-fidelity. Almost every improvement you make to an offer can be thought of in terms of improving either convenience or fidelity. It’s incredibly difficult to optimize for both fidelity and convenience at the same time, so the most successful offerings try to provide the most convenience or fidelity among all competing offerings. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE TEST The participant is shown a bunch of traits, and asked the following questions: 1. Which of these items is most important? 2. Which of these items is least important? Once the participant answers the questions, another set is shown: E. Unique entrées I can’t get anywhere else F. Knowing I can always order my favorite dishes G. People are impressed that I dine here H. Large portions. Random question sets containing four or five criteria are provided until there are no more possible combinations or the participant’s attention wanders, which will typically occur around the five- to ten-minute mark. By asking the participant to make an actual choice, you’re collecting more accurate information about how the participant would respond when faced with a similar choice in the real world. Critically Important Assumptions (CIAs) are facts or characteristics that must be true in the real world for your business or offering to be successful. Every new business or offering has a set of CIAs, and if any CIA turns out to be false, the business idea will be vastly less promising than it appears. The same day they announced the Fitbit idea to the world, they started allowing customers to preorder a Fitbit on their Web site, based on little more than a description of what the device would do and a few renderings of what the product would look like. The billing system collected names, addresses, and verified credit card numbers, but no charges were actually processed until the product was ready to ship, which gave the company an out in case their plans fell through. Orders started rolling in, and one month later, investors had the confidence to pony up $2 million dollars to make the Fitbit a reality. A year later, the first real Fitbit was shipped to customers. If you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. Pick three key attributes or features, get those things very, very right, and then forget about everything else. By focusing on only a few core features in the first version, you are forced to find the true essence and value of the product. Incremental Augmentation is the process of using the Iteration Cycle to add new benefits to an existing offer. The process is simple: keep making and testing additions to the core offer, continue doing what works, and stop doing what doesn’t. Spending time and energy acting like a socialite reduces the amount of resources you can devote to creating real value for your customers. Advertising is the tax you pay for being unremarkable. People don’t buy quarter-inch drills; they buy quarter-inch holes. The product that will not sell without advertising will not sell profitably with advertising. If you’re the type of person Progressive wants as a customer, they’ll quote you a price and encourage you to purchase an insurance policy immediately. If you’re not, Progressive will tell you that you can get a better price elsewhere and actively encourage you to purchase insurance from one of their competitors. Screening your customers can help you filter out the bad customers before they do business with you. The more clearly you define your ideal customer, the better you can screen out the prospects who don’t fit that description, and the more you’ll be able to focus on serving your best customers well. Your job as a marketer isn’t to convince people to want what you’re offering: it’s to help your prospects convince themselves that what you’re offering will help them get what they really want. Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. - Marcus Aurelius A good story will make even the best offer even better. The Hero’s Journey begins by introducing the Hero: a normal person who is experiencing the trials and tribulations of everyday life. The Hero then receives a “call to adventure”: a challenge, quest, or responsibility that requires them to rise above their normal existence and hone their skills and abilities in order to prevail. When the Hero accepts the call, they depart their normal experience and enter into a world of uncertainty and adventure. A series of remarkable experiences initiates them into the new world, and the Hero undergoes many trials and learns many secrets in the pursuit of ultimate success. After persevering in the face of adversity and vanquishing the foe, the Hero receives a mighty gift or power, then returns to the normal world to share this knowledge, wisdom, or treasure with the people. In return, the Hero receives the respect and admiration of all. Your customers want to be Heroes. Telling a story about people who have already walked the path your prospects are considering is a powerful way to make them interested in proceeding. Testimonials, case studies, and other stories are extremely effective in encouraging your prospects to accept your “call to adventure.” “If you want an audience, start a fight.” - Irish proverb Controversy provokes a discussion. Discussion is Attention. Controversy with a purpose is valuable; Controversy for the sake of Controversy, or Controversy that belittles and demeans, is not. The market’s perception becomes your reality. The best businesses in the world earn the trust of their prospects and help them understand why the offer is worth paying for. No one wants to make a bad decision or be taken advantage of, so sales mostly consists of helping the prospect understand what’s important and convincing them you’re capable of actually delivering on what you promise. “There is only one boss: the customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else.” - Sam Walton Make your first profitable Transaction as quickly as you possibly can, because that’s the point where you transition from being a project to being a business. Compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece. If you expect people to pay you perfectly good money to buy what you’re offering, you must be able to provide a Reason Why the offered price is worth paying. There are four ways to support a price on something of value: (1) replacement cost (2) market comparison (3) discounted cash flow/net present value (4) value comparison. These Four Pricing Methods will help you estimate just how much something is potentially worth to your customers. The Replacement Cost method supports a price by answering the question “How much would it cost to replace?” The Market Comparison method supports a price by answering the question “How much are other things like this selling for?” The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) / Net Present Value (NPV) method supports a price by answering the question “How much is it worth if it can bring in money over time?” You can use the DCF/NPV formulas to calculate what that series of payments over a certain period of time would be worth if you received it in one lump sum. Find the formulas at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow DCF/NPV is only used for pricing things that can produce an ongoing cash flow, which makes it a very common way to price businesses when they’re sold or acquired - the more profit the business generates each month, the more valuable the business is to the purchaser. The Value Comparison method supports a price by answering the question “Who is this particularly valuable to?” By looking at the unique characteristics of what you’re offering and the corresponding worth of those characteristics to certain individuals, you can often support much higher prices. Value Comparison is typically the optimal way to price your offer, since the value of an offer to a specific group can be quite high, resulting in a much better price. Use the other methods as a baseline, but focus on discovering how much your offer is worth to the party you hope to sell it to, then set your price appropriately. Imagine that you provide an ongoing service to a Fortune 50 corporation that increases their annual revenues by $100 million. Is your service worth $10 million a year? Sure - after all, what company would give up $90 million in ongoing revenue? Does it matter if providing this valuable service doesn’t cost you much money? Absolutely not - even if it only costs you a hundred dollars a year to provide the service, you’re providing a huge amount of value, which supports the comparatively high price. Does it matter if most business-to-business services cost $10,000 or less? Absolutely not - you’re providing much more value than other services in the market, which completely justifies a higher price. Value-Based Selling is the process of understanding and reinforcing the Reasons Why your offer is valuable to the purchaser. By understanding and reinforcing the Reason Why a Transaction will be valuable to the customer, you simultaneously increase the likelihood of a Transaction as well as the price the buyer will be willing to pay. Value-Based Selling is not about talking - it’s about listening. In the classic sales book SPIN Selling, Neil Rackham describes the four phases of successful selling: (1) understanding the situation (2) defining the problem (3) clarifying the short-term and long-term implications of that problem (4) quantifying the need-payoff, or the financial and emotional benefits the customer would experience after the resolution of their problem. Instead of barging in with a premature, boilerplate hard sell, successful salespeople focus on asking detailed questions to get to the root of what the prospect really wants. “Upgrade your user, not your product. Value is less about the stuff and more about the stuff the stuff enables. Don’t build better cameras - build better photographers.” - Kathy Sierra The other party always has a Next Best Alternative as well - that’s what you’re negotiating against. If you’re selling a product that costs $100, you are selling against the next best thing that they could do with that $100: saving, investing, or purchasing something else. Understanding the other party’s Next Best Alternative gives you a major sales advantage: you can structure your agreement so it’s more attractive than their next best option. In every negotiation, there are Three Universal Currencies: resources, time, and flexibility. Any one of these currencies can be traded for more or less of the others. Reciprocation makes it more likely that the buyer will “pay back” the favor with a much larger concession. The more legitimate value you can provide to others up front, the more receptive they’ll be when it’s time for your pitch. Your prospects know you’re not perfect, so don’t pretend to be. People actually get suspicious when something appears to be “too good to be true.” If an offer appears abnormally good, your prospects will start asking themselves, “What’s the catch?” Instead of making them wonder, tell them yourself. Offer a very strong Risk-Reversing guarantee and to extend the risk-free period as much as possible. If you cancel a Netflix subscription, three to six months later you’ll receive a postcard or e-mail from Netflix with an offer to resubscribe at a reduced rate. If you don’t reply, they’ll send another message every few months until you resubscribe or request to be removed completely. Reactivation campaigns are consistently the easiest and most profitable marketing activities you’ll ever try. Value Stream is the set of all steps and all processes from the start of your Value Creation process all the way through the delivery of the end result to your customer. Toyota Production System (TPS) was the first large-scale manufacturing operation to systematically examine its entire Value Stream on a regular basis. Analyzing the production system in great detail paved the way for an ongoing series of small, incremental improvements: Toyota engineers make over 1 million improvements to the TPS each year. The best way to understand your Value Stream is to diagram it. Tracing the steps or transformations your offer goes through from the beginning to the end is an extremely enlightening process. Make your Value Stream as small and efficient as possible. The Expectation Effect: Quality = Performance - Expectations. When you order from Zappos, it’s very likely that you’ll receive a pleasant surprise: your shoes will arrive the next day, several days ahead of schedule. Zappos could easily advertise “free expedited shipping,” but they don’t - the surprise is far more valuable. The performance of the offering must surpass the customer’s expectations in order for them to be satisfied. How did two young guys break into a competitive market against contractors who have been in business longer than they’ve been alive? Simple: when you hire Aaron and Pat, you can be absolutely certain the job will be done right and on time. Contractors are notoriously unpredictable: they often show up late, take too long, do sloppy work, and have bad attitudes. The secret of Aaron and Pat’s success is Predictability - they do great work every single time, deliver on schedule, and they’re always pleasant to work with. As a result, they’re booked solid. Violating the expectations of loyal customers is not the way to success - if you’re offering something completely different, present it as something new. The best way to begin increasing Throughput is to start measuring it. How long does it take for your business system to produce a dollar of profit? How long does it take to produce another unit to sell, or a new happy customer? There’s an upper limit on what any single business system can produce. By creating more identical business systems based on a proven model, Multiplication can expand a business’s ability to deliver value to more customers. That’s the major benefit of franchising: instead of reinventing a business model, opening a franchise helps Multiply a model that already works. The easier it is to Multiply your business system, the more value you can ultimately deliver. The less human involvement required to create and deliver value, the more Scalable the business. “Don’t compete with rivals - make them irrelevant.” - W. Chan Kim, Blue Ocean Strategy The only good use of debt or outside capital in setting up a system is to give you access to Force Multipliers you would not be able to access any other way. Always choose the best tools that you can obtain and afford. Quality tools give you maximum output with a minimum of input. By investing in Force Multipliers, you free up your time, energy, and attention to focus on building your business instead of simply operating it. “If you can’t describe what you are doing as a process, you don’t know what you’re doing.” - W. Edwards Deming Most people resist creating business systems because it feels like extra work. We’re all busy, and it’s easy to feel like you don’t have time to create and improve systems because there’s already too much work to do. Finance is the art and science of watching the money flowing into and out of a business, then deciding how to allocate it and determining whether or not what you’re doing is producing the results you want. It’s really not any more complicated than that. Yes, there can be fancy models and jargon, but ultimately you’re simply using numbers to decide whether or not your business is operating the way you intended, and whether or not the results are enough. When a business tries to maximize revenue by “nickel-and-diming” their customers or trying to capture too much value, customers flee. There are only four ways to increase your business’s revenue: ▶ Increase the number of customers you serve. ▶ Increase the average size of each Transaction by selling more. ▶ Increase the frequency of transactions per customer. ▶ Raise your prices. Always focus the majority of your efforts on serving your ideal customers. Your ideal customers buy early, buy often, spend the most, spread the word, and are willing to pay a premium for the value you provide. The moment you make a mistake in pricing, you’re eating into your reputation or your profits. The purpose of a customer isn’t to get a sale. The purpose of a sale is to get a customer. All truth is found in the cash account. The Time Value of Money can help you figure out the maximum you should be willing to pay for a business that earns $200,000 in profit each year. Assuming an interest rate of 5 percent, no growth, and a foreseeable future of ten years, the “present value” of that series of future cash flows is $1,544,347. If you pay less than that amount, you’ll come out ahead. Improve by 1% a day, and in just 70 days, you’re twice as good. Bonds are debt sold to individual lenders. Instead of asking a bank for a loan directly, the business asks individuals or other companies to loan them money directly. Bond purchasers give money directly to the business, which is paid back at an agreed-upon rate for a certain amount of time. When the time expires (i.e., the Bond “matures”), the company must give back the original loan amount in addition to the payments already made. Receivables Financing can make millions of dollars in credit available, but at a cost: the collateral for the loan is control over the business’s receivables. Since the bank controls the receivables, they can ensure their loan is paid before anything else, including employee salaries and vendor commitments. If you’re grasping for the brass ring - becoming obscenely wealthy by building a massive public company - you’ll probably need financing. If your intent is to be self-sufficient and free to make your own decisions, it’s much better to avoid financing in favor of retaining control. Bootstrapping is the art of building and operating a business without Funding. Forebrain: This small sheet of neural matter is responsible for the cognitive capabilities that make us distinctly human: self-awareness, logic, deliberation, Inhibition, and Decision. Developmentally speaking, the forebrain is very new, and likely evolved to help us handle ambiguity. Most of the time, our midbrain and hindbrain run the show - we’re operating on instinct and autopilot. That changes, however, when we face something unexpected or unfamiliar, which confounds the midbrain’s ability to predict what will happen next. That’s when the forebrain kicks into gear, gathering data and considering options. After some deliberation and analysis, the forebrain decides what to do based on what appears to be best at the time. Once a Decision is made, the midbrain and hindbrain assume normal operation and carry out the decision. One of the best things you can do to get more done is to dissociate yourself from the voice in your head. Meditation is a simple practice that can help you separate “you” from the voice in your head. There’s nothing mystical or magical about meditation - you simply breathe and watch what your “monkey mind” does without associating yourself with it. After a while, the voice becomes quieter, improving your ability to keep yourself on the course you choose. Action comes about if and only if we find a discrepancy between what we are experiencing and what we want to experience. Whenever an individual or a business decides that success has been attained, progress stops. Researchers have studied marathoners and ultramarathoners (people who regularly run fifty to one hundred miles at a stretch) to learn more about how the body responds to pain. Here’s what they’ve found: when you’re so tired that it feels like you’re about to kick the bucket any second, physiologically, you’re not even remotely close to actually dying. The signals your brain is sending to your body are a ruse that serves as a warning, prompting you to keep some energy in reserve, just in case energy is needed later. If you think your weight, health, and physique are just fine, you probably won’t change your diet or start exercising spontaneously. If you’re comfortable with your social circle and confidence, you probably won’t do much to improve your social skills or expand your circle of acquaintances. If you think you’re making enough money, you probably won’t do much to earn more. Good books, magazines, blogs, documentaries, and even competitors are valuable if they violate your expectations about what’s possible. When you discover that other people are actually doing something you previously considered unrealistic or impossible, it changes your Reference Levels in a very useful way. All you need to know is that something you want is possible, and you’ll find a way to get it. Reorganization is random action that occurs when a Reference Level is violated but you don’t know what to do to bring the perception back under control. The “quarter-life” or midlife crisis many people experience is a perfect example of Reorganization. You don’t quite know what to do to eliminate the angst you’re feeling, so you start doing things that aren’t normal for you, like quitting your job to backpack across Europe or getting a tattoo and buying a motorcycle. Reorganization feels like you’re lost, depressed, or crazy - that’s completely normal. Your brain starts spitting out all kinds of off-the-wall things in an effort to find something to fix the situation. Reorganization is the neurological basis of learning. If your mind hasn’t already learned what to do in a certain situation, the best way to solve the problem is to try new things in an effort to gather data. That’s what Reorganization is for - it’s the impulse to consider or try new things to see what works. It’s best not to fight it. Resisting or repressing the impulse to try something different slows down your learning. Some perception about your life is out of control, and Reorganization is required to gather more data about how to fix it. Once you learn how to bring the perception back under control, Reorganization stops naturally. Change your beliefs and Mental Simulations consciously by recalling and actively Reinterpreting past events. Willpower can be thought of as instinctual override - it’s a way to interrupt our automatic processing in order to do something else. Our ability to successfully use Willpower for self-control tasks is dependent on a physiological fuel: blood glucose. Acts of Willpower Deplete relatively large amounts of glucose, and when those stores run low, we have a hard time using Willpower to inhibit behavior. The best way to use your limited reserves of Willpower is to use Guiding Structure to change the structure of your Environment instead of your behavior. The ostentatious buildings on the Las Vegas Strip are enormous monuments to human stupidity. Imagine that, thirty or forty years from now, your grandchild gives you feedback on the results of your decision. Will they laud you for your wisdom or reprimand you for your stupidity? Here’s a curious fact about human beings: we have a really hard time realizing that something isn’t there. Great management is boring - and often unrewarding. The hallmark of an effective manager is anticipating likely issues and resolving them in advance, before they become an issue. Some of the best managers in the world look like they’re not doing much, but everything gets done on time and under budget. The problem is, no one sees all of the bad things that the great manager prevents. Less skilled managers are actually more likely to be rewarded, since everyone can see them “making things happen” and “moving heaven and earth” to resolve issues - issues they may have created themselves via poor management. Make a note to remind yourself to handsomely reward the low-drama manager who quietly and effectively gets things done. Absence Blindness makes prevention grossly underappreciated. If you’re trying to sell the absence or prevention of something, you’re fighting an uphill battle, even if your Product is great. Absence Blindness also makes it uncomfortable for people to “do nothing” when something bad happens, even if doing nothing is the best course of action. Often, the best course of action is to choose not to act, but that’s often difficult for humans to accept emotionally. Experience is valuable primarily because the expert has a larger mental database of related Patterns, and thus a higher chance of noticing an absence. By noticing violations of expected Patterns, experienced people are more likely to get an “odd feeling” that things “aren’t quite right,” which is often enough warning to find an issue before it becomes serious. In Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions, researcher Gary Klein tells the story of a team of firefighters putting out a fire on the first floor of a house. When water was sprayed at the base of the fire, the fire didn’t respond as expected - it didn’t diminish at all. The chief noticed and ordered everyone out - something just didn’t feel right. A few minutes later, the house collapsed - the fire had started in the basement, destroying the foundation. If the team had stayed inside, they would have died. That’s the power and benefit of experience. Adding a Scarcity element to your offer is a great way to encourage people to take action. Scarcity makes people understand that they’ll lose something valuable if they wait, making it more likely they’ll choose to act immediately if they desire what is being offered. The more scarce the value, the more intense the desire. Human attention requires novelty to sustain itself. Continue to offer something new, and people will pay attention to what you have to offer. “To think is easy. To act is difficult. To act as one thinks is the most difficult.” - Goethe P. J. Eby, a former computer programmer who specializes in helping people use their minds more productively, defines Monoidealism this way: the state in which you have exactly one thing on your mind, with no conflicts. It’s a condition that results in one naturally taking action in relation to the thought. It’ll take ten to thirty minutes before your mind becomes absorbed in what you’re doing. Phone calls, coworkers “dropping by to pick your brain,” and other unanticipated demands on your Attention will break your Monoideal state, so priority number one is ensuring that you don’t get distracted. Eliminate inner Conflicts. I wasn’t happy with how my work was turning out, and doing more of what wasn’t working would be a waste. Spending some time revising the structure of the book resolved that Conflict, simultaneously making the book better and eliminating the source of the resistance. Kick-start the Attention process by doing a “dash.” Since it can take ten to thirty minutes to get into the zone, setting aside ten to thirty minutes for a quick burst of focused work can make it much easier to get into the zone quickly. “What are the two or three most important things that I need to do today? What are the things that - if I got them done today - would make a huge difference?” Write only those tasks on your MIT list, then try to get them done first thing in the morning. Setting an artificial deadline is extremely effective. If you set a goal to have all of your MITs done by 10:00 a.m., you’ll be amazed at how quickly you can complete the day’s most important tasks. Setting a vague goal is like walking into a restaurant and saying, “I’m hungry. I want some food.” You’ll stay hungry until you order something. One of the fascinating ramifications of our brain’s Pattern Matching function is that we’re constantly scanning the Environment for useful information. If you tell your mind specifically what you want to find, it will alert you whenever your senses notice it. By taking a few moments to consciously decide what you’re interested in and what you’re looking for, you can program your mind to alert you when it notices something relevant. Taking a few minutes before you start reading to figure out (1) why you want to read this material and (2) what kind of information you’re looking for. Jotting down a few notes before picking up the book reinforces exactly what you’re looking to find. After defining your purpose, you then pick up the book and flip through it quickly, paying particular Attention to the table of contents, section headings, and index - condensed sources of information about what the book contains and how the material is structured. Jotting down terms and concepts that appear to be particularly important helps prime your brain to notice them when they appear later. This process only takes a few minutes, but the impact it has on your reading speed is profound. It’s possible to extract most of the useful content in almost any nonfiction book in less than twenty minutes. The Five-Fold Why is a technique to help you discover what you actually want. Instead of taking your desires at face value, examining the root cause of what you want can help you define your core desires more accurately. Applying the Five-Fold Why is easy: whenever you set a Goal or objective, ask yourself why you want it. If you want to become a millionaire, ask yourself why you want to have a million dollars. The purpose of the Five-Fold How is to create a complete chain of actions from your big idea all the way down to things that you can do right now. “Words are a lens to focus one’s mind.” - Ayn Rand Your mind works is that it handles information from outside your head better than the thoughts that are rattling around inside your head. By converting our internal thought processes into an external form, Externalization essentially gives us the ability to reinput information into our own brains via a different channel, which gives us access to additional cognitive resources we can use to process the same information in a different way. Challenges and issues that seem insurmountable while they’re bouncing around in your frontal lobe can often be solved surprisingly quickly after they’re put on paper. Solving our own problems while talking with a friend or colleague. By the time you’re done talking, you’re likely to have more insight into your problem. Self-Elicitation. Simply by asking yourself questions, you’re exploring options you previously didn’t consider and Priming your brain to notice related information. Counterfactual Simulation allows you to “force” your brain to run the simulations you want it to run. Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA, once said, “If you split your day into ten-minute increments, and you try to waste as few of those ten-minute increments as possible, you’ll be amazed at what you can get done.” Ingvar’s Rule - assume each task will take no more than ten minutes to complete, then begin. Charles Darwin’s famous quip “Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge” Once you learn a bit more about a new subject, you become “consciously incompetent” - you know you don’t know what you’re doing. As a result, most individuals become less confident in their abilities shortly after learning more about a topic. Developing “conscious competence” - the state of knowing what you’re doing - takes experience, knowledge, and practice. When you’re consciously competent, you regain your confidence: you know the limits of your knowledge and can accurately assess your abilities. Paradoxically, one of the best ways to figure out whether or not you’re right is to actively look for information that proves you’re wrong. Seeking disconfirming evidence will either show you the error of your ways or provide additional evidence for why your position is actually correct - as long as you suspend judgment long enough to learn from the experience. Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. It’s remarkably easy to fall into the trap of comparing your output to an idealized version of yourself who can build Rome in a day, then build the Great Wall of China as a fun side project. Discover things worth Testing: ▶ How much sleep do you need to feel rested and alert? ▶ Which foods make you feel energetic after eating? Which foods make you feel ill or lethargic? ▶ When do you do your most productive work? Are there any patterns in your productivity? ▶ When do you get your best ideas? What are you doing when they occur to you? ▶ What is your biggest source of stress or concern? When do you start worrying, and why? Testing is the best way to ensure that your life gets better over time. By constantly trying new things, you’re learning what works for you and what doesn’t. Over time, you’ll discover Patterns - things that make your life better and things that make your life worse. Power represents your ability to get things done through other people - the more power you have, the more things you can do. If you don’t have a plan, your actions will be determined by someone else. By refusing to make the effort to move in the direction you think is best, you’re ceding Power to those who do have plans. The best way to increase your Power is to do things that increase your influence and Reputation. The more people know your capabilities and respect the Reputation you’ve built, the more Power you will have. England could produce cloth with much less effort, and Portugal was much better at producing wine. As a result, instead of wasting time and money struggling to do something they weren’t good at, Portugal and England would both be better off if they specialized, then traded with each other. Comparative Advantage means it’s better to capitalize on your strengths than to shore up your weaknesses. Comparative Advantage also explains why diverse teams consistently outperform homogenous teams. Too much time spent in communication and coordination can kill a team’s effectiveness. “8 Symptoms of Bureaucratic Breakdown” that appear in teams suffering from Communication Overhead: 1. The Invisible Decision - No one knows how or where decisions are made, and there is no transparency in the decision-making process. 2. Unfinished Business - Too many tasks are started but very few are carried through to the end. 3. Coordination Paralysis - Nothing can be done without checking with a host of interconnected units. 4. Nothing New - There are no radical ideas, inventions, or lateral thinking - a general lack of initiative. 5. Pseudo-Problems - Minor issues become magnified out of all proportion. 6. Embattled Center - The center battles for consistency and control against local/regional units. 7. Negative Deadlines - The deadlines for work become more important than the quality of the work being done. 8. Input Domination - Individuals react to inputs - i.e., whatever gets put in their in-tray - as opposed to using their own initiative. If any of these qualities describe your daily work experience, your team is probably suffering from a case of Communication Overhead. The solution to Communication Overhead is simple but not easy: make your team as small as possible. Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do. - DALE CARNEGIE, Courtesy defined as “accepting small inconveniences on behalf of another person,” Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking. Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity. universally, people hate to be told exactly what to do. “Micromanagement” is the bane of any worker’s existence - if you’re a competent professional, nothing is more demeaning than someone else defining and scrutinizing your work to the last detail. Micromanagement isn’t simply annoying - it’s extremely inefficient. Not only does spelling out every single detail make people feel less Important, it actually impairs their effectiveness. No set of instructions, no matter how detailed, is capable of covering every contingency. When something inevitably changes, micromanagement fails. The best way to eliminate Bystander Apathy in project management is to ensure that all tasks have single, clear owners and deadlines. “Planning is guessing.” The reason we’re so bad at planning is because we’re not omniscient - unforeseen events or circumstances can dramatically impact even the most detailed plans. The best testimonials don’t necessarily contain superlatives: amazing, best, life-changing, and revolutionary have been so overused that people expect them and discount their expectations accordingly. The most effective testimonials tend to follow this format: “I was interested in this offer, but skeptical. I decided to purchase anyway, and I’m very pleased with the end result.” The reason this format is more effective than a litany of people gushing about your offer is that it more closely matches how your prospects are feeling: interested but uncertain. We find comfort among those who agree with us, and growth among those who don’t. Modal Bias is the automatic assumption that our idea or approach is best. Most of us like to assume we have everything together - that we know what we’re talking about, we know what we’re doing, and that our way of doing things is best. Very often, we are quite mistaken. There is always more than one way to get something done. Part of the value of understanding cognitive biases is the knowledge that you’re not immune to them, and simply knowing they exist doesn’t make them any less influential. Individuals tend to rise to the level of other people’s expectations of them. If you don’t expect much from the people you work with, it’s likely you won’t inspire them to perform to the limits of their capabilities. Let them know you expect great things from them, and more often than not, you’ll find that they perform well. Pygmalion Effect is a tendency named after the protagonist of a Greek myth. Pygmalion was a gifted sculptor who created a statue of a woman so perfect that he fell in love with his creation. After Pygmalion desperately prayed to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, she took pity on him by bringing the statue to life. The Pygmalion Effect explains why all of our relationships are, in a very real sense, self-fulfilling prophecies. When others screw up, we blame their character; when we screw up, we attribute the situation to circumstances. SIX SIMPLE PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE REAL-WORLD MANAGEMENT: 1. Recruit the smallest group of people who can accomplish what must be done quickly and with high quality. Comparative Advantage means that some people will be better than others at accomplishing certain tasks, so it pays to invest time and resources in recruiting the best team for the job. Don’t make that team too large, however - Communication Overhead makes each additional team member beyond a core of three to eight people a drag on performance. Small, elite teams are best. 2. Clearly communicate the desired End Result, who is responsible for what, and the current status. Everyone on the team must know the Commander’s Intent of the project, the Reason Why it’s important, and must clearly know the specific parts of the project they’re individually responsible for completing - otherwise, you’re risking Bystander Apathy. 3. Treat people with respect. Consistently using the Golden Trifecta - appreciation, courtesy, and respect - is the best way to make the individuals on your team feel Important and is also the best way to ensure that they respect you as a leader and manager. The more your team works together under mutually supportive conditions, the more Clanning will naturally occur, and the more cohesive the team will become. 4. Create an Environment where everyone can be as productive as possible, then let people do their work. The best working Environment takes full advantage of Guiding Structure - provide the best equipment and tools possible and ensure that the Environment reinforces the work the team is doing. To avoid having energy sapped by the Cognitive Switching Penalty, shield your team from as many distractions as possible, which includes nonessential bureaucracy and meetings. 5. Refrain from having unrealistic expectations regarding certainty and prediction. Create an aggressive plan to complete the project, but be aware in advance that Uncertainty and the Planning Fallacy mean your initial plan will almost certainly be incomplete or inaccurate in a few important respects. Update your plan as you go along, using what you learn along the way, and continually reapply Parkinson’s Law to find the shortest feasible path to completion that works, given the necessary Trade-offs required by the work. 6. Measure to see if what you’re doing is working - if not, try another approach. One of the primary fallacies of effective Management is that it makes learning unnecessary. This mind-set assumes your initial plan should be 100 percent perfect and followed to the letter. The exact opposite is true: effective Management means planning for learning, which requires constant adjustments along the way. Constantly Measure your performance across a small set of Key Performance Indicators - if what you’re doing doesn’t appear to be working, Experiment with another approach. “A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: a complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a simple system.” - John Gall, systems theorist A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it. Inflows are resources moving into a system. Water into a sink. Money into a bank account. Raw materials into an assembly line. New hires into a company. Outflows are resources flowing out of a system. Water draining from a sink. Money flowing out of a bank account. Finished goods exiting an assembly line. Employees leaving the company due to retirement, termination, or changing jobs. Follow the Flows, and you’re on your way to understanding how the system works. The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement, Eliyahu Goldratt Goldratt proposes the “Five Focusing Steps,” a method you can use to IMPROVE THE THROUGHPUT OF ANY SYSTEM: 1. Identification: examining the system to find the limiting factor. 2. Exploitation: ensuring that the resources related to the Constraint aren’t wasted. 3. Subordination: redesigning the entire system to support the Constraint. 4. Elevation: permanently increasing the capacity of the Constraint. 5. Reevaluation: after making a change, reevaluating the system to see where the Constraint is located. “The system that will evolve most rapidly must fall between, and more precisely on, the edge of chaos - possessing order, but with the parts connected loosely enough to be easily altered.” - E. O. Wilson, systems theorist Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away. A Selection Test is an Environmental constraint that determines which Systems continue to self-perpetuate and which ones “die.” Businesses also have Selection Tests: enough value provided to customers, enough revenue to cover expenses, enough Profit to stay financially Sufficient. Many people think of Selection Tests as “survival of the fittest,” but “death of the unfit” is a more accurate description. If a self-perpetuating system fails to satisfy a Selection Test, it will cease to exist. If you can’t get enough air, you’ll die. If your business can’t bring in enough revenue to maintain Sufficiency, it’ll die. Changing Environments and Selection Tests are an entrepreneur’s best friend - they’re what allow small companies to outperform large, entrenched competitors. If you can identify what the Selection Tests in a market really are, you’ll be able to compete in that market much more effectively. Selection Tests are ruthless: satisfy them, and you’ll thrive. Fail to adapt to changing conditions, and you’ll die. Many people make a business of selling certainty, which doesn’t exist. Prediction, forecasting, and other forms of business soothsaying are popular because they provide the illusion that the future is knowable and controllable. Exercises in prediction aren’t worth the cost - if there were a foolproof way to predict gas prices, interest rates, or stock prices, the people with that magic knowledge would be enormously wealthy and would have no need to sell anything to you. “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.” - Charles Darwin Because of our natural Pattern Matching abilities, we tend to see patterns where none exist and tend to attribute random Changes to skill if the Changes are good or misfortune if they’re bad. Deconstruction is the process of separating complex systems into the smallest possible subsystems in order to understand how things work. Instead of trying to understand the system all at once, you break up the system into parts, then work on understanding the subsystems and how they interact with one another. Deconstruction is the reverse-engineering aspect of Gall’s Law. Remember : complex systems that work inevitably evolved from simpler systems that also worked. To improve the system you’re examining, you don’t have to pay Attention to everything - just a few key Measurements that actually matter. “Profit is sanity. Turnover is vanity.” Here are a few questions I use to identify a business’s KPIs: Value Creation: How quickly is the system creating value? What is the current level of Inflows? Marketing: How many people are paying Attention to your offer? How many prospects are giving you Permission to provide more information? Sales: How many prospects are becoming paying customers? What is the average customer’s Lifetime Value? Value Delivery: How quickly can you serve each customer? What is your current returns or complaints rate? Finance: What is your Profit Margin ? How much Purchasing Power do you have? Are you financially Sufficient? If you need to calculate Confidence Intervals, I recommend picking up Principles of Statistics by M. G. Bulmer for an in-depth primer. He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense. SOME USEFUL RATIOS TO TRACK: - Return on Assets: For every $1 you invest in equipment, how much revenue do you collect? - Return on Capital: For every $1 you borrow or take on in investment, how much revenue do you collect? - Return on Promotion: For every $1 you spend in advertising, how much revenue do you collect? - Profit per Employee: For every person you employ, how much profit does your business generate? - Closing Ratio: For every prospect you serve, how many purchase? - Returns/Complaints Ratio: For every sale you make, how many choose to return or complain? “How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg.” - Abraham Lincoln In theory there’s no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is. Trying to Optimize for many variables at once doesn’t work - you need to be able to concentrate on a single variable for a while. Optimize and Refactor up to the point you start experiencing Diminishing Returns, then focus on doing something else. Automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. Automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency. The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with, but whether it’s the same problem you had last year. Well-defined Standard Operating Procedures are useful because they reduce Friction and minimize Willpower Depletion. Checklisting will help you define a System for a process that hasn’t yet been formalized - once the Checklist has been created, it’s easier to see how to improve or Automate the system. Create explicit Checklists for the Five Parts of Your Business, then make sure they’re followed every single time. In The One-Straw Revolution, Masanobu Fukuoka wrote about his experiments with natural farming, which mostly involved letting nature take its course and intervening as little as possible. While most farms were introducing chemicals and machinery into agriculture, Fukuoka was consciously doing nothing - and reaping the rewards of high yields and ever-increasing soil richness. Instead of trying to do too much, Fukuoka only did what was absolutely necessary. As a result, his fields were consistently among the most productive in the area. Cessation takes guts. It’s often unpopular or unpalatable to do nothing, even if doing nothing is actually the right solution. Instead of trying to predict the future with 100 percent accuracy, Scenario Planning can help you prepare for many different possible futures. Future-construct the most likely scenarios and plan what you’ll do if they occur, and you’ll be prepared for whatever actually happens. Constant Experimentation is the only way you can identify what will actually produce the result you desire. Often, the best (or only) way to learn things is to jump in and try. At the beginning, you may be in over your head, but there’s no faster way to learn what works. Once you’re committed to exploring something, you’ll learn far more quickly than if you’d cowered on the sidelines. You learn the most from what doesn’t go well. As long as your mistakes don’t kill you, paying Attention to what doesn’t work can give you useful information you can use to discover what does. All failures are temporary - what you learn in the process always helps you move forward. Experimentation is the essence of living a satisfying, productive, fulfilling life. The more you Experiment, the more you learn, and the more you’ll achieve.

Switch,Chip Heath and Dan Heath,0385528752,9,"People with the large buckets ate 53 percent more popcorn than people with the medium size. Bigger container = more eating. Imagine that someone showed you the data from the popcorn-eating study but didn’t mention the bucket sizes. A public-health expert, studying that data alongside you, would likely get very worried about the Gluttons. We need to motivate these people to adopt healthier snacking behaviors! Let’s find ways to show them the health hazards of eating so much! But wait a second. If you want people to eat less popcorn, the solution is pretty simple: Give them smaller buckets. You don’t have to worry about their knowledge or their attitudes. You can see how easy it would be to turn an easy change problem (shrinking people’s buckets) into a hard change problem (convincing people to think differently). And that’s the first surprise about change: What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. Clocky is not a product for a sane species. If Spock wants to get up at 5:45 a.m., he’ll just get up. No drama required. Our built-in schizophrenia is a deeply weird thing, but we don’t think much about it because we’re so used to it. Elephant and Rider metaphor (from Happiness Hypothesis): If you’re contemplating a change, the Elephant is the one who gets things done. To make progress toward a goal, whether it’s noble or crass, requires the energy and drive of the Elephant. And this strength is the mirror image of the Rider’s great weakness: spinning his wheels. The Rider tends to overanalyze and overthink things. The Rider provides the planning and direction, and the Elephant provides the energy. When the Elephant really wants something, the Rider can be trusted to find rationalizations for it. The Rider has his own issues. He’s a navel-gazer, an analyzer, a wheel-spinner. If the Rider isn’t sure exactly what direction to go, he tends to lead the Elephant in circles. To change behavior, you’ve got to direct the Rider, motivate the Elephant, and shape the Path. If you can do all three at once, dramatic change can happen Self-control is an exhaustible resource. We burn up self-control in a wide variety of situations: managing the impression we’re making on others; coping with fears; controlling our spending. When people try to change things, they’re usually tinkering with behaviors that have become automatic, and changing those behaviors requires careful supervision by the Rider. The bigger the change you’re suggesting, the more it will sap people’s self-control. And when people exhaust their self-control, what they’re exhausting are the mental muscles needed to think creatively, to focus, to inhibit their impulses, and to persist in the face of frustration or failure. In other words, they’re exhausting precisely the mental muscles needed to make a big change. Jerry Sternin who found how to turn around malnutrition in Vietnam: Most people in Sternin’s situation would have been itching to make an announcement, to call the village together and unveil a set of recommendations. Gather ’round, everyone: I’ve studied your problem and now I have the answer! Here are Sternin’s 5 Rules for Fighting Malnutrition. But Sternin refused to make a formal announcement. Knowledge does not change behavior. We have all encountered crazy shrinks and obese doctors and divorced marriage counselors. Bright spots solve the “Not Invented Here” problem. Some people have a knee-jerk skeptical response to “imported” solutions. Imagine the public outcry if an American politician proposed that the United States adopt the French health care system. (Or vice versa.) We all think our group is the smartest. By looking for bright spots within the very village he was trying to change, Sternin ensured that the solution would be a native one. They weren’t experts. They didn’t walk in with the answers. All they had was a deep faith in the power of bright spots. Suppose that you go to bed tonight and sleep well. Sometime, in the middle of the night, while you are sleeping, a miracle happens and all the troubles that brought you here are resolved. When you wake up in the morning, what’s the first small sign you’d see that would make you think, ‘Well, something must have happened - the problem is gone!’?” The Miracle Question doesn’t ask you to describe the miracle itself; it asks you to identify the tangible signs that the miracle happened. A second question, which is perhaps even more important. The Exception Question: “When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle, even just for a short time?” Demonstrate, in a subtle way, is that the client is capable of solving her own problem. As a matter of fact, the client is offering up proof that she’s already solved it. Let’s replay that scene, where things were working for you. What was happening? How did you behave? You are simply asking yourself, “What’s working and how can we do more of it?” Big problem, small solution. This is a theme you will see again and again. Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions. Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of small solutions, sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades. “What’s working, and how can we do more of it?” Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked. Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: “What’s broken, and how do we fix it?” “Bad is stronger than good.” Exhibit A: People who were shown photos of bad and good events spent longer viewing the bad ones. Exhibit B: When people learn bad stuff about someone else, it’s stickier than good stuff. People pay closer attention to the bad stuff, reflect on it more, remember it longer, and weigh it more heavily in assessing the person overall. When your kids are making A’s and B’s, you don’t think much about their grades. But when they make a D or an F, you spring into action. It’s weird when you think about, isn’t it? Decisions are the Rider’s turf, and because they require careful supervision and self-control, they tax the Rider’s strength. (Remember the radish/chocolate-chip cookie study from Chapter 1.) The more choices the Rider is offered, the more exhausted the Rider gets. To spark movement in a new direction, you need to provide crystal-clear guidance. That’s why scripting is important - you’ve got to think about the specific behavior that you’d want to see in a tough moment. Both succeeded by formulating solutions that were strikingly smaller than the problems they were intended to solve. The challenges facing Miner County were big and sprawling: the decline of an industrial base, the aging of a population. The citizens understood these challenges well, but the knowledge was TBU - true but useless. It was paralyzing knowledge. We want a goal that can be tackled in months or years, not decades. We want what we might call a destination postcard - a vivid picture from the near-term future that shows what could be possible. You have to back up your destination postcard with a good behavioral script. That’s a recipe for success. In almost all successful change efforts, the sequence of change is not ANALYZE-THINK-CHANGE, but rather SEE-FEEL-CHANGE. Positive illusion: Our brains are positive illusion factories: Only 2 percent of high school seniors believe their leadership skills are below average. A full 25 percent of people believe they’re in the top 1 percent in their ability to get along with others. Positive emotions are designed to “broaden and build” our repertoire of thoughts and actions. Joy, for example, makes us want to play. Play doesn’t have a script, it broadens the kinds of things we consider doing. We become willing to fool around, to explore or invent new activities. And because joy encourages us to play, we are building resources and skills. The positive emotion of interest broadens what we want to investigate. When we’re interested, we want to get involved, to learn new things, to tackle new experiences. We become more open to new ideas. The positive emotion of pride, experienced when we achieve a personal goal, broadens the kinds of tasks we contemplate for the future, encouraging us to pursue even bigger goals. Robyn Waters of Target, a master of positive emotions. She didn’t try to create a burning platform: “Wal-Mart is eating our lunch! Target is on its deathbed! Come with me into the fiery seas!” Instead, she found a way to engage the fresh thinking and enthusiasm of her colleagues. People find it more motivating to be partly finished with a longer journey than to be at the starting gate of a shorter one. One way to motivate action, then, is to make people feel as though they’re already closer to the finish line than they might have thought. That sense of progress is critical, because the Elephant in us is easily demoralized. If you’re leading a change effort, you better start looking for those first two stamps to put on your team’s cards. Rather than focusing solely on what’s new and different about the change to come, make an effort to remind people what’s already been conquered. A business cliché commands us to “raise the bar.” But that’s exactly the wrong instinct if you want to motivate a reluctant Elephant. You need to lower the bar. What good is a 5-minute session of cleaning? Not much. It gets you moving, though, and that’s the hardest part. Starting an unpleasant task is always worse than continuing it. So once you start cleaning house, chances are you won’t stop at 5 minutes. Because identities are central to the way people make decisions, any change effort that violates someone’s identity is likely doomed to failure. (That’s why it’s so clumsy when people instinctively reach for “incentives” to change other people’s behavior.) So the question is this: How can you make your change a matter of identity rather than a matter of consequences? Identity is going to play a role in nearly every change situation. Even yours. When you think about the people whose behavior needs to change, ask yourself whether they would agree with this statement: “I aspire to be the kind of person who would make this change.” If their answer is yes, that’s an enormous factor in your favor. If their answer is no, then you’ll have to work hard to show them that they should aspire to a different self-image. Three identity questions: - Who am I? - What kind of situation is this? - What would someone like me do in this situation? The Elephant really, really hates to fail. This presents a difficulty for you when you are trying to change or when you’re trying to lead change. You know that you or your audience will fail, and you know that the failure will trigger the “flight” instinct. How do you keep the Elephant motivated when it faces a long, treacherous road? The answer may sound strange: You need to create the expectation of failure - not the failure of the mission itself, but failure en route. This notion takes us into a fascinating area of research that is likely to change the way you view the world. People who have a growth mindset believe that abilities are like muscles - they can be built up with practice. With concerted effort, you can make yourself better at writing or managing or listening to your spouse. With a growth mindset, you tend to accept more challenges despite the risk of failure. You’re more inclined to accept criticism, because ultimately it makes you better. You may not be as good as others right now, but you’re thinking long-term, in a tortoise-versus-hare kind of way. A growth mindset compliment praises effort rather than natural skill: “I’m proud of how hard you worked on that project!” “I could tell you listened to your coach’s comments - you really had your elbow under those jump shots today.” Students were reminded that “Everything is hard before it is easy,” and that they should never give up because they didn’t master something immediately. To create and sustain change, you’ve got to act more like a coach and less like a scorekeeper. You’ve got to embrace a growth mindset and instill it in your team. IDEO: When a team embarks on a new project, team members are filled with hope and optimism. As they start to collect data and observe real people struggling with existing products, they find that new ideas spring forth effortlessly. Then comes the difficult task of integrating all those fresh ideas into a coherent new design. At this “insight” stage, it’s easy to get depressed, because insight doesn’t always strike immediately. The project often feels like a failure in the middle. But if the team persists through this valley of angst and doubt, it eventually emerges with a growing sense of momentum. Team members begin to test out their new designs, and they realize the improvements they’ve made, and they keep tweaking the design to make it better. And they come to realize, we’ve cracked this problem. That’s when the team reaches the peak of confidence. Notice what team leaders at IDEO are doing with the peaks-and-valley visual: They are creating the expectation of failure. They are telling team members not to trust that initial flush of good feeling at the beginning of the project, because what comes next is hardship and toil and frustration. Yet, strangely enough, when they deliver this warning, it comes across as optimistic. That’s the paradox of the growth mindset. Although it seems to draw attention to failure, and in fact encourages us to seek out failure, it is unflaggingly optimistic. We will struggle, we will fail, we will be knocked down - but throughout, we’ll get better, and we’ll succeed in the end. The growth mindset, then, is a buffer against defeatism. It reframes failure as a natural part of the change process. And that’s critical, because people will persevere only if they perceive falling down as learning rather than as failing. The teams who failed made the mistake of trying to “get it right on the first try” and were motivated by the chance to “perform, to shine, or to execute perfectly.” But of course no one “shines” on the first few tries - this mindset set the teams up for failure. By contrast, the successful teams focused on learning. They didn’t assume that mastery would come quickly, and they anticipated that they’d face challenges. In the end, they were the ones who were more likely to get it right. Students often didn’t do their homework, or they turned in shoddy work. Getting a D or an F was an easy way out in a way. They might get a poor grade, but at least they would be done. In the new system, the students couldn’t stop until they’d cleared the bar. “We define up front to the kids what’s an A, B, and C,” said Howard. “If they do substandard work, the teacher will say, ‘Not Yet.’” People have a systematic tendency to ignore the situational forces that shape other people’s behavior. He called this deep-rooted tendency the “Fundamental Attribution Error.” The error lies in our inclination to attribute people’s behavior to the way they are rather than to the situation they are in. Some students received a basic letter announcing the launch of a food drive the following week and asking them to bring canned food to a booth on Tressider Plaza (a well-known spot on campus). Other students received a more detailed letter, which included a map to the precise spot, a request for a can of beans, and a suggestion that they think about a time when they’d ordinarily be near Tressider Plaza so they wouldn’t have to go out of their way to get there. Students who received the more detailed letter were substantially more charitable: 42 percent Notice how many times people have tweaked the environment to shape your behavior. Example: Robby and Kent who frequently arrive late and then sit in the back of the room: Shape the Path. 1. Tweak the environment. Lock the door when the bell rings so latecomers are stuck in the hallway. 2. Build habits. Start having a daily quiz with one or two quick questions at the beginning of every class. If Robby and Kent aren’t present to take the quiz, they’ll fail. 3. Rally the herd. Post a class “on-time” record on the wall. Maybe when Robby and Kent see that they’re the only students violating the social norm to be on time, they’ll change their ways. 4. Build habits. Set a policy that the last student in his or her seat every day will be asked to answer the first question. 5. Rally the herd. Find a way to let Robby and Kent know that the other students dislike what they’re doing (as they almost certainly do). Often troublemakers have the illusion that their defiant behavior makes them folk heroes. They can be deflated quickly by frank peer feedback. 6. Tweak the environment. Do what Bart Millar actually did: He bought a used couch and put it right at the front of the classroom. It was immediately obvious that this couch was the cool place to sit - students could slouch and relax instead of sitting at a dorky desk. Suddenly Robby and Kent started getting to class early every day so they could “get a good seat.” They were volunteering to sit at the front of the classroom. Genius. Leaders had to reshape the Path consciously. With some simple tweaks to the environment, suddenly the right behaviors emerged. It wasn’t the people who changed; it was the situation. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. Design an environment in which undesired behaviors are made not only harder but impossible. In trying to minimize the risk of bad outcomes, injury-prevention experts often turn to the Haddon Matrix, a simple framework that provides a way to think systematically about accidents by highlighting three key periods of time: pre-event, event, and post-event. Why are habits so important? They are, in essence, behavioral autopilot. They allow lots of good behaviors to happen without the Rider taking charge. Remember that the Rider’s self-control is exhaustible, so it’s a huge plus if some positive things can happen “free” on autopilot. To change yourself or other people, you’ve got to change habits. Rackspace example: When the call-queuing system was thrown out, the customer-service staffers quickly developed the habit of answering the phone. Action triggers can have a profound power to motivate people to do the things they know they need to do. Peter Gollwitzer argues that the value of action triggers resides in the fact that we are preloading a decision. Dropping off Anna at school triggers the next action, going to the gym. There’s no cycle of conscious deliberation. By preloading the decision, we conserve the Rider’s self-control. When people predecide, they “pass the control of their behavior on to the environment.” Gollwitzer says that action triggers “protect goals from tempting distractions, bad habits, or competing goals.” Habits are behavioral autopilot, and that’s why they’re such a critical tool for leaders. Leaders who can instill habits that reinforce their teams’ goals are essentially making progress for free. They’ve changed behavior in a way that doesn’t draw down the Rider’s reserves of self-control. Habits will form inevitably, whether they’re formed intentionally or not. You’ve probably created lots of team habits unwittingly. If your staff meetings always start out with genial small talk, then you’ve created a habit. You’ve designed your meeting autopilot to yield a few minutes of warm-up small talk. The hard question for a leader is not how to form habits but which habits to encourage. A good change leader never thinks, “Why are these people acting so badly? They must be bad people.” A change leader thinks, “How can I set up a situation that brings out the good in these people?” Checklists educate people about what’s best, showing them the ironclad right way to do something. (That means that checklists are effective at directing the Rider.) People fear checklists because they see them as dehumanizing - maybe because they associate them with the exhaustive checklists that allow inexperienced teenagers to operate fast-food chains successfully. They think if something is simple enough to be put in a checklist, a monkey can do it. Well, if that’s true, grab a pilot’s checklist and try your luck with a 747. Checklists simply make big screwups less likely. Shamu didn’t learn to jump through a hoop because her trainer was bitching at her. She learned because she had a trainer who was patient and focused and reinforced every step of the journey. Cognitive dissonance works in your favor. People don’t like to act in one way and think in another. So once a small step has been taken, and people have begun to act in a new way, it will be increasingly difficult for them to dislike the way they’re acting. Similarly, as people begin to act differently, they’ll start to think of themselves differently, and as their identity evolves, it will reinforce the new way of doing things.

The Happiness Hypothesis,Jonathan Haidt,0465028020,9,"We might already have encountered the Greatest Idea, the insight that would have transformed us had we savored it, taken it to heart, and worked it into our lives. The foundational idea of this book: The mind is divided into parts that sometimes conflict. Like a rider on the back of an elephant, the conscious, reasoning part of the mind has only limited control of what the elephant does. I'm a rider on the back of an elephant. I'm holding the reins in my hands, and by pulling one way or the other I can tell the elephant to turn, to stop, or to go. I can direct things, but only when the elephant doesn't have desires of his own. When the elephant really wants to do something, I'm no match for him. Buddha said, ""Our life is the creation of our mind."" The Golden Rule: Reciprocity is the most important tool for getting along with people. Human thinking depends on metaphor. We understand new or complex things in relation to things we already know. Desire and reason are pulling in different directions. I see the right way and approve it, but follow the wrong. Confabulation: when we fabricate reasons to explain our own behavior. The rider is good at inventing convincing explanations for your behavior, even when it has no knowledge of the causes of your behavior. When the rest of us look out at the world, our emotional brains have instantly and automatically appraised the possibilities. One possibility usually jumps out at us as the obvious best one. We need only use reason to weigh the pros and cons when two or three possibilities seem equally good. Human rationality depends critically on sophisticated emotionality. It is only because our emotional brains works so well that our reasoning can work at all. Exposure to words related to the elderly makes people walk more slowly; words related to professors make people smarter at the game of Trivial Pursuit; and words related to soccer hooligans make people dumber. Automatic processes have been through thousands of product cycles and are nearly perfect. This difference in maturity between automatic and controlled processes helps explain why we have inexpensive computers that can solve logic, math, and chess problems better than any human beings can (most of us struggle with these tasks), but none of our robots, no matter how costly, can walk through the woods as well as the average six - year - old child (our perceptual and motor systems are superb). (Marshmallow Experiment:) The successful children were those who looked away from the temptation or were able to think about other enjoyable activities. These thinking skills are an aspect of emotional intelligence - an ability to understand and regulate one's own feelings and desires. An emotionally intelligent person has a skilled rider who knows how to distract and coax the elephant without having to engage in a direct contest of wills. It's hard for the controlled system to beat the automatic system by willpower alone. Once you understand the power of stimulus control, you can use it to your advantage by changing the stimuli in your environment and avoiding undesirable ones. By choosing to stare at something that revolts the automatic system, the rider can begin to change what the elephant will want in the future. Whenever I am on a cliff, a rooftop, or a high balcony, the imp of the perverse whispers in my ear, ""Jump."" It's not a command, it's just a word that pops into my consciousness. When I'm at a dinner party sitting next to someone I respect, the imp works hard to suggest the most inappropriate things I could possibly say. Who or what is the imp? Dan Wegner, one of the most perverse and creative social psychologists, has dragged the imp into the lab and made it confess to being an aspect of automatic processing. Moral judgment is like aesthetic judgment. When you see a painting, you usually know instantly and automatically whether you like it. If someone asks you to explain your judgment, you confabulate. Moral arguments are much the same: Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first, and their reasons are invented on the fly, to throw at each other. When you refute a person's argument, does she generally change her mind and agree with you? Of course not, because the argument you defeated was not the cause of her position; it was made up after the judgment was already made. In moral arguments, the rider goes beyond being just an advisor to the elephant; he becomes a lawyer, fighting in the court of public opinion to persuade others of the elephant's point of view. What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow. Our life is the creation of our mind. To take something ""philosophically"" means to accept a great misfortune without weeping or even suffering. We use this term in part because of the calmness, self-control, and courage that three ancient philosophers - Socrates, Seneca, and Boethius - showed while they awaited their executions. Adverse fortune is more beneficial than good fortune; the latter only makes men greedy for more, but adversity makes them strong. ""No man can ever be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune."" Nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it. Epiphanies can be life-altering, but most fade in days or weeks. The rider can't just decide to change and then order the elephant to go along with the program. Lasting change can come only by retraining the elephant, and that's hard to do. Whenever you see or hear a word that resembles your name, a little flash of pleasure biases you toward thinking the thing is good. People named Dennis or Denise are slightly more likely than people with other names to become dentists. Men named Lawrence and women named Laurie are more likely to become lawyers. Louis and Louise are more likely to move to Louisiana or St. Louis, and George and Georgina are more likely to move to Georgia. The own-name preference even shows up in marriage records: People are slightly more likely to marry people whose names sound like their own, even if the similarity is just sharing a first initial. Bad is stronger than good. Responses to threats and unpleasantness are faster, stronger, and harder to inhibit than responses to opportunities and pleasures. This principle, called negativity bias, shows up all over psychology. The elephant reacts before the rider even sees the snake on the path. Although you can tell yourself that you are not afraid of snakes, if your elephant fears them and rears up, you'll still be thrown. Thoughts can cause emotions (as when you reflect on a foolish thing you said), but emotions can also cause thoughts, primarily by raising mental filters that bias subsequent information processing. A flash of fear makes you extra vigilant for additional threats; you look at the world through a filter that interprets ambiguous events as possible dangers. A flash of anger toward someone raises a filter through which you see everything the offending person says or does as a further insult or transgression. Feelings of sadness blind you to all pleasures and opportunities. Genes make at least some contribution to nearly every trait. Whether the trait is intelligence, extroversion, fearfulness, religiosity, political leaning, liking for jazz, or dislike of spicy foods, identical twins are more similar than fraternal twins, and they are usually almost as similar if they were separated at birth. Genes are not blueprints specifying the structure of a person; they are better thought of as recipes for producing a person over many years. Cortical ""lefties"" are less subject to depression and recover more quickly from negative experiences. The difference between cortical righties and lefties can be seen even in infants: Ten-month-old babies showing more activity on the right side are more likely to cry when separated briefly from their mothers. And this difference in infancy appears to reflect an aspect of personality that is stable, for most people, all the way through adulthood. Babies who show a lot more activity on the right side of the forehead become toddlers who are more anxious about novel situations; as teenagers, they are more likely to be fearful about dating and social activities; and, finally, as adults, they are more likely to need psychotherapy to loosen up. Having lost out in the cortical lottery, they will struggle all their lives to weaken the grip of an overactive withdrawal system. John Milton's paraphrase of Aurelius: ""The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven."" You can change your affective style too - but again, you can't do it by sheer force of will. You have to do something that will change your repertoire of available thoughts. Here are three of the best methods for doing so: meditation, cognitive therapy, and Prozac. All three are effective because they work on the elephant. There are many kinds of meditation, but they all have in common a conscious attempt to focus attention in a nonanalytical way. He mapped out the distorted thought processes characteristic of depressed people and trained his patients to catch and challenge these thoughts. Depressed people are caught in a feedback loop in which distorted thoughts cause negative feelings, which then distort thinking further. Beck's discovery is that you can break the cycle by changing the thoughts. A big part of cognitive therapy is training clients to catch their thoughts, write them down, name the distortions, and then find alternative and more accurate ways of thinking. ""cognitive behavioral therapy"" Proust wrote that the only true voyage is ""not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes."" Horror fascinates me, particularly when there is no victim. I study moral reactions to harmless taboo violations such as consensual incest and private flag desecration. These things just feel wrong to most people, even when they can't explain why. Prozac: It's easy for those who did well in the cortical lottery to preach about the importance of hard work and the unnaturalness of chemical shortcuts. But for those who, through no fault of their own, ended up on the negative half of the affective style spectrum, Prozac is a way to compensate for the unfairness of the cortical lottery. Tit-for-tat strategy is to be nice on the first round of interaction, but after that, do to your partner whatever your partner did to you on the previous round. Gratitude and vengefulness are big steps on the road that led to human ultrasociality, and it's important to realize that they are two sides of one coin. It would be hard to evolve one without the other. An individual who had gratitude without vengefulness would be an easy mark for exploitation, and a vengeful and ungrateful individual would quickly alienate all potential cooperative partners. Human beings ought to live in groups of around 150 people, judging from the logarithm of our brain size; and sure enough, studies of hunter-gatherer groups, military units, and city dwellers' address hooks suggest that 100 to 150 is the ""natural"" group size within which people can know just about everyone directly, by name and face, and know how each person is related to everybody else. When you pass on a piece of juicy gossip, what happens? Your friend's reciprocity reflex kicks in and she feels a slight pressure to return the favor. If she knows something about the person or event in question, she is likely to speak up: ""Oh really? Well, I heard that he ..."" Gossip is overwhelmingly critical, and it is primarily about the moral and social violations of others. When people pass along high-quality (juicy) gossip, they feel more powerful, they have a better shared sense of what is right and what's wrong, and they feel more closely connected to their gossip partners. Gossip is a policeman and a teacher. Without it, there would be chaos and ignorance. Gossip paired with reciprocity allow karma to work here on earth, not in the next life. Scandal is great entertainment because it allows people to feel contempt, a moral emotion that gives feelings of moral superiority while asking nothing in return. With contempt you don't need to right the wrong (as with anger) or flee the scene (as with fear or disgust). And best of all, contempt is made to share. Stories about the moral failings of others are among the most common kinds of gossip. The great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities, and are often more influenced by the things that seem than by those that are. ""So convenient a thing is it to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for every thing one has a mind to do."" - Benjamin Franklin People who hold pervasive positive illusions about themselves, their abilities, and their future prospects are mentally healthier, happier, and better liked than people who lack such illusions. People really are open to information that will predict the behavior of others, but they refuse to adjust their self-assessments. ""naive realism"": Each of us thinks we see the world directly, as it really is. We believe that the facts as we see them are there for all to see, therefore others should agree with us. If they don't agree, it follows either that they have not yet been exposed to the relevant facts or else that they are blinded by their interests and ideologies. People acknowledge that their own backgrounds have shaped their views, but such experiences are invariably seen as deepening one's insights; for example, being a doctor gives a person special insight into the problems of the health - care industry. But the background of other people is used to explain their biases and covert motivations; for example, doctors think that lawyers disagree with them about tort reform not because they work with the victims of malpractice (and therefore have their own special insights) but because their self-interest biases their thinking. It just seems plain as day, to the naive realist, that everyone is influenced by ideology and self-interest. Except for me. I see things as they are. If I could nominate one candidate for ""biggest obstacle to world peace and social harmony,"" it would be naive realism because it is so easily ratcheted up from the individual to the group level: My group is right because we see things as they are. Those who disagree are obviously biased by their religion, their ideology, or their self-interest. Naive realism gives us a world full of good and evil, and this brings us to the most disturbing implication of the sages' advice about hypocrisy: Good and evil do not exist outside of our beliefs about them. People want to believe they are on a mission from God, or that they are fighting for some more secular good (animals, fetuses, women's rights), and you can't have much of a mission without good allies and a good enemy. If God is all good and all powerful, either he allows evil to flourish (which means he is not all good), or else he struggles against evil (which means he is not all powerful). A three-thousand-year-old question had been given a complete and compelling psychological explanation the previous year by Roy Baumeister, one of today's most creative social psychologists. In ""Evil: Inside Human Cruelty and Agression"". The myth of pure evil is the ultimate self-serving bias. When someone's high esteem is unrealistic or narcissistic, it is easily threatened by reality. In reaction to those threats, people often lash out violently. Baumeister questions the usefulness of programs that try raise children's self-esteem directly instead of by teaching them skills they can be proud of. Such direct enhancement can potentially foster unstable narcissism. To really get a mass atrocity going you need idealism - the belief that your violence is a means to a moral end. The major atrocities of the 20th century were carried out largely either by men who thought they were creating a utopia or else by men who believed they were defending their homeland or tribe from attack. Idealism easily becomes dangerous because it brings with it, almost inevitably, the belief that the ends justify the means. If you are fighting for good or for God, what matters is the outcome, not the path. The world we live in is not really one made of rocks, trees, and physical objects; it is a world of insults, opportunities, status symbols, betrayals, saints, and sinners. All this moralism, righteousness, and hypocrisy. It's beyond silly - it is tragic, for it suggests that human beings will never achieve a state of lasting peace and harmony. So what can you do about it? The first step is to see it as a game and stop taking it so seriously. Write down your thoughts, learn to recognize the distortions in your thoughts, and then think of a more appropriate thought. You will see the fault in yourself only if you set out on a deliberate and effortful quest to look for it. Try this now: Think of a recent interpersonal conflict with someone you care about and then find one way in which your behavior was not exemplary. Finding fault with yourself is also the key to overcoming the hypocrisy and judgmentalism that damages so many valuable relationships. ""Do not seek to have events happen as you want them to, but instead want them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go well."" When it comes to goal pursuit, it really is the journey that counts, not the destination. Set for yourself any goal you want. Most of the pleasure will be had along the way, with every step that takes you closer. The final moment of success is often no more thrilling than the relief of taking off a heavy backpack at the end of a long hike. If you went on the hike only to feel that pleasure, you are a fool. People's judgments about their present state are based on whether it is better or worse than the state to which they have become accustomed. Adaptation is, in part, just a property of neurons: Nerve cells respond vigorously to new stimuli, but gradually they ""habituate,"" firing less to stimuli that they have become used to. Voluntary activities, on the other hand, are the things that you choose to do, such as meditation, exercise, learning a new skill, or taking a vacation. Because such activities must be chosen, and because most of them take effort and attention, they can't just disappear from your awareness the way conditions can. Voluntary activities, therefore, offer much greater promise for increasing happiness while avoiding adaptation effects. Noise, especially noise that is variable or intermittent, interferes with concentration and increases stress. It's worth striving to remove sources of noise in your life. Conflicts in relationships - having an annoying office mate or roommate, or having chronic conflict with your spouse is one of the surest ways to reduce your happiness. You never adapt to interpersonal conflict. It damages every day, even days when you don't see the other person but ruminate about the conflict nonetheless. People who report the greatest interest in attaining money, fame, or beauty are consistently found to be less happy, and even less healthy, than those who pursue less materialistic goals. There is a state many people value even more than chocolate after sex. It is the state of total immersion in a task that is challenging yet closely matched to one's abilities. It is what people sometimes call ""being in the zone."" The keys to flow: - There's a clear challenge that fully engages your attention - You have the skills to meet the challenge - You get immediate feedback about how you are doing at each step Pleasures are delights that have clear sensory and strong emotional components, such as may be derived from food, sex, back-rubs, and cool breezes. Gratifications are activities that engage you fully, draw on your strengths, and allow you to lose self-consciousness. Arrange your day and your environment to increase both pleasures and gratifications. Pleasures must be spaced to maintain their potency. Because the elephant has a tendency to overindulge, the rider needs to encourage it to get up and move on to another activity. The key to finding your own gratifications is to know your own strengths. Buddhist detachment: What would have happened if the young Siddartha had actually descended from his gilded chariot and talked to the people he assumed were so miserable? What if he had interviewed the poor, the elderly, the crippled, and the sick? One of the most adventurous young psychologists, Robert Biswas-Diener (son of the happiness pioneer Ed Diener), has done just that. Buddha's emphasis on detachment may have been the turbulent times he lived in: then, it was foolish to seek happiness by controlling one's external world. But now it is not. People living in wealthy democracies can set long - term goals and expect to meet them. We are immunized against disease, sheltered from storms, etc. Although all of us will get unwanted surprises along the way, we'll adapt and cope with nearly all of them, and many of us will believe we are better off for having suffered. So to cut off all attachments, to shun the pleasures of sensuality and triumph in an effort to escape the pains of loss and defeat - this now strikes me as an inappropriate response to the inevitable presence of some suffering in every life. Calm nonstriving advocated by Buddha is designed to avoid passion, and a life without passion is not a human life. Yes, attachments bring pain, but they also bring our greatest joys, Giving monkeys raisins as a reward for each correct step in solving a puzzle (such as opening a mechanical latch with several moving parts) actually interferes with the solving, because it distracts the monkeys. They enjoy the task for its own sake. If you want your children to grow up to be healthy and independent, you should hold them, hug them, cuddle them, and love them. Give them a secure base and they will explore and then conquer the world on their own. If the model says that mom is always there for you, you'll be bolder in your play and explorations. If the metaphor for passionate love is fire, the metaphor for companionate love is vines growing, intertwining, and gradually binding two people together. People are not allowed to sign contracts when they are drunk, and I sometimes wish we could prevent people from proposing marriage when they are high on passionate love. If you are in passionate love and want to celebrate your passion, read poetry. If your ardor has calmed and you want to understand your evolving relationship, read psychology. If you have just ended a relationship and would like to believe you are better off without love, read philosophy. People in all cultures have a pervasive fear of death. Human beings all know that they are going to die, and so human cultures go to great lengths to construct systems of meaning that dignify life and convince people that their lives have more meaning than those of the animals that die all around them. The extensive regulation of sex in many cultures, the attempt to link love to God and then to cut away the sex, is part of an elaborate defense against the gnawing fear of mortality. Adversity may be necessary for growth because it forces you to stop speeding along the road of life, allowing you to notice the paths that were branching off all along, and to think about where you really want to end up. At an intuitive level, we all believe in karma, the Hindu notion that people reap what they sow. The psychologist Mel Lerner has demonstrated that we are so motivated to believe that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get that we often blame the victim of a tragedy. Letting off steam makes people angrier, not calmer. When people older than thirty are asked to remember the most important or vivid events of their lives, they are disproportionately likely to recall events that occurred between the ages of 15 and 25. This is the age when a person's life blooms - first love, college and intellectual growth, living and perhaps traveling independently - and it is the time when young people (at least in Western countries) make many of the choices that will define their lives. If there is a special period for identity formation, a time when life events are going to have the biggest influence on the rest of the life-story, this is it. Marcel Proust said: We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world. First, wise people are able to balance their own needs, the needs of others, and the needs of people or things beyond the immediate interaction (e.g., institutions, the environment, or people who may be adversely affected later on). Ignorant people see everything in black and white - they rely heavily on the myth of pure evil and they arc strongly influenced by their own self-interest. The wise are able to see things from others' points of view, appreciate shades of gray, and then choose or advise a course of action that works out best for everyone in the long run. Second, wise people are able to balance three responses to situations: adaptation (changing the self to fit the environment) shaping (changing the environment) selection (choosing to move to a new environment). This second balance corresponds roughly to the famous ""serenity prayer"": ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."" ""Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself"" - (Benjamin Franklin) One of the oldest works of direct moral instruction is the Teaching of Amenernope, an Egyptian text thought to have been written around 1300 BCE. Moral education must also impart tacit knowledge - skills of social perception and social emotion so finely tuned that one automatically feels the right thing in each situation, knows the right thing to do, and then wants to do it. Morality, for the ancients, was a kind of practical wisdom. Many moral education efforts since the 1970s take the rider off of the elephant and train him to solve problems on his own. After being exposed to hours of case studies, classroom discussions about moral dilemmas, and videos about people who faced dilemmas and made the right choices, the child learns how (not what) to think. Then class ends, the rider gets hack on the elephant, and nothing changes at recess. Trying to make children behave ethically by teaching them to reason well is like trying to make a dog happy by wagging its tail. It gets causality backwards. A wonderful book - Practical Ethics - by the Princeton philosopher Peter Singer. I have been morally opposed to all forms of factory farming. Morally opposed, but not behaviorally opposed. I love the taste of meat, and the only thing that changed in the first six months after reading Singer is that I thought about my hypocrisy each time I ordered a hamburger. But then, during my second year of graduate school, I began to study the emotion of disgust. I watched in horror as cows, moving down a dripping disassembly line, were bludgeoned, hooked, and sliced up. The sight of red meat made me queasy. My visceral feelings now matched the beliefs Singer had given me. The elephant now agreed with the rider, and I became a vegetarian. I saw the right way and approved it, but followed the wrong, until an emotion came along to provide some force. The modern requirement that ethics ignore particularity is what gave us our weaker morality - applicable everywhere, but encompassing nowhere. Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses. How many of your New Year's resolutions have been about fixing a flaw? And how many of those resolutions have you made several years in a row? Cognitive behavioral therapy really does work! Religion and science each begin with an easy and unsatisfying answer, but then move on to more subtle and interesting explanations. Psychologist Alice Isen went around Philadelphia leaving dimes in pay phones. The people who used those phones and found the dimes were then more likely to help a person who dropped a stack of papers. Happy people are kinder and more helpful than those in the control group. ""Anomie"" (normlessness). Anomie is the condition of a society in which there are no clear rules, norms, or standards of value. In an anomie society, people can do as they please. But without any clear standards or respected social institutions to enforce those standards, it is harder for people to find things they want to do. Asking children to grow virtues, looking only within themselves for guidance, is like asking each one to invent a personal language - a pointless and isolating task if there is no community with whom to speak. Would you prefer that there be a wide variety of opinions and no dominant one? Or would you prefer that everyone agree with you and the laws of the land reflect that agreement? If you prefer diversity on an issue, the issue is not a moral issue for you; it is a matter of personal taste. Remember that the American motto of ""e pluribus, unum"" (from many, one) has two parts. The celebration of pluribus should be balanced by policies that strengthen the unum. The metaphor that has most helped me to understand morality, religion, and the human quest for meaning is Flatland, a charming little hook written in 1884 by the English novelist and mathematician Edwin Abbot. The ethic of autonomy, the ethic of community, and the ethic of divinity: When people think and act using the ethic of autonomy, their goal is to protect individuals from harm and grant them the maximum degree of autonomy, which they can use to pursue their own goals. When people use the ethic of community, their goal is to protect the integrity of groups, families, companies, or nations, and they value virtues such as obedience, loyalty, and wise leadership. When people use the ethic of divinity, their goal is to protect from degradation the divinity that exists in each person, and they value living in a pure and holy way, free from moral pollutants such as lust, greed, and hatred. Cultures vary in their relative reliance on these three ethics, Man is possessed of two natures - a lower, in common with animals, and a higher, peculiar to himself. The whole meaning of sin is the humiliating bondage of the higher to the lower. The modern West is the first culture in human history that has managed to strip time and space of all sacredness and to produce a fully practical, efficient, and profane world. This is the world that religious fundamentalists find unbearable. The great historian of religion Mircea Eliade wrote ""The Sacred and the Profane"" Even a person committed to a profane existence has privileged places, qualitatively different from all others - a man's birthplace, or the scenes of his first love, or certain places in the first foreign city he visited in his youth. Even for the most frankly nonreligious man, all these places still retain an exceptional, a unique quality; they are the ""holy places"" of his private universe, as if it were in such spots that he had received the revelation of a reality other than that in which he participates through his ordinary daily life. Even atheists have intimations of sacredness, particularly when in love or in nature. We just don't infer that God caused those feelings. Awe is the emotion of self-transcendence. The self is the main obstacle to spiritual advancement, in three ways. 1. The constant stream of trivial concerns and egocentric thoughts keeps people locked in the material and profane world, unable to perceive sacredness and divinity. This is why Eastern religions rely heavily on meditation, an effective means of quieting the chatter of the self. 2. Spiritual transformation is essentially the transformation of the self, weakening it, pruning it hack - in some sense, killing it - and often the self objects. Give up my possessions and the prestige they bring? No way! Love my enemies, after what they did to me? Forget about it. 3. Following a spiritual path is invariably hard work, requiring years of meditation, prayer, self-control, and sometimes self-denial. The self does not like to be denied, and it is adept at finding reasons to bend the rules or cheat. Many religions teach that egoistic attachments to pleasure and reputation are constant temptations to leave the path of virtue. In a sense, the self is Satan, or, at least, Satan's portal. Only by seeing the self in this way, can one understand and even respect the moral motivations of those who want to make their society conform more closely to the particular religion they follow. Love and work, for people, are obvious analogues to water and sunshine for plants. When Freud was asked what a normal person should be able to do well, he is reputed to have said, ""Love and work."" We get more pleasure from making progress toward our goals than we do from achieving them. Most people approach their work in one of three ways: as a job, a career, or a calling. - If you see your work as a job, you do it only for the money, you look at the clock frequently while dreaming about the weekend ahead, and you probably pursue hobbies, which satisfy your effectance needs more thoroughly than does your work. - If you see your work as a career, you have larger goals of advancement, promotion, and prestige. - If you see your work as a calling, however, you find your work intrinsically fulfilling you are not doing it to achieve something else. You see your work as contributing to the greater good or as playing a role in some larger enterprise the worth of which seems obvious to you. You have frequent experiences of flow during the work day, and you neither look forward to ""quitting time"" nor feel the desire to shout, ""Thank God it's Friday!"" You would continue to work, perhaps even without pay, if you suddenly became very wealthy. You might think that blue-collar workers have jobs, managers have careers, and the more respected professionals (doctors, scientists, clergy) have callings. But all three orientations represented in almost every occupation examined. Those janitors who worked this way saw their work as a calling and enjoyed it far more than those who saw it as a job. Work at its best, then, is about connection, engagement, and commitment. ""Work is love made visible."" - Khalil Gibran Love and work are crucial for human happiness because, when done well, they draw us out of ourselves and into connection with people and projects beyond ourselves. Happiness comes from getting these connections right. When doing good (doing high-quality work that produces something of use to others) matches up with doing well (achieving wealth and professional advancement), a field is healthy. Genetics, for example, is a healthy field because all parties involved respect and reward the very best science. Journalism into just another profit center where the only thing that mattered was will it sell, and will it outsell our competitors? Good journalism was sometimes bad for business. Journalists who worked for these empires confessed to having a sense of being forced to sell out and violate their own moral standards. Their world was unaligned, and they could not become vitally engaged in the larger but ignoble mission of gaining market share at any cost. A coherent profession, such as genetics, can get on with the business of genetics, while an incoherent profession, like journalism, spends a lot of time on self-analysis and self-criticism. If your lower-level traits match up with your coping mechanisms, which in turn are consistent with your life story, your personality is well integrated and you can get on with the business of living. When these levels do not cohere, you are likely to be torn by internal contradictions and neurotic conflicts. You might need adversity to knock yourself into alignment. And if you do achieve coherence, the moment when things come together may be one of the most profound of your life. If evolution is all about survival of the fittest, then why do people help each other so much? Why do they give to charity, risk their lives to save strangers, and volunteer to fight in wars? Darwin thought the answer was easy: Altruism evolves for the good of the group: There can be no doubt that a tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good would be victorious over most other tribes, and this would be natural selection. The word religion literally means, in Latin, to link or hind together. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge. Liberals are experts in thinking about issues of victimization, equality, autonomy, and the rights of individuals, particularly those of minorities and nonconformists. Conservatives are experts in thinking about loyalty to the group, respect for authority and tradition, and sacredness. When one side overwhelms the other, the results are likely to be ugly. A society without liberals would be harsh and oppressive to many individuals. A society without conservatives would lose many of the social structures and constraints. A good place to look for wisdom is where you least expect to find it: in the minds of your opponents. You already know the ideas common on your own side. If you can take off the blinders of the myth of pure evil, you might see some good ideas for the first time.","Psychology professor's digestible but deep insight into how our minds work, around the topic of happiness.

Influence,Robert Cialdini,006124189X,9,"When we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. The word “because” triggers an automatic compliance response. Instead of stacking all the odds in their favor by trying painstakingly to master each of the things that indicate the worth of turquoise jewelry, they were counting on just one - the one they knew to be usually associated with the quality of any item. They were betting that price alone would tell them all they needed to know. “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.” - Alfred North Whitehead When a man enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a suit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys if he buys them after the suit purchase than before. A real estate agent watches his prospects’ eyes light up when he showed the place he really wanted to sell them after they had seen the run-down houses. “The house I got them spotted for looks really great after they’ve first looked at a couple of dumps.” One of the most potent of the weapons of influence around us - the rule for reciprocation. The rule says that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. Simple mail appeal for donations produces a response rate of about 18 percent. But when the mailing also includes an unsolicited gift (gummed, individualized address labels), the success rate nearly doubles to 35 percent. It is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy to exploit. The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom we wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others. People will often avoid asking for a needed favor if they will not be in a position to repay it. His request that I purchase some one-dollar chocolate bars had been put in the form of a concession on his part: It was presented as a retreat from his request that I buy some five-dollar tickets. If I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to be a concession on my part. As we have seen, there was such a concession: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from a larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in either of the things he offered. It had not mattered that I do not like chocolate bars; the Boy Scout had made a concession to me, click, and, whirr, I responded with a concession of my own. Because the rule for reciprocation governs the compromise process, it is possible to use an initial concession as part of a highly effective compliance technique. The technique is a simple one that we can call the rejection-then-retreat technique. Suppose you want me to agree to a certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then, after I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your requests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own, the only one I would have immediately open to me - compliance with your second request. The rejection-then-retreat tactic spurs people not only to agree to a desired request but actually to carry out the request and, finally, to volunteer to perform further requests. Positive by-products of the act of concession: feelings of greater responsibility for, and satisfaction with, the arrangement. Compared to the two other approaches, the strategy of starting with an extreme demand and then retreating to the more moderate one produced the most money for the person using it. These subjects reported that they had successfully influenced the opponent to take less money for himself. Once a stand had been taken, the need for consistency pressured these people to bring what they felt and believed into line with what they had already done. They simply convinced themselves that they had made the right choice. But because it is so typically in our best interests to be consistent, we easily fall into the habit of being automatically so, even in situations where it is not the sensible way to be. Sometimes it is the cursedly clear and unwelcome set of answers provided by straight thinking that makes us mental slackers. There are certain disturbing things we simply would rather not realize. Because it is a preprogrammed and mindless method of responding, automatic consistency can supply a safe hiding place from those troubling realizations. They very much wanted to believe that meditation was their answer. Now, in the form of my colleague, intrudes the voice of reason, showing the theory underlying their newfound solution to be unsound. Panic! Something must be done at once before logic takes its toll and leaves them without hope again. Quickly, quickly, walls against reason are needed. How several of the big toy companies jack up their January and February sales: They start prior to Christmas with attractive TV ads for certain special toys. The kids want what they see and extract Christmas promises for these items from their parents. Now here’s where the genius of the companies’ plan comes in: They undersupply the stores with the toys they’ve gotten the parents to promise. Most parents find those things sold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value. The toy manufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with plenty of these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, the companies start running the ads again for the other, special toys. That juices up the kids to want those toys more than ever. They go running to their parents whining, “You promised, you promised,” and the adults go trudging off to the store to live up dutifully to their words. A sample of Bloomington, Indiana, residents surveyed, asked to predict what they would say if asked to spend three hours collecting money for the American Cancer Society. Of course, not wanting to seem uncharitable to the survey taker or to themselves, many of these people said that they would volunteer. The consequence of this sly commitment procedure was a 700 percent increase in volunteers when, a few days later, a representative of the American Cancer Society did call. Once he has agreed to a request, his attitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of person who does this sort of thing, A volunteer worker had come to their doors and asked them to accept and display a little three-inch-square sign that read BE A SAFE DRIVER. It was such a trifling request that nearly all of them had agreed to it. But the effects of that request were enormous. Because they had innocently complied with a trivial safe-driving request a couple of weeks before, these homeowners became remarkably willing to comply with another such request that was massive in size. Once you’ve got a man’s self-image where you want it, he should comply naturally with a whole range of your requests that are consistent with this view of himself. Amway Corporation, for instance, has hit upon a way to spur their sales personnel to greater and greater accomplishments. Members of the staff are asked to set individual sales goals and commit themselves to those goals by personally recording them on paper: One final tip before you get started: Set a goal and write it down. Whatever the goal, the important thing is that you set it, so you’ve got something for which to aim - and that you write it down. The more public the better. Whenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a drive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person. The Chinese prisons withheld large prizes in favor of less powerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had done. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A man who suffered through an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he did so for charitable purposes. We should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the things we want them truly to believe in. No matter which variety of lowballing is used, the sequence is the same: An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision Sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed. It seems almost incredible that a customer would buy a car under these circumstances. Yet it works. We feel it in the pit of our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with a request we know we don’t want to perform. Kids watched 23 minutes of a movie showing kids being social and accepted. While the withdrawn children who had not seen this film remained as isolated as ever, those who had viewed it were now leading their schools in amount of social activity. It seems that this 23-minute movie, viewed just once, was enough to reverse a potential pattern of lifelong maladaptive behavior. Such is the potency of the principle of social proof. Why a sports fan is involved in the outcome of the match: Because he, personally, would be diminished by a hometown defeat. How? Through the principle of association. The mere connection of birthplace hooked him, wrapped him, tied him to the approaching triumph or failure. You root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality - and what you want to prove is that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for represents you; and when he wins, you win. The pronoun is “we” designed to imply the closest possible identity with the team. To connect themselves to success by using the pronoun “we” to describe their school-team victory - “We beat Houston, seventeen to fourteen,” or “We won.” In the case of the lost game, however, “we” was rarely used. Instead, the students used terms designed to keep themselves separate from their vanquished team - “They lost to Missouri, thirty to twenty,” or “I don’t know the score, but Arizona State got beat.” It is not when we have a strong feeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to bask in reflected glory. Instead, it will be when prestige (both public and private) is low that we will be intent upon using the successes of associated others to help restore image. Authority status in our culture: the well-tailored business suit. It evokes a telling form of deference from total strangers. The waiter proved to be a trustworthy informant, because he recommended dishes that were slightly less expensive than originally ordered. Rather than trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have the customers’ best interests at heart. To all appearances, he was at once knowledgeable and honest, a combination that gave him great credibility. Something that, on its own merits, held little appeal for me had become decidedly more attractive merely because it would soon become unavailable. I routinely will interrupt an interesting face-to-face conversation to answer the ring of an unknown caller. In such a situation, the caller has a compelling feature that my face-to-face partner does not: potential unavailability. If I don’t take the call, I might miss it (and the information it carries) for good. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value. For instance, homeowners told how much money they could lose from inadequate insulation are more likely to insulate their homes than those told how much money they could save. Convince customers of an item’s scarcity and thereby increase its immediate value in their eyes. When increasing scarcity - or anything else - interferes with our prior access to some item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying to possess the item more than before. Tendency to want what has been banned and therefore to presume that it is more worthwhile. For such people - members of fringe political groups, for example - the most effective strategy may not be to publicize their unpopular views, but to get those views officially censored and then to publicize the censorship. Customers who heard of the impending scarcity via “exclusive” information purchased six times the amount. The drop from abundance to scarcity produced a decidedly more positive reaction to the cookies than did constant scarcity. We are most likely to find revolutions where a period of improving economic and social conditions is followed by a short, sharp reversal in those conditions. Thus it is not the traditionally most downtrodden people - who have come to see their deprivation as part of the natural order of things - who are especially liable to revolt. Instead, revolutionaries are more likely to be those who have been given at least some taste of a better life. When the economic and social improvements they have experienced and come to expect suddenly become less available, they desire them more than ever and often rise up violently to secure them. This pattern offers a valuable lesson for would-be rulers: When it comes to freedoms, it is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given at all. The parent who grants privileges or enforces rules erratically invites rebelliousness by unwittingly establishing freedoms for the child. There was a certain cookie that was the highest rated of all: those that became less available because of a demand for them. As soon as we feel the tide of emotional arousal that flows from scarcity influences, we should use that rise in arousal as a signal to stop short. Panicky, feverish reactions have no place in wise compliance decisions. We need to calm ourselves and regain a rational perspective. In his book Future Shock, Alvin Toffler provided early documentation of the unprecedented and increasing rapidity of modern daily life: we travel more and faster we relocate more frequently to new residences, which are built and torn down more quickly we contact more people and have shorter relationships with them we are faced with an array of choices among styles and products that were unheard of the previous year and may well be obsolete or forgotten by the next. Novelty, transience, diversity, and acceleration are acknowledged as prime descriptors of civilized existence.","Classic book on the psychology of persuasion. I read it 15 years ago, thought about it ever since, and re-read it now. How to get a 700% improvement in volunteers. How to sell more by doubling your prices. How to make people feel they made a choice, when really you made it for them."
Management of the Absurd,Richard Farson,0684830442,9,"If you were asked to predict the group in our society that is most likely to mount a liberation effort to end its oppression, would you have a greater chance of success picking the group for which you feel the most sorry, or the one for which you feel the least sorry? (Least sorry is correct.) Liberation movements usually arise from groups thought at the time to be perfectly content. From where is the leadership of those liberation movements most likely to come? From those most oppressed by the conditions, or those least oppressed? (Least.) The leaders come from outside or from the margins of these groups. Seldom from the most oppressed segments. The opposite of a profound truth is also true. Granting authority is not like handing out a piece of pie, wherein you lose what you give away. It is more like what happens when you give information to someone. Although he or she may now know more, you do not know any less. One exec I know is a classic example of a man who wants to succeed but at the same time seems to want to fail. Everything he does carries both messages. From the very moment he enthusiastically volunteers to head a project, he operates in such a way as to cripple it - refusing to delegate, undermining the work of committees, failing to meet deadlines, and stalling on crucial decisions. Predictions rely heavily on knowledge of present conditions, but present conditions are largely invisible. What parents do makes little difference. What they are really matters. Most children adopt the characteristics that define their parents, whether their parents want them to or not. Any technique loses its power when it becomes evident that it is a technique. Meet each situation armed not with a battery of techniques but with openness. Transcend technique. Ultimately, people discover who we are and come to regard us as we regard them. If we genuinely respect our colleagues and employees, those feelings will be communicated without the need for artifice or technique. And they will be reciprocated. Effective leaders and managers do not regard control as the main concern. Instead, they approach situations sometimes as learners, sometimes as teachers, sometimes as both. They turn confusion into understanding. They see a bigger picture. They trust the wisdom of the group. Their strength is not in control alone, but in other qualities: passion, tenacity, patience, courage, firmness, enthusiasm, wonder. Our most important human affairs - marriage, parenting, education, leadership - do best when there's an occasional loss of control and an increase in personal vulnerability - times when we do not know what to do. Think of the difference between seduction and romance. Technique is required for the former, but is useless in the latter. If you know how to have a romance, it isn't a romance, but a seduction. Not knowing how to do it makes it a romance. Most arguments and conflicts are unconsciously designed to get us to reveal that the other has had an impact on us. When we begin to understand how something works, we think immediately that we will be able to make it work. That may be true in the physical world, but it is far from true in the world of human relations. Technology creates the opposite of its intended purpose. Has the introduction of A/V technology into schools led to better-educated students? Has computer-aided design improved architecture. Face-to-face communication often introduces more ""noise"" in the system and imposes more limitations on personal expression. The very technology that threatens to depersonalize our society offers a way to connect people, to restore a sense of community in our lives, to deepen our relationships. When participants could talk not only to the persons next to them but to all other members of the group, then the problem-solving ability of the group diminished markedly, and it became virtually paralyzed. Many supposed communication problems are actually balance-of-power problems. That's why it's probably unwise to introduce completely open communication into a situation where there is a large disparity in power. The metamessage is more powerful than the message itself. It can be tiring for managers to focus entirely on what the other person means and how he or she sees the world. Ordinarily, humans need more psychological space in which to move in their communication. Listening denies the listener that space. The best kind of listening comes not from technique but from being genuinely interested in what really matters to the other person. There is something graceless and manipulative in analyzing those special moments when we are enriched and exhilarated by someone's listening to us, or being honest with us, or praising us, and teaching them as human relations or management skills. It's like learning memory tricks so you can call someone you barely know by name. Giving praise establishes the fact that you are in a position to sit in judgement. When the work of a high-status person is praised by a low-status person, it is often seen as presumptuous or even insulting. As if an ordinary person told Picasso, ""You're a very good painter."" Compare with a way that respects the status difference, ""I love your painting."" What really does release creativity and promote achivement is when a manager takes the time to get involved in the employee's work - learning what direction the work is taking, the problems and possibilities it presents, the way the employee is dealing with the task. But involvement is demanding and time-consuming, which explains why many managers resort to praise as the substitute, hoping it will accomplish the same result. Giving praise is easy to do. It makes for effortless conversation and demands far less imagination than do witty retorts, penetrating criticism, or brilliant insights. We have civil rights - not only to protect us from bad people, but to protect us from good people as well, from people who think they know what's good for us. Tyrants have always acted in the best interest of their people, or so they thought. Ex-convicts are better able to rehabilitate prison inmates than is the prison staff. Ex-addicts are more successful in getting other addicts off drugs than are psychiatrists. Students learn more from each other than they do from their professors. People tend to be much smarter about their own situations than we give them credit for. A full grasp of any problem is only in the hands of the people who have experienced it. Alcoholics Anonymous, Weight Watchers, Parents Without Partners, Gamblers Anonymous: each of them demonstrates the power of people who are themselves beset with problems, and yet are able to help each other in ways that the professionals have not yet learned to do. Participative management - involving the people who have to do the work in the decisions that will affect them - is based upon the idea that people are better than we think they are and can be counted on to make wise choices. A considerable amount of research shows that people learn faster, produce more, and are more highly motivated when participative methods are employed. It can take an inordinate amount of time and patience to develop a group than can practice participative management. The healthier you are psychologically, or the less you need to change, the more you can change. Psychotherapists have much more to offer such people. What gets organizations into trouble are faulty leadership styles, poor internal relationships, and managerial blind spots. Typically, people want someone else to change, and often for good reason. But for the consultant, the general rule is that the person who can change is the one to work with, and usually that is the person who has brought the situation to the consultant in the first place. Individuals are almost indestructable, but organizations are very fragile. Even the most intense, confrontational, and sometimes traumatic situations rarely damage an indivudual. Yes there is hurt, but seldom is there permanent damage. People survive the most devastating natural disasters in relatively good psychological shape. But relationships can be destroyed with one wrong word, one single act. People suffer most in their lives from failed or failing relationships - parental rejections, marital strife, difficulties with bosses - or from the lack of relationships - isolation, alienation, erosion of community. The best way to deal with individuals may be to improve relationships. The better things are, the worse they feel: THE THEORY OF RISING EXPECTATIONS Revolutions start not when conditions are at their worst, but only after they have begun to improve, reforms have been instituted, leadership has developed, and the populace has come to have a new vision of what might be. Rising expectations fuel the fire of revolution and change because it creates a discrepancy between what people have and what they now see is possible to have. Psychotherapy works the same way. Successful therapy leads not to satisfaction but to new and different feelings of discontent. As people solve lower-order problems that brought them to therapy, instead of becoming contented they become discontented about higher-order issues. The motivation for continuing change and growth comes from the development of higher-quality discontent, then moving on to the solution of more important problems. Maslow called them ""grumbles"": Low-order grumbles are deficiency needs: ""It's too hot in here."" High-order grumbles are ""We need better safety standards."" In a very healthy organization there are ""metagrumbles"": complaints having to do with needs for self-actualization. ""I don't feel that my talents are being fully utilized."" For managers: Improvement does not bring contentment, but its opposite. The way to judge your effectiveness is to assess the quality of discontent you engender. The paradox of rising expectations: in countries making their way toward democratic change there are the most troublesome demands from the population. In China the Tiananmen Square protests erupted after the country's leaders had done more to open China to the world than perhaps any other rulers in the nation's history. They had doubled the wealth of China in a decade, and instututed all manner of quasi-democratic and capitalistic reforms. When they got angry, protesting, thankless students in return,they resorted to the massive repression for which their backgrounds had well-prepared them. The paradox of rising expectations: good marriages that reflect what most people would want in a marriage are more likely to fail than bad ones. We want for ourselves not what we are missing, but more of what we already have. Our absorbtion with what we do well may blind us to what will enable us to do even better. Godfather to the idea of Management of the Absurd: C. Northcote Parkinson: author of Parkinson's Law: ""Work expands to fill the time available."" It may take hours to discuss hundred-dollar items, while million-dollar items fly by. Almost everybody knows something sensible to say about a small item on the budget, but few can offer wise comments about a million-dollar item. We need to fail often. If we don't, it means we're not testing our limits. It means we're not taking the necessary risks to improve our behavior. Learning from success happens when you are on your game, things are working out for you, anything seems possible - and you are stimulated by your achievements. When are are doing a series of things right, it gives us the strength and encouragement to continue - which leads to our greatest successes. On the other hand, a series of failures can demoralize us. Little is more encouraging than learning about another's failure, especially if it is an expert who is failing. Humans relate better to people in their failures than in their successes. ""Whatever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies."" - Gore Vidal Responding to failure seems to bring out something good in us. We know better how to empathize with the person who is suffering than we do with a person who is succeeding. Gossip is the single most community-building and social-bonding experience we have. Sharing stories of others' troubles is what brings us together. Most of our succcesses and failures are due to forces not within our control. Other societies, such as Japan, recognize this better than we do. Organizations are simply not good at changing themselves. They change more often as a result of invasion from the outside or rebellion from the inside. Less so as a result of planning. The situations we try hardest to avoid in our organization would actually be the most beneficial for them. People are pretty good the way they are. (News bias makes us think otherwise.) Better managers try to fix situations, not people, by making structural changes in their organizations. Rather than attempting to change individuals, they are much more likely to change reporting relationships, enlarge or reduce the expectations of the job, etc. Most employees are trying to do the best they can. They prefer to do good work, to cooperate, to meet objectives. They prefer harmony over conflict, action over inaction, productivity over delays. Not everyone, and not all the time. But in general, people want to perform effectively. Managers may have trouble recognizing this because we have never bothered to study human beings at their best. Our efforts are usually attempts to reform people rather than to educate, enlighten, and appreciate them, allowing their best to emerge. An exercise: design an organiztion that would produce the lowest levels of trust among its employees. Answer: make sure everything is locked up, install time clocks, introduce massive manuals of operating procedures, develop rules and regulations on everything. (These are how many organizations look!) What's a high-trust organization look like? Reverse the flow of communication. Develop a set of shared goals. Build a team rather than concentrating only on individuals. Offer rewards rather than punishment. Stay in touch with what is happening on the floor. Pay attention to the concerns, issues, and personal problems of the employees. Enlarge people's jobs. Instead of continuing to want to change these people, all those characteristics that may have concerned us at the outset become qualities we come to appreciate as simply being part of the way these people are. Absurdly, we find that we really wouldn't want it any other way. When we assess people, we make lists of strengths and weaknesses, but we really need a list in the middle for those strengths that are also weaknesses, and weaknesses that are also strengths. Strengths can become weaknesses when we rely too much on them. People who are exceptionally beautiful may fail to build up other qualities. We sometimes say someone has a positive trait ""to a fault"". If strengths are also weaknesses, the reverse can be true. A weakness can be a strength. Fearfulness can serve us well, making us cautious. Perfectionists can be our best workers. The insecure lead the need to achieve. An obsessive executive can inspire others. Better managers recognize that it's more important for them to like their employees, than for their employees to like them. The problem is not in raising the morale of the work force: it's in raising their own morale as managers. Leadership is distributed among members of a group, and they in turn play such vital roles as taskmaster, clown, mother figure, and so on. Relying on one person - the manager - to provide all the leadership builds expectations that cannot be met. It robs the group of its powers, leading to overdependence on the manager. Leaders who successfully move from one organization to another are able to do this because they define their task as evoking the knowledge, skills, and creativity of those who are already with the organization. They are especially able to elicit the intelligence and participation of group members who otherwise might not join the discussions. The best leaders are servants of their people. People who were most successful in achieving power did not dominate the group: rather, they served it. Humility comes natually to the best leaders. They seldom take credit themselves but instead give credit to the group with which they have worked. They characteristically make life easier for their employees. They are constantly aranging situations, engineering jobs, smoothing out the processes, removing the barriers. They think about who needs what. They define their job as finding ways of releasing the creative potential that exists within each individual employee and in each group with which they work. Good employees anticipate what the needs are going to be, then offer solutions not problems, ideas not complaints. Children see events that adults have learned not to notice. Much of the job of executive development is an unlearning process: getting rid of barriers to perception and wisdom and judgement. Leadership is not a matter of expertise. We wouldn't want ""expert"" friends, ""expert"" wifes, lovers, or parents. With the right kind of education, managers can gain better self-understanding, learn about their own interpersonal styles, their reactions to and impact on others, prejudices and blind spots, strengths and weaknesses. A better understanding of themselves and of their feelings gives all managers added trust in their perceptions, reactions, impulses, and instincts. If any one thing can be said to be true about good leaders, it's that they trust their instincts. Managers become like good hosts at a party, making certain that everything works smoothly, taking care of the little things that make the experience a good one. The best leaders make their organizations places where their passion becomes the organizing force. ""Amateur"" comes from Latin ""amator"", which means ""lover"". Frank Capra: ""Lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for."" They tend to be the most important, most humane ones. They require us to live up to the best that is in us. To perfect ourselves and our world. Whenever I have the arrogance or audacity to believe that I can reform people, I get nowhere. But when I fundamentally recognize that I cannot possibly accomplish those reforms, I can move ahead with a more humble posture and paradoxically perhaps then there is a chance that the situation can change. Advice is cheap. It costs nothing to give. It's the simplest, quickest response to make when confronted with a problem. It addresses a situation without actually dealing with it. It is easier than understanding, listening, and analyzing. ""I already know how to be twice as good a farmer as I am.""","Counter-intuitive lessons about management. Highly recommended for managers and leaders, but also teachers and parents."
Predictably Irrational,Dan Ariely,006135323X,9,"Most people don't know what they want unless they see it in context. We don't know what kind of racing bike we want until we see it in the Tour De France. We don't know what kind of speaker system we like until we hear a set of speakers that sounds better than the previous one. We don't know what we want to do with our lives - until we find a relative or friend who is doing just what we think we should be doing. Everything is relative, and that's the point. Like an airplane pilot landing in the dark, we want runway lights on either side of us, guiding us to the place where we can touch down our wheels. The decoy effect : is is the secret agent in more decisions than we could imagine. For vacation, choosing between Rome and Paris. Tough choice! Don't know. Offer a 3rd option : Rome without the free breakfast. Call it ""-Rome"", or the decoy. Now considering 3 options: Rome, -Rome, Paris. The comparison with the clearly inferior option makes Rome with the free breakfast seem even better. -Rome makes Rome look so good that you judge it to be even better than the difficult-to-judge Paris. Arbitrary coherence. (""baby duckling""). Anchoring. Imprinting. Once prices are established in our mind, they shape not only what we are willing to pay for an item, but also how much we are willing to pay for related products. (This makes them coherent.) Important clarification: price tags themselves are not anchors. They become anchors when we contemplate buying a product or service at that particular price. That's when the imprint is set. From then on, we are willing to accept a range of prices, but we will always refer back to the original anchor. People who move to a new city remain anchored to the prices they paid for housing in their former city. People who move from cheap to moderate cities don't increase their spending to fit the new market. They spend what they were used to in the previous market, even sacrificing comfort. ==== THE FALLACY OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND How did Starbucks charge more for coffee, then? If we were previously anchored to the prices at Dunkin' Donuts, how did we move our anchor to Starbucks? Schultz worked diligently to separate Starbucks from other coffee shops, not through price, but ambience - to feel like continental coffeehouse. Where everyone else had small, medium, large - Starbucks had short, tall, grande, venti, as well as drinks with high-pedigree names like Caffé Americano, Caffé Misto, and Frappuchino. Starbucks did everything in its power to make the experience feel different. So different that we would not use the prices at Dunkin' Donuts as an anchor, but instead would be open to the new anchor that Starbucks was preparing for us. Teacher said he was going to be reading Walt Whitman poetry that Friday evening, and due to limited space had to run an auction to determine who could attend. Before the auction, though, he privately asked half the students to write down whether, hypothetically, they would be willing to pay him $10 for a 10-minute poetry reading - and the other half to write down whether, hypothetically, they would be willing to listen to him recite poetry for 10 minutes if he paid them $10. This, of course, served as the anchor. Then he asked for the students to bid on the poetry reading. Those who answered the hypothetical question about paying him were willing to pay. They offered, on average, $1, $2, $3 for short, medium, long reading. Those who answered the hypothetical question about being paid demanded payment. On average, they wanted $1.30, $2.70, $4.80 for short, medium, long reading. Like Tom Sawyer's fence, he was able to take an ambiguous experience and make it into a pleasurable or painful experience. Mark Twain quote: Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. There are wealthy men who drive 4-horse passenger coaches 20-30 miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money, but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work, and they would resign. We decide whether or not to eat burgers, smoke, run red lights, marry, have children, vote Republican, etc. Theory says we base these decisions on our fundamental values - our likes and dislikes. But could it be that the lives we have so carefully crafted are largely just a product of arbitrary coherence? Could it be that we made arbitrary decisions at some point in the past and have built our lives on them ever since, assuming the original decisions were wise? Is that how we choose our careers, spouses, clothes, and hairstyle? Were these just partially random first imprints that have run wild? We can actively improve on our irrational behaviors. Start by becoming aware of our vulnerabilities. If you're planning on a purchase, ask yourself: - How did that habit begin? - What amount of pleasure will you be getting out of it? - Is the pleasure as much as you thought you would get? - Could you cut back a little and better spend the remaining money on something else? Train yourself to question your repeated behaviors. In particular, pay attention to the first decision you make in what is going to be a long stream of decisions. (Clothing, food, etc.) When we face such a decision, it may seem this is just one decision without large consequences, but in fact the power of the first decision has a long-lasting effect that will percolate for years to come. ==== THE COST OF ZERO COST: A table set up in a busy area, offering chocolate: Lindt truffle = 27 cents. Hershey's Kiss = 2 cent. Result? 75% chose truffle, 25% chose kiss. Lindt truffle = 15 cents. Hershey's Kiss = 1 cent. Result? 73% chose truffle, 27% chose kiss. Lindt truffle = 14 cents. Hershey's Kiss = free. Result? 31% chose truffle, 69% chose kiss. Rational economic theory would have said that as the everything between the situations was the same, th customers should have chosen the truffle by the same margin of preference. ""FREE!"" makes us do irrational things : you go to the store to get good hiking socks, but come out with a package of cheap bad socks because it came with a ""FREE!"" second pair. Or buying an expensive HDTV becomes it comes with free Blu-Ray DVDs. Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is ""FREE!"" we forget the downside. ""FREE!"" gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is. Why? Because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss. The real allure of ""FREE!"" is tied to this fear. There's no visible possibility of loss. We can use ""FREE!"" to drive social policy. Want people to drive electric cars? Don't just lower the registration and inspection fee, make it free! If health is a concern, focus on early detection as a way to eliminate the progression of severe illness. Make these critical procedures free. Most policy strategists don't realize that ""FREE!"" is an ace in their hand. It's counterintuitive, but in these times of budget cutbacks, making something free can have a great deal of power. ==== THE COST OF SOCIAL NORMS: We live simultaneously in two different worlds: one where social norms prevail, and one where market norms make the rules. Social norms include friendly requests that people make of one another. ""Could you help me move this couch?"" Social norms are wrapped up in our social nature and our need for community. They are usually warm and fuzzy. Instant paybacks are not required. Like moving a couch or opening a door, you are not expected to immediately reciprocate. Market norms have nothing warm and fuzzy. The exchanges are sharp-edged: wages, prices, rents, interest, costs-and-benefits. Market relationships are not necessarily mean or evil - they also include self-reliance, inventiveness, and individualism - but they do imply comparable benefits and prompt payments. When you are in the domain of market norms, you get what you pay for - that's just the way it is. When we keep social norms and market norms on their separate paths, life hums along pretty well. Sex, for instance: free in social context, where it's warm and emotionally nourishing. But market sex, on demand, costs money. Woody Allen: ""The most expensive sex is free sex."" AARP asked lawyers if they would offer less expensive services to needy retirees, at something like $30/hr. Overhwelmingly said no. They asked the lawyers if they would offer free services to needy retirees. Overwhelmingly said yes. Similar when asking people to help move a couch: ask them to do it for free, and they'll say yes. Offer to pay them a dollar, and they say no. LESSON : Once market norms enter our considerations, the social norms depart. Using gifts is not seen as market norms (giving someone chocolates as a present for helping) - but putting a cost on the gift (""50-cent Snickers bar"", ""5-dollar Godiva chocolates"") does make it market norms. Great example: Day care center had a problem with parents picking up the kids late, so they added a fine. But now that parents were paying for their tardiness, they could decide for themselves whether to be late or not, and they more-often chose to be late. A few weeks later the day care removed the fine, there was another slight increase in tardiness, now that social norms and market norms had both been removed. LESSON: When a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm goes away for a long time. Social norms are not easy to re-establish. As a company, remember that you can't have it both ways. You can't treat your customers like family one moment then treat them impersonally - as a nuisance or competitor - a moment later when this becomes more convenient or profitable. If you want a social relationship, go for it, but remember that you have to maintain it under all circumstances. ==== THE INFLUENCE OF AROUSAL When you are in one state, and try to predict your behavior in another state, you'll get it wrong. ==== THE PROBLEM OF PROCRASTINATION AND SELF-CONTROL Like the influence of arousal, we can be sensible in a cool state, and say we're going to save money or eat wisely. But in the heat of the moment, when we see something we crave, we are in a hot emotional moment, and do not act as we predict. Giving up long-term goals for immediate gratification is procrastination. Students did their assignments best when forced to obey a schedule, instead of letting them choose for themselves (since procrastination takes over). If this lesson is applied to society, government could force required health exams the way we get tickets for jaywalking or having seat belts undone. What if colonosopy gave you a $200 refund if you went, nonrefundable if you didn't show up? The self-control credit card: cutomers decide in advance how much money they wanted to spend in each category, per store, per time-frame. For example: $20 on coffee per week, or $600 on clothes every 6 months, or no candy between 2pm and 6pm. If they surpass their limit, cardholders select their penalties. The card could be rejected, or they could tax themselves and send the tax to Habitat for Humanity, a friend, or long-term savings. Or it could email your spouse. ==== THE HIGH PRICE OF OWNERSHIP The ""endowment effect"": when we own something, we begin to value it more than other people do. Bunch of people wait in line for football tickets. They're handed out on a lottery system. Some get them, others don't, but they all waited the same time. Ask people who don't have a ticket how much they'll be willing to pay to buy one, and they'll say $175. Ask ticket-holders how much they'd be willing to sell theirs for, they say $2400. We assume other people will see the transaction as we do. We expect the buyer of our car to share our feelings, emotions, and memories. They see the smoke or mold. It's as hard for the buyer to imagine the seller's point of view as it is for the seller to imagine the buyer's. The more work you put into something, the more ownership you feel for it. The Ikea effect. We can start to feel ownership before we own something. (Danger of bidding on Ebay.) Ownership changes perspective. Moving backwards to our pre-ownership state is a loss we cannot abide. While moving up in life, we indulge ourselves with the fantasy that we can always ratchet ourselves back if need be, but in reality, we can't. Downgrading to a smaller home is experienced as a loss. ==== THE EFFECT OF EXPECTATIONS Students who got beer with 3 drops of vinegar liked it. But if they were told in advance it had vinegar, they didn't. If you tell people up-front that something might be distasteful, the odds are they will end up agreeing with you. Students who were told about the vinegar after tasting the beer liked it much better - as much as the ones who didn't know it had vinegar at all. With sample coffee : when presented with test-taste coffee in styrofoam cups, people said it tasted cheap. When the same coffee was presented in nice cups, saucers and spoons, they said it tasted expensive. (And they'd be willing to pay more for it.) Stereotypes: Asians good at math, women worse at math. Asian women were asked to take a math exam. Half were asked questions about being a woman first, and they did worse on the test. Half were asked questions about being Asian first, and they did better on the test. ==== THE POWER OF PRICE When given a placebo pill, told it was a pain pill, almost all people felt the pain-relieving effects when told it was very expensive ($2.50 per pill). But when told it was only 10 cents, only half felt the effects. For people with recent pain-medicine experience, it was even more extreme. They had recently learned first-hand that you get what you pay for. ==== CONTEXT OF OUR CHARACTER The students who could only remember one or two of the ten commandments were just as affected by them as the students who remembered all ten. It was not the commandments themselves that encouraged honesty, but the mere contemplation of a moral benchmark of some kind. People cheat when they have a chance to do so, but don't cheat as much as they could. Once they begin thinking about honesty (Ten Commandments, etc) - they stop cheating completely. When we are removed from any benchmarks of ethical thought, we tend to stray into dishonesty. If we are reminded of morality at the moment we are tempted, then we are much more likely to be honest. Cheating is often one step removed from cash. (Accounting practices, backdated stock options, lobbyists sending politicians on vacations.) Taking a red pencil from work is easy. Taking 10 cents from the petty cash drawer in order to buy a pencil is not so easy. At a college dorm, he put 10 cans of coke in shared fridges, and they all disappeared. He put 10 $1 bills on a plate in the fridge and they all stayed. Test given with 10 hard questions, paid $1 for each correct answer. Group #1: Had no way to cheat. Got 3.5 questions correct. Group #2: Told to tear up their sheet afterwards and just tell someone how many they got correct: 6.2 correct. Group #3: Same as #2, but told someone how many they got correct just to get tokens, which then someone elsewhere turned to dollars: 9.4 correct. Given a chance, people cheat. ==== BEER AND FREE LUNCHES When people order out loud in a restaurant, they choose differently than when they order privately. People often feel they have to order something different than companions. (In Hong Kong, people felt they had to order the same thing as their companions.) People who ordered out loud were also not has happy with their selections afterwards. Knowing this, it's best to plan your order before the waiter arrives, and stick with it. Alternative is to get people to order anonymously. Standard economics believes all human decisions are rational and informed, motivated by an accurate concept of the worth of all goods and services, and the amount of happiness all decisions are likely to produce. Under this assumption, everyone in the marketplace is trying to maximize profit and striving to optimize his experiences. Economic theory says there are no free lunches. If there were any, someone would have already found them and extracted all their value. Behavioral economics believes that people are susceptible to irrelevant influences from their immediate environment (context effects), irrelevant emotions, shortsightedness, and other forms of irrationality as shown in this book. The good news is that these mistakes also provide opportunities for improvement. If we all make systematic mistakes in our decisions, then why not develop new stratgies, tools, and methods to help us make better decisions and improve our overall well-being? That's exactly the meaning of free lunches from the perspective of behavioral economics. Although irrationality is commonplace, it does not necessarily mean that we are helpless. Once we understand when and where we make erroneous decisions, we can try to be more vigilant, force ourselves to think differently about these decisions, or use technology to overcome our inherent shortcomings. This is also where businesses and policy makers could revise their thinking and consider how to design their policies and products so as to provide free lunches.",My favorite type of book: pointing out and understanding all of the counter-intuitive things people do.
The Ultimate Sales Machine,Chet Holmes,1591842158,9,"Mastery is a direct result of pigheaded discipline and determination. Becoming a master of karate was not about learning 4000 moves, but about doing just a handful of moves 4000 times. Market data can motivate purchasing when people might not even feel they need the product. ** TIME MANAGEMENT SECRETS OF BILLIONAIRES No one should have more than six direct reports. Be an absolute expert in managing your own time and have the systems in place to make sure that everyone in your organization is skilled in time management as well. Break the company down into (9) ""impact areas"" and hold weekly one-hour meetings in each area. An impact area is any part of your company that has a direct impact on the bottom line. Your impact areas may include sales, customer service, project development, marketing, for example. In order to improve and perfect each of these areas you need to give them a dedicated one hour per week when everyone involved can focus exclusively on improving that area. To-dos, tasks, and deadlines must be assigned after every meeting, but don't ask for too much to be completed. Police these six simple steps throughout your entire staff: #1 : Touch it once If you touch it, take action. Don't open that email or letter until you're ready to deal with it. #2 : Make lists List the 6 most important things you need to do, and get those things completed each day. #3 : Plan how much time you will allocate to each task If one or more of the items on your list is too big to accomplish in one day, then write down how much time during that day you will dedicate to it. What important initiatives are you just not getting to because they take too much time? Do them in small chunks of time. #4 : Plan the day Write out an hour-by-hour schedule, and stick to it. #5 : Prioritize Put the most important task first Get your people productive by examining how they're prioritizing and planning their day, every day. #6 : Ask ""Will it hurt me to throw this away?"" 80% of all filed or stored information is never referred to again. So why hold on to it? When something interferes with your schedule, deal with it and then go back to your schedule! ** INSTITUTING HIGHER STANDARDS AND REGULAR TRAINING Only 10% of the population has ""the learning mind-set"", that seek out and enjoy learning. The other 90% will not look to improve their skills unless they have to as part of their job requirement. Make classroom-style training programs with policies and procedures for everything. Improving and advancing the skills and professionalism of every person in your company is an ongoing process, and formal training sessions should be regular and nonnegotiable. Does your company pass this test? + All employees perform each aspect of their job with a high degree of excellence and consistency + Results are somewhat predictable because training and skills are consistent + Each supervisor would give a similar answer for each question or problem + Each employee would give a similar answer for each question or problem + Client treatment is similar, no matter who the client deals with in our company or department + All staff members know what is considered good performance or attitude. Let's not have people making up what they're going to do in a crisis or in any other situation in your company or department. Have them know what to do in every situation because you address it weekly. Constantly teach the same information again and again until the skill is permanent. To begin a training session, people should be told what to expect: * - What will be covered * - How long it will take * - How the information will be covered * - The objective of the particular session * - The obtained skill or knowledge you hope they will gain When people have a clear understanding of what they are about to hear and see, they will be mentally prepared and focused for the training. It's important to create a training environment that is conducive to learning. Make it fun! People should look forward to it because they know it will be interesting and stimulating. We retain the most information if we are actively involved, role playing or other learning exercises. It's good to mix a few methods: - Lecture Format - Group Questions - Group Discussions - Demonstration Training - Role Playing - How Seats - Case Studies - Test Before and After - The Spot Quiz - Workshop Training Do ongoing and continuing technology training, so that all employees know how to use the technology they have in the fastest most efficient way possible. What's your training plan? What kind of training are you going to provide? Who? Which departments or people need what kind of training? Why? What's the impact going to be? When are you going to conduct the training? How? What methods will you use and why are they best for the material you'll cover? Developing a regular and consistent training program will enable you to effectively and systematically accomplish the following: - Train new employees who can hit the ground running - Upgrade knowledge and skills of existing employees so that everything they do works better, smarter, faster - Provide continuous professional development so your staff becomes more and more effective - Solve any and all problems that come up in your organization ** EXECUTING EFFECTIVE MEETINGS Constant attention to the 3 Ps : Planning, Procedures, and Policies Hold regular, highly productive, workshop-style meetings dedicated to improving every aspect of your business. In each of these meetings, focus all of the relevant people on fixing just one small part of the business. Together, brainstorm plans for how to improve this specific area, draft procedures to test, and ultimately create carved-in-stone company policies that everyone will be trained to follow. Have systems in place that would make hiring 50 people every week a breeze. This makes the difference between success and failure. A company that thinks like a small company remains small. A company, even a one-person army, that thinks and acts like a big company is going to grow faster, smarter, and better. ""What if I were hiring 50 people next week and I wanted all of them to enter the business and quickly be able to perform at peak levels? What kind of a training program do I need in place to do that?"" Here an entire side business has been born : selling telephone follow-up to dealerships that can't figure how to properly manage that practice internally. Don't dictate what the follow-up should be. That is a mistake most executives make. Have meetings where these things are discussed and developed. Have great follow-up procedures, but the folks in the trenches can help develop them. They will buy in much better to procedures that they themselves helped to create. A typical problem : The CEO believes he has to think of all the solutions to every problem. If you have a good staff, the only thing you need to bring to a meeting is your judgement. Work together on a problem, developing the ideas and insights to propel the company forward. The ideas you generate as a group are light-years ahead of what any one of you, including the CEO, would have created on your own. Ask every person to give 3 examples of how to improve some aspect of the company or department. The group will work together and each person will be listened to with respect. Once you have a list of things you need to work on to improve your business, each one of those items needs its own workshop to solve the problems or remove the obstacles. Post-workshop memo says new procedure developed as result of meeting. (""Here are 9 things you can do when a customer is unhappy."") That goes into a procedure book that becomes a training manual for all new people. Save the dailies, too, and at the end of the year you will have 50-100 pages that document a year's worth of workshops. Develop a hierarchy of solutions the customer service reps could offer to keep a customer happy. Each rep is authorized to offer a solution. If the customer is still unhappy, the rep can offer another solution. If customer is still unhappy, a 3rd solution. Only then if all those fail does the rep need to get a supervisor involved. Great workshop question : What is something else you can offer the buyer at the point of sale? One out of 3 people will buy something else if offered at the point of sale. Have participants in the group write down every single idea that comes to them. Give everyone a few minutes to work on this. Don't let them call out ideas. Leader must participate as well. 2 minutes should be enough. Vote on which ideas would work best. People's opinions change as collective intelligence of group is shared. Get consensus. Look at all, then rank #1-3. TEN STEPS TO IMPLEMENT ANY NEW POLICY: 1. Get everyone to feel the pain 2. Hold a workshop to generate solutions 3. Develop a conceptual solution or procedure 4. Leader personally performs procedure or task 5. Set a deadline for testing the conceptual procedure 6. Document step-by-step procedure or process 7. Have show-and-tell role playing 8. Have another workshop on how to improve 9. Monitor the procedure directly 10. Measure and reward the outcome ""What if it took a little extra work in the beginning to gain this learning curve, but once you had it, would dramatically reduce many if not all of these challenges?"" People respect what you inspect. Rewarding comes last. Set very specific criteria for rewarding your team. Make a big deal out of the reward process. People work even harder for recognition than money. *** BECOMING A BRILLIANT STRATEGIST A strategy is a carefully defined and detailed plan to achieve a long-term goal. In business, a strategy is the overall impact, the ultimate position you would like to achieve in the market. To think like a brilliant strategist, you will design and combine your tactics with the long-term strategy in mind. You'll constantly ask yourself and your team, ""How many strategic objectives can we accomplish with each tactic?"" 90% of CEOs are ""tactical"" : only looking at making today's sale. No strategy. 9% of CEOs are ""strategic"" : developing high-level strategy, creating concepts and strategies that almost never develop. but not good at tactics and implementation. Be the 1% : The executive who thinks both tactically and strategically can develop the big ideas and the big strategies and also use discipline and determination to see those brilliant strategies implemented at the tactical level. The strategist looks at every challenge as an opportunity to out-think the competitive approaches. EDUCATION-BASED MARKETING: The purpose of buyer education is to create brand loyalty : a large and loyal following of customers who automatically come there first. People will pay more if they perceive there is a greater value or deeper reason for buying from one provider over another. If most of your buyers are not experts at what to look for in your product or service, this opens a gaping strategic opportunity for the brilliant strategist to capitalize on. Every buyer can be taught how to be a better buyer of your type of product or service. Who is the ideal person in your audience? Who is in your stadium, for your stadium pitch? If you say, ""I'm here to tell you why we have the greatest office equipment in the world"", you're going to have 90% of the audience leave. Re-think the stadium title. This approach of offering some education of value to them gives you a significant opportunity to attract more buyers and build more credibility. You will attract way more buyers if you are offering to teach them something of value to them, than by trying to sell them your product or service. Offering an education that helps the buyer is giong to get more buyer interest. If the information is actually good and useful, it automatically repositions you in the mind of the buyer as much more of an expert than your competitors. You're teaching them things about their own business that they might not know. If you think and plan strategically, you will find a way to weave that information in such a way that ultimately sells your service far better than you could ever sell by simply flat-out pitching your product. When you sell, you break rapport. When you educate, you build it. Train every single salesperson with a massive amount of information. Data makes your information work harder. The more complex your product or service, the better the opportunity to appear as an expert. Your competitors will be more concerned about selling product than about positioning themselves as experts. List your strategic objectives. For each, what would make you more respected? What would position you as an expert in the eye of the buyer? Keep track of everything you find (in the news, etc) that could be of value to your customers. *** HIRING SUPERSTARS People who are eager to please, always looking for more to do, always wanting more responsibility, always wanting to know more than you think they need to know. They're worth every penny if you properly channel their energy. List 3 initiatives that you'd love to hire someone to execute in which the reward could be great if the person did an excellent job for you. Write down what it would mean to have a superstar in that position. Write down what you could afford to pay them if they performed. Based on that, put an ad in the paper using the highest possible figure as bait. Write down the personality profile you think would make someone succeed in that job. DISC personality profile : Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Compliance. Ad : ""Superstars only. $50k to $300k. Don't even call unless you are an overachiever and can prove it. Come build an empire within our company."" Background is not relevant. Someone ""has the stuff"" or doesn't. (?) INTERVIEWING: (NOTE: THIS IS MOSTLY AIMED AT FINDING SALES PEOPLE!) First thing you do is reject them. You're looking for the unique personality profile that becomes more effective in the face of adversity. A superstar will start to question your reasoning - and may even tell you that you're wrong. Prescreening call : Say, ""The ad said don't even apply unless you think you're the best. So why should we interview you?"" You can do this even before telling them what the job is. Test their ego. Once they start talking, say, ""I'm not really hearing superstar. I'm not hearing top producer."" The good ones should disagree, and tell you why they are. The idea candidates will try to qualify you just as they would a prospective client! Step 1 : Relax Ask them to write down 5 questions you want to be asked in the interview, that will show your best side. Step 2 : Probe Explain that your company hires based on personality profile rather than background and ask them directly, ""Do you agree this is more pertinent?"" When they say yes, say that you'd like to find out what shaped them, and start with their childhood. Get OK first. Probing childhood is essential because self-confidence is shaped early in life. * Background: ""What events or influences from your childhood shaped who you are today?"" ""What are some of the biggest challenges in your life? They need not be work-related."" ""What was the toughest sale you ever made?"" * Areas of accomplishment - how much of an overachiever in any area: ""Tell me about a time in your life when the odds were stacked against you, but you overcame them and succeeded."" ""Tell me 3 or 4 things of which you are most proud."" ""Have you ever practiced and reached a high level in any area beyond just getting by in life?"" * Empathy and ability to bond with others: ""How would your best friend describe you?"" ""Of everyone you know, who has the most faith in you? Why?"" ""What are your best memories?"" (look for long answers who try to win you over with tales of their past) * Ask candidates to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 10 in these areas: Ambition Confidence Ability to face rejection Establishing rapport Qualifying skills Ablity to create desire in others Closing skills Time management Presentation skills Strategic thinking Market knowledge Self-improvement Getting around gatekeepers (top producers will rate themselves high in all areas, but so will dreamers who are trying to hide insecurity.) * How do they measure themselves against the best of the best? ""Who is the best salesperson you've ever met?"" If they say themselves, they're hired. If they say someone else, ask what differentiates them from the person they named. * How dedicated are they to self-improvement? Ask what the last self-help book they read * Go through their résumé: Why did you leave your last job? Were you unhappy? Why? Tell me about a disappointment or disagreement you've had with a boss and what happened. Name two weak points of previous bosses. Name two instances when a supervisor criticized you. (Don't react negatively to anything they say, or they'll shut down.) Step 3 : Attack Say thank you this is all wonderful, but I don't really get the impression you're a superstar. Be tactful, but not soft, when looking for salespeople. Don't say something weak like, ""You haven't convinced me yet."" Superstars never crumble. They have tremendous faith in themselves. They have to really believe you think they don't have the stuff. Make all candidates sell themselves at least a little for every position. As long as you're willing to pay, even just on performance, you might be shocked to find there's someone perfect who will build your company for you as long as you share the wealth as they do so. The key to keeping superstars is never say no to them. Instead, redirect their energy or give them a few hurdles to jump in order to get what they want. The more you challenge superstars, the more you encourage them to overachieve. But don't forget to compliment them when they meet and exceed your challenge.","After reading E-Myth Revisited, this is the best book I’ve seen on how to turn it into real results, step-by-step. Not ambiguous. Very “do it like this”."
The 4-Hour Work Week,Tim Ferriss,52287067,9,"DEFINITION: What would you do if you had $100M? Do the minimum necessary for maximum effect. Inactivity is not the goal. Doing what excites you is. The point is not to buy things, but to do what you want to do, be who you want to be. If this includes tools and gadgets, so be it, but they are a means to an end or bonuses, not the point. Be neither the boss nor employee, but the owner. To own the trains, and have someone else ensure they run on time. Most material wants are just justifications for spending time on the things that don't really matter, such as buying things and preparing to buy things. It's not about the big pay-off some day, it's about immediate cash flow every day. After years of repetitive work, you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies which you have let atrophy. ""You must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool."" - Richard Feynman Living in luxury in various places around the world costs less than rent in the United States. If you can free your time and location, your money is automatically worth 3-10 times as much. Money is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W's you control in your life : What you do, When you do it, Where you do it, and Who you do it with. (He calls this the ""freedom multiplier"".) With this criteria, the rich-but-tied-down banker is less ""powerful"" than the person who makes $40k but only works a few hours a week, and can choose all his Ws. Options - the ability to choose - is real power. How to see and create those options with the least effort and cost. A 15-month exploration of the globe by sailboat costs $18,000. If everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way, and the results are subpar, it's time to ask, ""What if I did the opposite?"" Retirement should not be a goal. It assumes you dislike what you are doing for most of your physically capable years, and nothing can justify that sacrifice. Distribute ""mini retirements"" throughout life instead of hoarding them for the end. (He says he aims for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning for every 2 months of work projects.) Conditions are never perfect. ""Someday"" is a disease. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it's important to you and you want to do it ""eventually"", just do it and correct the course along the way. It is far more fun and lucrative to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix your weaknesses. An excess of idle time is poisonous. ""If I only had more money"" is the easiest way to postpone the decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment now, not later. Using money as a scapegoat. Measure money not by total-income but $/hr. Aim for $5000/hr for your time. Write down the worst thing that could happen. Really really terrible where everything goes wrong. Realize it's not that bad. ""There's no difference between a pessismist who says 'Oh it's hopeless don't bother doing anything' - and an optimist who says 'Everything's fine - don't bother doing anything'. Either way, nothing happens."" ""You have comfort. You don't have luxury. Don't tell me that money plays a part. The luxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought. It is the reward of those who have no fear of discomfort."" - Jean Cocteau What are you putting off, out of fear? What is it costing you (financially, emotionally, physically) - to postpone action? What are you waiting for? Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic. It's lonely at the top. 99% of the world is convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre. Therefore, competition is fiercest for ""realistic"" goals. Easier to raise $10M than $1M. Easier to pick up the one ""perfect 10"" in a bar, than the 5 ""8""s. Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance needed to the end. Realistic goals are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first couple hurdles, then you give up. Excitement is a more practical synonym for happiness, and is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. Don't ask ""What do I want?"" or ""What are my goals?"" - but : ""WHAT WOULD EXCITE ME?"" Boredom is the enemy, not failure. Dreamlining: 1. Goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps. 2. Goals have to be unrealistic to be effective. 3. It focuses on the activities that will fill the vaccuum when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things. What would you do if you could not fail? What would you do, day-to-day, if you had $100M in the bank? What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day? Convert each ""being"" into a ""doing"". Example: ""fluent in Chinese"" becomes ""have a 5 minute conversation with a Chinese co-worker"". What 4 dreams would change it all, in the next 6-12 months? Determine the cost of these dreams, and cacluate target monthly income for both timelines. I'm not a believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. I set 3-6 months dreamlines. The future becomes an excuse for postponing action. If the next state is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of spending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. Find someone who's done it and ask them how. Schedule a meeting you'll feel bad cancelling. The most important actions are never comfortable. Propose solutions instead of asking for them. Elicit desired responses instead of react. Be assertive without burning bridges. Develop the uncommon habit of making decisions, for yourself and others. ELIMINATION ""One does not accumulate, but eliminate. It is not daily increase, but daily decrease. The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity."" - Bruce Lee Being busy is a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions. Don't confuse efficient with effective. The best door-to-door salesperson in the world can be incredibly efficient, yet nowhere near as effective as a bad spammer. Someone who checks email 30 times a day, has an elaborate system of organizing, might be incredibly efficient but not effective. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important. What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is useless unless applied to the right things. ""What gets measured gets managed."" - Peter Drucker The Pareto Principle : the 80/20 rule. 80% of consequences flow from 20% of causes. 80% of results come from 20% of effort/time. 80% of profits come from 20% of products/customers. The ratio is often skewed more towards 90/10 or even 95/5, but at least 80/20. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? Find your inefficiencies and eliminate them. Find your strengths and multiply them. I stopped contacting 95% of my customers, fired 2% of them, leaving me with the top 3% of producers to profile and duplicate. Applies to advertising, partners, etc. Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness : lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being overwhelmed is as unproductive as doing nothing, and far more unpleasant. Being selective - doing less - is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few, and ignore the rest. Lack of time is actually a lack of priorities. Parkinson's law: a task will swell in complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution. Learn to ignore or redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportantnt, or unactionable. Most are all three. If you're an employee, spending time on nonsense is not your fault. There is no incentive to use time well unless you are paid on commission. Time is wasted because there is so much time available. Entrepreneurs are those that make things happen. Parkinson's law : a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it's 6 days of making a moutain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, god forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus. **** There are 2 approaches for increasing productivity: **** 1. Limit tasks to the important, to shorten work time (80/20 rule) **** 2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's law) **** The best solution is to use both together : identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income, and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines. If you haven't defined the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what's critical : without deadlines that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur), will swell to consume time until another bit of minutea jumps in to replace it. Most inputs are useless and time is wasted in proportion to the amount that is available. Fat-free performance and time freedom begins with limiting intake overload. You need a Low-Information Diet. 3 times per day, at schedules times, ask yourself: Am I being productive, or just active? Am I inventing things to do, to avoid the important? Focus on demonstrating results instead of showing dedication. (1) - Define a short to-do list. (2) - Define a not-to-do list. If you had a heart attack and had to work 2 hours per day, what would you do? If you had a heart attack and had to work 2 hours per WEEK, what would you do? If you had to stop doing 80% of different time-consuming activities, what would you remove? What are the top 3 activities I use to fill time to feel as though I've been productive? If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day? There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Do them separately, from start to finish, without distraction. Do not multitask. You should have, at most, two primary goals per day. Do them from start to finish without distraction. THE LOW-INFORMATION DIET: I never watch the news, and have never bought a newspaper in 5 years. I check business email for 1 hour each Monday. I never check voicemail when abroad. What if someone has an emergency? It doesn't happen. My contacts now know I don't respond to emergencies, so the emergencies somehow don't exist or don't come to me. Problems, as a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower others. Increased output necessitates decreased input. Most information is time-consuming, negative, and irrelevant to your goals. ""Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?"" Ask for the phone numbers of 2 attractive women each day. Maintain eye contact. The real goal is not the numbers, but getting over the fear of asking, so the outcome is unimportant. ""Excuse me. I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don't ask you now, I'll be kicking myself for the rest of the day. I'm running to meet a friend, but I think you're really gorgeous. Could I have your phone number? I'm not a psycho - I promise. You can give me a fake one if you're not interested."" INTERRUPTING INTERRUPTION - THE ART OF THE REFUSAL Learn to be difficult when it counts. Having a reputation for being assertive will help you receive prefential treatment without having to beg or fight for it each time. An interruption is anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical task: - TIME WASTERS Limit access and funnel all communcation towards immediate action. Limit email consumption and production. Never check email first thing in the morning. Only once a day. Perhaps send autoresponder saying you're only checking email once a day & give your phone. Screen incoming and limit outgoing phone calls. Only use two numbers: one office or Skype for non-urgent, and one cell for urgent. Use cell in email autoresponse and always answer it. Office numbers goes directly to voicemail. When someone calls your cell, don't ask, ""How's it going?"" - just say, ""I'm right in the middle of something - how can I help?"" - if they say they can call back, say, ""No - I have a minute - what can I do for you?"" Get to the point immediately. If they start to wander, say you have only a couple minutes, and what can I do to help you out? Or perhaps ask them to send an email instead. Master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings. - TIME CONSUMERS When someone goes into too long of a story, say, ""I don't want the story. Just tell me what we need to do."" Keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether in person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. Make it clear that remaining on task is your policy. Train those around you to be effective and efficient. Respond to voicemail via email. This trains people to be concise. Write emails that have the if-then in them so they don't need a response. (Prepare for only answering email once a week.) When someone wants to talk on the phone, ask them to define the agenda: the topics and questions we'll need to address. If forced to have a meeting, define the end time. Do not leave these open-ended. - EMPOWERMENT FAILURES : WHERE SOMEONE NEEDS APPROVAL TO MAKE SOMETHING SMALL HAPPEN. For the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary information and as much independent decision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal is to grant as much information and independent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible. Tell employees : ""Keep the customer happy. If it's a problem that takes less than $100 to fix, use your judgement and fix it yourself. Fix these problems without contacting me. I am no longer your customer; my customers are your customer. Don't ask me for permission. Do what you think is right, and we'll make adjustments as we go along."" People are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove themselves. Act like a 2-year-old : say ""no"" to absolutely everything. Make it your default answer. Don't make up lies. OUTSOURCING: Getting a remote assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment you learn how to give orders and be commander instead of commanded. It's a litmus test for entrepreneurship : Can you manage other people? Using a VA as a simple exercise with no downside, the basics of management are covered in a 2-4 week test costing $100-$400. This is an investment not an expense. It's about building a system to replace yourself. Preparing someone to replace you will produce an ultrarefined set of rules that cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at all? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things. The most critical of skills : remote management and communication. It's not just about working smarter. It's about building a system to replace yourself. You can always do something cheaper yourself - that doesn't mean you want to spend your time doing it. Important to eliminate before you delegate: Never automate something that can be eliminated. Never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Don't waste anyone's time - not even someone you're paying for cheap. For example: instead of having an assistant read all your email, use automation & approach described above to just reduce it. I don't need an assistant to set meetings and conference calls because I've eliminated meetings. Refine rules and processes before adding people. Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined. The biggest challenge is the language barrier, which often quadruples back-and-forth discussion and the ultimate cost. I made the mistake of not setting an hour cap, and they spent 23 hours on a simple task: $230. Same task assigned to a native English speaker in Canada was completed in 2 hours for $25/hr. Later I requested another Indian VA from the same firm who was able to duplicate the native speaker's results. How do you know which to choose? You don't. It's a matter of testing a few assistants to sharpen your communication skills and determine who is worth hiring. Per-hour cost is not the ultimate determinant of cost. Look at per-task cost. Don't spend time restating the task and otherwise managing the VA. Use a VA firm instead of a solo operator, so you can switch, and have reduncancy. Not dependent on one person. Never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from subcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission. The more established and higher-end firms have security measures to pinpoint abusers in case of security breach. Never use debit cards for online transactions. If your VA will be accessing websites on your behalf, create a new unique login for them. Request someone who has ""excellent"" English, and say that phone calls will be required (even if not). Be precise: say what the outcome of the task is, so that they don't get the wrong idea & give a detailed report for unintended. Sentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. Even if for native-speaker. Ask foreign VAs to rephrase tasks to confirm understanding before getting started. Request a status update after a few hours of work, to ensure the task is both understood and achievable. Assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I've had best luck with 24-48 hours. Assign order of importance or even better : assign just one or two tasks at a time. http://www.b2kcorp.com/ = BrickWork = business only. $15/hr. http://www.getfriday.com/ = $6.25/hr, English capability varies wildly. Business and personal. Interview yours before starting. Online business manager = higher-level VA = helps 6-figure-income clients achieve 7-figures with business model redesigns. Look at your to-do list : what's been on it the longest. Each time you're interrupted or change tasks, ask, ""Could a VA do this?"" Examine pain points : what causes you the most frustration and boredom? Don't expect too much, but don't expect too little, either. Identify your top 5 time-consuming non-work tasks and 5 personal tasks you could assign for sheer fun. Don't lose sight of dreams and fall into work for work's sake. Don't handle problems your outsourcers or co-workers can handle. Don't help outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more than once, or with noncrisis problems. Give them if-then rules for solving all but the largest problems. Give them freedom to act without your input. Set the limits in writing, then emphasize in writing that you will not respond to help with problems that are covered by these rules. At the end of each month or quarter, review how their decisions have affected profit and adjust the rules accordingly. Don't chase customers, particularly unqualified or international prospects, when you have sufficient cash flow to finance your nonfinancial pursuits. Don't answer email that will not result in a sale, or that can be answered by an FAQ or auto-responder. Don't work where you live, sleep, or should relax. Separate your environments. Perform a thorough 80/20 analysis every 2-4 weeks for your business and personal life. Don't strive for endless perfection rather than great or good-enough, whether in personal or professional life. Don't blow minutea and small problems out of proportion as an excuse to work. Don't make non-time-sensitive issues urgent in orde to justify work. Don't view one project, job, or project as the end-all and be-all of your existence. Don't ignore the social rewards of life. Surround yourself with happy positive people who have nothing to do with work. Create your muses alone if you must, but don't live your life alone. The remote-control CEO : The intentional absence has enabled him to create a process-driven instead of founder-driven business. Limiting contact with managers forces the entrepreneur to develop operational rules that enable others to deal with problems themselves instead of calling for help. I am not a tollbooth through which anything needs to pass. I am more like a police officer on the side of the road, who can step in if need be, and I use detailed reports from outsourcers to ensure the cogs are moving as intended. I check bank accounts online twice a month to look for odd deductions. Contract outsourcing companies that specialize in one function (versus freelancers) whenever possible so that if someone is fired, quits, or doesn't perform, you can replace them without interrupting your business. Hire trained groups of people who can provide detailed reporting and replace one another as needed. Ensure that all outsourcers are willing to communicate among themselves to solve problems, and give them written permission to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you first. Being bound to one place will be the new defining feature of middle class. You want unrestricted mobility. The new mantra (even for your employees) is this : work wherever and whenever you want, but get your work done. Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot : record all income and all expenses. What can you eliminate that is either seldom used or that creates stress or distraction without adding a lot of value? What is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time? (Eliminate the other 80% in clothing, magazines, books, all else.) Which belongings create stress in my life? (Maintenance costs, insurance, monthly expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction.) hostels.com - hotelchatter.com - myworldphone.com - worldelectronicsusa.com - franzus.com - kropla.com - cfares.com BIG RULE (ABOUT LIFE) : if you can't define it, or act upon it, forget it.

D: work for yourself NR: have others work for you D: work when you want to: NR: do the minimum necessary D: be boss instead of employee - be in charge NR: neither boss nor employee, but the owner. D: to reach the big pay-off, record deal, pot of gold NR: ensure payday comes every day. cashflow first, big payday second. Relative income : that two people making $100k each, one spends 50 hours a week, one spends 10. The one spending 10 is ahead. Count $/hour not $ total. DOING THE UNREALISTIC is easier than doing the realistic. If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable [hurdles]. Realistic goals are uninspiring. Doing big things begins with asking for them properly. : ""What would excite me?"" The opposite of happiness is boredom. Excitement is the more practical synonymn for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. What if there was no way you could fail? What if you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world? Convert being into doing. Great cook? -> Christmas dinner without help. Fluent in Chinese? -> 5-minute conversation with Chinese co-worker. EFFECTIVE vs EFFICIENT Perform a task in the most economical matter possible. Door-to-door salesman is efficient, but ineffective. (Would do better with email.) Same for person who checks email 30 times a day and has GTD methods.","Brilliant reversal of all of the “how to manage all your crap” books. This one tells you how to say “no” to the crap, set expectations on your terms, and be just as effective in a fraction of the time.

The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read,Daniel R. Solin,0399532838,9,"DEFINTIONS: ""Smart"" Investing = investing for market returns by investing in all the stocks and bonds in broad market indexes. ""Hyperactive"" Investing = trying to beat the market by picking winners and timing the market. (aka ""Dumb"") Investing for market returns is easier than investing hyperactively because: - you don't have to pay any attention to the financial media - you don't have to sift through mountains of conflicting information from self-styled experts - it's less expensive - the results are demonstrably superior - most investors do not need any advisor or broker : you can deal directly with brand-name mutual fund families - it should only take you 90 minutes or so per year There is ample data indicating that, over the long term, simply achieving market returns will beat 95% of all professionally managed investment portfolios. A majority of the volume of trading in the U.S. are just index (""smart"") investing. FOUR VANGUARD MODEL PORTFOLIOS: (1970-2004) Worst Single Calendar Year Loss, Average Annual Return LOW RISK = 3% loss, 8% gain MEDIUM-LOW RISK = 7% loss, 9% gain MEDIUM-HIGH RISK = 13% loss, 10% gain HIGH RISK = 18% loss, 11% gain Hold investments in a group of funds that, in turn, have investments in all the securities (stocks or bonds) in a particular index - that represent three broad indexes. #1 = An index fund representative of the US stock market in its broadest terms. (Fidelity: FSTMX, Vanguard: VTSMX, Schwab: SWTSX) #2 = An index fund representative of the international stock market in its broadest terms. (Fidelity FSIIX, Vanguard: VGTSX, Schwab: SWISX) #3 = An index fund representative of the US bond market in its broadest terms. (Fidelity: FBIDX, Vanguard: VBMFX, Schwab: SWLBX) ASSET ALLOCATION: LOW RISK = 14% stocks, 6% int'l stocks, 80% bonds MEDIUM-LOW RISK = 28% stocks, 12% int'l stocks, 60% bonds MEDIUM-HIGH RISK = 42% stocks, 18% int'l stocks, 40% bonds HIGH RISK = 56% stocks, 24% int'l stocks, 20% bonds (NOTE: all stock-holdings are 70% domestic, 30% international. Only choice is how much are stocks and how much are bonds.) Asset allocation accounts for 90% or more of the expected return from any particular portfolio. The specific securities held only account for 5%. Market timing accounts for 2%. Your cash requirements should amount to 6-12 months of living expenses. http://www.smartestinvestmentbook.com/ has interactive asset-allocation wizard. ############## THE FOUR-STEP PROCESS ################# 1. Decide on your asset allocation (low, medium-low, medium-high, or high) 2. Open an account with Fidelity, Vanguard, or similar passive deep-discount index 3. Invest as described in your asset allocation plan 4. Rebalance your portfolio twice a year to keep your portfolio either aligned with your original asset allocation or to a new asset allocation that meets your changed investment objectives or risk tolerance. ############################### CHOOSING ACCOUNT (if not Fidelity): Very few fund families have a single stock market index fund that spans the entire U.S. stock market. Many fund families have an S&P 500, but that doesn't include the necessary small stocks. So you could find one that has both S&P 500 and a small stock index fund. If so, do 60% of stocks in S&P 500, 10% in small stock index fund, 30% in international. New and increasingly popular option is ETF, Exchange-Traded Fund, designed to replicate returns of a particular index. Because they trade on exchange, they can be traded at any time. Fees are very low, which makes them a reasonable alternative to index funds. But they incur commissions like stocks, each time you trade. As a practical matter, it doesn't make a difference whether you use ETFs or index mutual funds. If doing ETF, easiest way is to do ""iShares"" from barclays.com. 70% of stocks in iShares Russell 3000 Index (IWV), 30% of stocks in iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), 100% of bonds in iShares Lehman Aggregate (AGG) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FINANCIAL PORNOGRAPHY: In November 2000, Fortune magazine released the ""top picks"" from its panelists of ""top"" stock analysts. Between November 2000 and November 2003, here's how those predictions fared: S&P 500 = -22% NASDAQ = -41% Fortune Picks = -80% In August 1979, Business Week featured a story called ""The Death of Equities"", saying it's a near-permanent position. Almost immediately after publication, stocks began one of the great bull markets in history. Smart investors pay no attention to the predictions made in the financial media, and never use them as a basis for their investment decisions. ---------=========--------- WHEN DO SMART INVESTORS NEED AN ADVISOR? For larger investors with over $1M, some investment advisors can add value by adding a layer of complexity and fine-tuning to the asset allocation strategies named here. Fine-tuning for market returns usually adds some measure of extra benefit, without taking on extra risk, but it comes at a price : the management fee charged by an investment advisor. Some add real value by putting together relatively complex portfolios that seek a premium over market returns by using a fund family called Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) http://www.dfaus.com (NOTE: Dan Solin, the author, is a registered advisor and uses DFA funds for his clients.) DFA manages more than $100 billion for large institutional and individual investors. It does not engage in market timing or stock picking. All of its funds are passively managed, using a variant of index funds. DFA makes its funds available through selected fee-based advisors, listed on their site. Be wary of any advisor who does not consider the lowest-cost options to implementing investment portfolios, including Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Fidelity/Vanguard index funds, low-cost index funds, or the entire lineup of passively managed DFA mutual funds. DFA and its network of consultants offer passive portfolios that are slightly different than ETFs and typical Fidelity index funds. These differences are due to the way in which stocks are assigned to indexes, by their real size (for example) without waiting for market index reconstitution. DFA also offers funds that concentrate on more precisely defined sectors, like more flavors of ice cream. (Versus Fidelity's vanilla, chocolate, strawberry.) For example : Fidelity doesn't offer index funds in the international small-cap or international value markets. There is strong academic evidence that tilting a portfolio optimially toward value and small-cap equities will, over long holding periods, outperform the broader equity markets by as much as 1-2% per year. But I do not believe this is worth it for investors with less than $1M to invest, when you consider the cost of advisors' fees. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #1 greatest threat to your financial well-being is the hyperactive broker or advisor. #2 greatest threat to your financial well-being is the false belief that you can trade on your own and attempt to beat the markets by engaging in stock picking or market timing. It is reasonable to expect your portfolio to achieve annualized returns from 7-11% over the long term. Attempting to achieve returns higher than 11% involves speculating. If you choose one of the portfolios described here, you are likely to beat the returns of 95% of actively managed mutual funds over the long term.","An itty-bitty quick-read no-fluff book with the wisest succinct advice to investors: You can't predict the future, and neither can anyone else. Determine your asset allocation, stick with cheap broad indexes, and rebalance occasionally."
The Wisdom of Crowds,James Surowiecki,0385721706,9,"Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and are often smarter than the smartest people in them. Groups do not need to be dominated by exceptionally intelligent people in order to be smart. Even if most of the people within a group are not especially well-informed or rational, it can still reach a collectively wise decision. When our imperfect judgements are aggregated in the right way, our collective intelligence is often excellent. We assume that the key to solving problems or making good decisions is finding that one right person who will have the answer. The argument of this book is that chasing the expert is a mistake, and a costly one at that. We should stop hunting and ask the crowd instead. Chances are, it knows. (Crowd includes the geniuses as well as everyone else.) The best way for a group to be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as possible. ** Chapter 1 In general, the bigger the crowd the better. If you run 10 different jelly-bean-counting experiments, it's likely that each time one or two students will outperform the group. But they will not be the same students each time. Over 10 experiments, the group's performance will almost certainly be the best possible. The simplest way to get reliably good answers is just to ask the group each time. The 4 conditions that characterize wise crowds: 1. Diversity of opinion 2. Independence 3. Decentralization 4. Aggregation If you ask 100 people to run a 100-meter race, the average time will not be better than the time of the fastest runners. It will be worse - a mediocre time. But ask 100 people to answer a question or solve a problem, and the average number will often be as least as good as the answer of the smartest member. With most things, the average is mediocrity. With decision making, it's often excellence. ** Chapter 2 (About product innovation or small companies:) What makes a system successful is its ability to generate lots of losers and then to recognize them as such and kill them off. Sometimes the messiest approach is the wisest. Generating a diverse set of possible solutions isn't enough. The crowd also has to be able to distinguish the good solutions from the bad. The simple fact of making a group diverse makes it better at problem solving. Grouping only smart people together doesn't work that well, because the smart people tend to resemble each other in what they can do. The group knows less than it otherwise might. Adding in a few people who know less, but have different skills, actually improves the group's performance. Groups that are too much alike find it harder to keep learning, because each member is bringing less and less to the table. They spend too much time exploiting, and not enough time exploring. The fact that cognitive diversity matters does not mean that if you assemble a group of diverse but thoroughly uninformed people, their collective wisdom wil be smarter than an expert's. But if you can assemble a diverse group of people who possess varying degrees of knowledge and insight, you're better off entrusting it with major decisions rather than leaving them in the hands of one or two people, no matter how smart those people are. A large group of diverse individuals will come up with better and more robust forecasts and make more intelligent decisions than even the most skilled ""decision maker"". Seer-sucker theory : No matter how much evidence exists that seers do not exist, suckers will pay for the existence of seers. If a group is so unintelligent that it will flounder without the right expert, it's not clear why the group would be intelligent enough to recognize an expert when it found him. [When one person realizes they are clearly a non-conformer in a group of conformers, they tend to conform. But...] having even one other person in the group who felt as they did made the subjects happy to announce their thoughts and the rate of conformity plummeted. ** Chapter 3 The smartest groups are made up of people with diverse perspectives who are able to stay independent of each other. You can be biased and irrational, but as long as you're independent, you won't make the group any dumber. The more influence a group's members exert on each other, and the more personal contact they have with each other, the less likely it is that the group's decisions will be wise ones. We could become individually smarter but collectively dumber. ""Social proof"" : the tendency to assume that if lots of people are doing something or believe something, there must be a good reason why. That's why the crowd becomes more influential as it becomes bigger : every additional person is proof that something important is happening. Following the group is a reasonable strategy, but if too many people adopt that strategy, it stops being sensible and the group stops being smart. (Fads/Crazes:) Everyone thinks that people are making decisions based on what they know, when in fact people are making decisions based on what they think the people who came before them knew. Instead of aggregating all the information individuals have, the cascade becomes a sequence of uninformed choices, so that collectively the group ends up making a bad decision. People are, in general, overconfident. They overestimate their ability, level of knowledge, and decision-making prowess. More overconfident when facing big problems than easy ones. The more important a decison, the less likely a cascade (fad/craze) is to take hold. The more important the decision, the more likely it is that the groups' collective verdict will be right. Encouraging people to make incorrect guesses actually made the group as a whole smarter. One key to successful group decisions is getting people to pay much less attention to what everyone else is saying. ** Chapter 4 Decentralization : power does not fully reside in one central location, and many of the important decisions are made by individuals based on their own local and specific knowledge rather than by an omniscient or farseeing planner. It fosters and is fed by specialization. The closer a person is to a problem, the more likely he or she is to have a good solution to it. Decentralization's great weakness is that there's no guarantee that valuable information which is uncovered in one part of the system will find its way through the rest of the system. Sometimes valuable information never gets disseminated. A decentralized system can only produce genuinely intelligent results if there's a means of aggregating the information of everyone in the system. ** Chapter 5 Convention explains why: - companies rarely cut wages in a recession (it violates workers' expectations and hurts moral), preferring instead to lay people off - every major car company releases its new models in September, (even though there would be less competition if each company released its cars in different months) - clothing retailers apply a simple 50% markup, then discount like mad if the items don't sell - it costs you as much to see a ""total limping dog"" movie in its last week of release as it does a hugely popular film on opening night About organization and coordination: Next time you go to the supermarket looking for orange juice, it'll be there waiting, even though you didn't tell the grocer you were coming. There will be as much orange juice in the freezer as the store's customers want over the next few days, even though none of them told the grocer they were coming. The juice you buy will have been packaged days earlier, after it was made from oranges picked weeks earlier, by people who don't even know you exist. The players in that chain - shopper, grocer, wholesaler, packager, grower - are not acting on formal rules, but they are using local knowledge and making decisions not on the basis of what's good for everyone, but rather on the basis of what's good for themselves. And yet, without anyone leading them or directing them, people are able to coordinate their economic activities. In the 50 years since Vernon Smith did his first experiment in [wisdom of crowds] and published the results, they have been replicated thousands of times in ever more complex variations. But the essential conclusion of those early tests has not been challenged : that, under the right conditions, imperfect humans can produce near-perfect results. ** Chapter 6 To solve cooperation problems - like keeping the sidewalk free of snow, paying taxes, and curbing pollution - the members of a society need to do more. They need to adopt a broader definition of self-interest than the myopic one that maximizing profits in the short-term demands. And they need to trust those around them, because in the absense of trust the pursuit of myopic self-interest is the only strategy that makes sense. ""Ultimatum game"" : behavioral economics : 2 people given $10 to divide between them. One person decides what the split should be, then makes take-it-or-leave-it offer to the other person. That person can either accept the offer, in which case both players pocket their respective shares of the cash, or reject it, in which case both players walk away empty-handed. If both players are purely rational, the proposer will keep $9 and offer $1, and the responder will take it, since if he accepts he gets $1, and rejects gets none. In practice, though, this rarely happens. Instead, lowball offers, anything below $2, are routinely rejected. Think about what this means : people would rather have nothing than let the other person walk away with too much of the loot. They will give up free money to punish what they perceive as greedy or selfish behavior. People think, in an ideal world, everyone would end up with the amount of money they deserved. An an interesting version of the Ultimatum game, instead of assigning the proposer role randomly, the researchers made it seem as if the proposers had earned their positions by doing better on a test. In those experiments, the proposers offered significantly less money, yet not a single offer was rejected. People apparently thought that a proposer who merited his position deserved to keep more of the wealth. In America, the people whom inequality bothers most are the rich. Americans are far more likely to believe that wealth is the result of initiative and skill, while Europeans are more likely to attribute it to luck. The foundation of cooperation is not really trust, but the durability of the relationship. Whether the players trust each other or not is less important in the long run than whether the conditions are ripe for them to build a stable pattern of cooperation with each other. Successful cooperation requires that people start off by being nice, willing to cooperate, but have to be willing to punish noncooperative behavior as soon as it appears. The best approach is to be ""nice, forgiving, and retailiatory"". We have learned that trade and exchange are games in which everyone can end up gaining. The benefits of being trusting and of being trustworthy are potentially immense, because a successful market system teaches people to recognize those benefits. Merchant guilds - most notably the German Hanseatic League - protected their members against the unfair treatment from city-states by imposing collective trade embargoes against cities that seized merchant property. Previously, trust had been the product primarily of a personal or in-group relationship. Modern capitalism made the idea of trusting people with whom you had no personal ties seem reasonable, if only by demonstrating that strangers would not, as a matter of course, betray you. Buying and selling no longer required a personal connection. It's driven instead by the benefits of mutual exchange. I can walk into a store somewhere far from home and buy an item that was made across the world, and it will probably work well. This is true even though I may never walk in that store again. We take the reliability of the store and manufacturer for granted. But in fact, they're remarkable achievements. Capitalism is healthiest when people believe the long-term benefits of fair dealing outweigh the short-term benefits of sharp dealing. Collective action like political rallys : for the individual it would make more sense to let someone else do the work. Everyone has an incentive to sit on their hands, wait for someone else to do something, and free ride. Since everyone wants to be a free-rider, nothing gets done. ((But since people do get involved, like paying taxes for example, it shows that other emotions are at work.)) ** Part 2 : EXAMPLES (Scientists:) The quest for recognition ensures a steady infusion of diverse thought, since no one becomes famous for restating what's already known. If you talk a lot in a group, people will tend to think of you as influential almost by default. Talkative people are not necessarily well liked, but they are listened to. Group decisions are not inherently inefficient. This suggests that deliberation can be valuable when done well, even if after a certain point its marginal benefits are outweighed by the costs. There is no point in making small groups part of a leadership structure if you do not give the group a method of aggregating the opinions of its members. If small groups are included in the decision-making process, then they should be allowed to make decisions. If an organization sets up teams and then uses them for purely advisory purposes, it loses the true advantage that a team has : namely, collective wisdom. ** Chapter 10 : The Company You do not need consensus in order to tap into the wisdom of a crowd. The search for consensus encourages tepid lowest-common-denominator solutions which offend no one rather than exciting everyone. Even those companies that tried to make the decision-making process more democratic thought democracy meant endless discussion rather than a wider distribution of decision-making power. Attempting to run an entire company by command and control is a futile task. It's too costly in terms of time and requires far too much information that top executives should not be bothering with. What gets in the way of the exchange of real information is a deep-rooted hostility on the part of the bosses to opposition from subordinates. This is the real cost of top-down approach to decision making : it confers the illusion of perfectibility upon the decision makers and encourages everyone else simply to play along. Companies tend to pay people based on whether they do what they're expected to do. In a market, people get paid simply on what they do! Ideally, the same would be true inside a company. This is an essential part of what markets do : encourage people to find new valuable information and then let everyone else know about it. This too is what corporations should be looking for : ways to provide their employees with the incentive to uncover and act on private information. Even small option grants seem to instill a sense of ownership, and we know that owners are, in general, more likely to take good care of their property than renters are. Far more important than stock options would be the elimination of rigid managerial hierarchies and the wider distribution of real decision-making power. The more responsibilty people have for their own environments the more engaged they will be. Allowing people to make decisions about their own working conditions makes a material difference in how they perform. Decentralized markets work exceptionally well because the people and companies in those markets are getting constant feedback from customers. Companies that aren't doing a good job or are spending too much learn to adjust or else they go out of business. Some academics suggest that CEOs have, at best, a minor impact on corporate performance. The more power you give a single individual in the face of complexity and uncertainty, the more likely it is that bad decisions will get made. Use methods of aggregating collective wisdom. The anonymity of the markets and the fact that they yield a relatively clear solution, while giving individuals an unmistakable incentive to uncover and act on good information, means that their potential value is genuinely hard to overestimate. The more important the decision, the more important it is that it not be left in the hands of a single person. ** Chapter 11 : Stock Market The measure of the stock market's success is not whether stock prices are rising. It's whether stock prices are right. It's harder for the market to get prices right when there is so little money on the short side. The psychology of investors: - sometimes herd, preferring the safety of the company of others to make independent decisions. - too much credence to recent and high-profile news while underestimating the longer-lasting trends or less dramatic events - (in the same way people worry about being killed in a plane crash while not paying attention to their high cholesterol) - fooled by randomness, believing money managers who have had a few good quarters have figured out the trick of beating the market - find losses twice as painful as they find gains pleasurable, so hold on to stocks longer than they should, believing as long as they haven't sold it, they haven't suffered any losses - above all, overconfident, which means they trade more than they should and end up costing themselves money as a result - (from 1991-1996 the market returned 17.9%. active investors earned just 11.4%. They would have done better had they just sat on their hands.) Individual irrationality can add up to collective rationality. People want to save, and do not need a massive push to do so. What they do need is a way to make saving easier and spending harder. One way of doing this is to make enrollment in retirement plans automatic, rather than asking people to sign up for them. If people have to take action to opt out of a retirement plan rather than having to take action to opt in, they are significantly more likely to stay in the plan and more likely to save. Inertia is a powerful tool. The idea of the wisdom of crowds is not that a group will always give you the right answer, but that on average it will consistently come up with a better answer than any individual could provide. That's why the fact that only a fraction of investors consistently do better than the market remains the most powerful piece of evidence that the market is efficient. The healthiest markets are those that are animated by both fear and greed at the same time. Any time you sell a stock, the person who's buying it thinks differently about the future prospects of that stock. You think it's going down, he thinks it's going up. One of you will be right, but the important thing is that it's only through the interaction of those differing attitudes that the market is able to do a good job of allocating capital. In a bubble, all of the conditions that make groups intelligent - independence, diversity, private judgement - disappear. The price of TVs doesn't suddenly double overnight only to crash a few months later. You never end up with a situation where the fact that prices are rising makes people more interested in buying (which is what happens in a bubble). The more expensive a TV gets, the less interested people are in buying it. (bubbles:) The kind of diversity of opinion that a healthy market depends on was replaced by a sort of single-mindedness. Everyone was convinced the greater fool was out there. If groups on the whole are relatively intelligent (as we know they are), there's a good chance that a stock price is actually right. Problem is that once everyone starts piggybacking on the wisdom of the group, then no one is doing anything to add to the wisdom of the group. News reporters tend to overplay the importance of any particular piece of information. The best way to disclose public information is without hype or commentary from people in the positions of power. (Like the way the Federal Reserve announces its interest-rate hikes.) A mob in the middle of a riot appears to be a single organism, acting with one mind. ** Chapter 12 : Government Government kept getting bigger, since everyone had an individual interest in getting a little more from the state, and no one was looking out for the collective interest, entered into cozy arrangements with the businesses it was regulating, and that allowed economic policy to be run in the interests of powerful groups instead of the interests of the public as a whole. Though everyone may say they are into the common good, to different individuals and groups, the common good is bound to mean different things. ** AFTERWORD: One of the key lessons of the Wisdom of Crowds is that we don't always know where good information is. That's why, in general, it's smarter to cast as wide a net as possible, rather than wasting time figuring out who should be in the group and who should not. This idea is well suited to the internet. The more information a group has, the better its collective judgement will be, so you want as many people with good information in a group as possible. The Wisdom of Crowds is not an argument against experts, but against our excessive faith in the single individual decision maker. If a group is smart enough to know whether an individual is a genuine decision-making prodigy, then the group is smart enough to not need that individual. Even brilliant experts have biases and blind spots, so they can make mistakes. What's troubling is that, in general, they don't know when they're making those mistakes. Experts don't know when they don't know something. That's why it's worthwhile to cast a wider net and why relying on a crowd of decision makers improves (though doesn't guarantee) your chances of reaching a good decision. Be careful to keep the group diverse, and careful to prevent people from influencing one another too much. The crowd's judgement is going to give us the best chance of making the right decision, and in the face of that knowledge, traditional notions of power and leadership should begin to pale. I am cautiously hopeful that they will, allowing us to begin to trust individual leaders less and ourselves more. ----------- Wisdom of crowds works on problems where there's a true answer, or when some choices are better than other in some Platonic sense. The reason this works is that people are operating on private info, which may be bad or fragmented. The opinions are diverse -- not consensus but disagreements. People don't know much about what others are betting on or guessing -- not a lot of interpersonal interaction. ------------ RELATED BOOKS: Smart Mobs by Howard Rheingold The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) TradeSports.com NewsFutures.com","Mind-blowing examples of how groups of diverse people acting independently are smarter than any one person in the group.

The Paradox of Choice - Why More is Less,Barry Schwartz,0060005688,9,"With limitless choice, we produce better results with our decisions than we would in a more limited world, but we feel worse about them. When people have no choice, life is almost unbearable. As the number of choices increase, the autonomy, control, and liberation this variety brings are powerful and positive. But as the number of choices keeps growing, negative aspects of having a multitude of options begin to appear. As the number of choices grows further, the negatives escalate until we become overloaded. At this point, choice no longer liberates, but debilitates. There is no denying that choice improves the quality of our lives. It enables us to control our destinies and to come close to getting exactly what we want out of any situation. The fact that some choice is good doesn't mean that more choice is better. I will argue that... 1. We would be better off if we embraced certain voluntary constraints on our freedom of choice, instead of rebelling against them. 2. We would be better off seeking what is ""good enough"" instead of seeking the best. 3. We would be better off if we lowered our expectations about the results of decisions. 4. We would be better off if the decisions we made were non-reversible. 5. We would be better off if we paid less attention to what others around us were doing. When given free samples of jams in a store, 30% of people exposed to 6 jams bought a jar. Only 3% of people exposed to 24 jams bought a jar. A large array of options discourages customers because it forces an increase in the effort that goes into making a decision. So consumers decide not to decide. Thinking about the attractions of some of the unchosen options detracts from the pleasure derived from the chosen one. When experiencing dissatisfaction on a shopping trip, consumers are likely to blame it on something else (salespeople, traffic, prices) - anything but the overwhelming array of options. Could readers be attracted to a magazine that offered to simplify their lives by convincing them to stop wanting many of the things they wanted? A majority of people want more control over the details of their lives, but a majority of people also want to simplify their lives. Most people feel they lack the expertise to make decisions about their money by themselves. Patients prefer to have others make their decisions for them. 65% surveyed said if they were to get cancer, they'd want to choose their own treatment. But only 12% of people with cancer want to do so. We always think we want choice, but when we actually get it, we may not like it. The burden of having every activity be a matter of deliberate and conscious choice would be too much for any of us to bear. Most good decisions involve these steps: 1. Figure out your goals 2. Evaluate the importance of each goal 3. Array the options 4. Evaluate how likely each of the options is to meet your goals 5. Pick the winning option 6. Later, use the consequences of your choice to modify your goals, the importance you assign them, and the way you evaluate future possibilities. As the number of options increases, the effort required to make a good decision escalates as well. The process of goal-setting and decision-making begins with the question ""What do I want?"" Looks easy to answer, and addressed largely through internal dialogue. But knowing what we want means being able to anticipate accurately how one choice or another will make us feel, and that is no simple task. Interesting story about how you can read Consumer Reports saying that Volvo is the most reliable car (based on dozens or hundreds of sources, combined). But all it takes is one person at a party saying, ""Oh I had one and it was nothing but trouble"" to sway us from our choice. Logically, this one report should have almost no influence on your decision. Unfortunately most people give substantial weight to this kind of antecdotal ""evidence"", perhaps so much that it will cancel out the positive recommendation from Consumer Reports, because it is extremely vivid and based on a personal, detailed, face-to-face account. We assume that the more available some piece of information is to memory, the more frequently we must have encountered it in the past. When you see film footage of a $50,000 car being driven into a wall, it's hard to believe the car company doesn't care about safety, no matter what the crash-test statistics say. People mistook the pervasiveness of newspaper stories about murders, accidents, or fires as a sign of the frequency of the events these stories profiled. This distortion causes us to miscalculate the various risks we face in life, and thus contributes to some very bad choices. Any random group of people predicting who will win the Academy Awards will do better than the predictions of any one individual. (!!) The group picked 11 out of 12 winners correctly, while the average individual only picked 5 out of 12 correctly, and even the best individual only picked 9. This is amplified by mass-reach news, because friends and neighbors will have the same biased story from the same source, making us assume it to be true. The more people believe it's true, the more likely you are to repeat it, and more likely you are to hear it. This is how inaccurate information can create a bandwagon effect, leading quickly to a broad but mistaken consensus. Any particular item will always be at the mercy of the context in which it is found. A store sold a bread-maker for $279. Later, they added a deluxe version for $429. They didn't sell many of the expensive ones, but sales of the less expensive one doubled! The $279 now looked like a bargain. Even if companies sell almost none of the highest-priced models, they can reap enormous benefits from producing such models because they help induce people to buy their cheaper (but still expensive) ones. Losses have more than twice the psychological impact as equivalent gains. Loss aversion. Once something is given to you, it's yours. Giving it up will entail a loss. Because losses are more bad than gains are good, the thing you have gained is worth more to you than it is to a potential trading partner. Losing the thing will hurt worse than gaining the thing will give pleasure. This is why companies can afford to offer money-back guarantees. Once people own them, the products are worth more to their owners than the mere cash value, because giving up the products would entail a loss. Even with relatively unimportant decisions, mistakes can take a toll. When you put a lot of time or effort into choosing a restaurant, vacation place, item of clothing, you want that effort to be rewarded with a satisfying result. As options increase, the effort involved in making decisions increases, so mistakes hurt even more. Thus: - decisions require more effort - mistakes are more likely - the psychological consequences of mistakes are more severe If you seek and accept only the best, you are a maximizer. If you settle for something ""good enough"", and don't worry about the possibility that there might be something better, you are a sufficer. To a maximizer, satisficers appear to be willing to settle for mediocre, but a satisficer may be just as discriminating. The difference is that the satisficer is content with the merely excellent as opposed to the absolute best. The goal of maximizing is a source of great dissatisfaction. Satisficing is, in fact, the maximizing strategy. The best thing people can do is to satisfice. - Maximizers savor positive events less than satisficers and do not cope as well with negative events. - After something bad happens to them, maximizers' sense of well-being takes longer to recover. - Maximizers tend to brood or ruminate more than sacrificers. Whereas maximizers might do better objectively than satisficers, they send to do worse subjectively. So - what counts when we asses the quality of a decision? Objective results or subjective experience? What matters most of the time is how we feel about the decisions we make. Students who think they're in the right school get far more out of it than the students who don't. Figure out when information-seeking has reached the point of diminishing returns, stop the search, and choose the best option. Perfectionists have very high standards that they don't expect to meet, whereas maximizers do. Perfectionists are happier with the results of their actions than maximizers. For someone who feels overwhelmed by choices, apply the satisficing strategy more often, letting go of the expectation that ""the best"" is attainable. Adding options doesn't add much work for the satisficer, because the satisficer feels no compulsion to check out all the possibilities before deciding. Learned helplessness can affect future motivation to try, and future ability to detect that you do have control in new situations. Our most fundamental sense of well-being crucially depends on our having the ability to exert control over our environment and recognizing that we do. Feelings of helplessness should now be rare. But in 1966, only 9% felt left out of things going on around them, in 1986, 37%. In 1966, 36% said what they thought didn't matter, whereas in 1986, 60% agreed. The most important factor in providing happiness is close social relations. Happy people attract others to them, and being with others makes people happy. In many ways, social ties actually decrease freedom, choice, and autonomy. Establishing and maintaining social relations requires a willingness to be bound or constrained by them, even when dissatisfied. Once people make commitments to others, options close. Following rules eliminates troublesome choices in your daily life. Friendships often sustain themselves on a combination of standards and routines. We're drawn to people who meet our standards and then we stick with them. We don't make a choice, every day, about whether to maintain the friendship. We just do. Some cultures have constraints in oppresive abundance, while ours has eliminated as many constraints as possible. But oppression can exist at either extreme. Wanting and liking are served by fundamentally different brain systems. The downside of abundant choice is that each new option adds to the list of trade-offs. The quality of any given option can not be assessed in isolation from its alternatives. One of the costs of any option involves passing up the opportunities that a different option would have afforded. Excellent advice for managing our own psychological response to choice : Pay attention to what you're giving up in the next-best alternative, but don't waste energy feeling bad about having passed up an option further down the list that you wouldn't have gotten to anyway. The existence of multiple alternatives makes it easy for us to imagine alternatives that don't exist. When we engage our imaginations in this way, we will be even less satisfied with the alternative we end up choosing. There is no objective ""best"" vacation, job, or activity. What matters is the subjective experience. Being forced to confront trade-offs in making decisions makes people unhappy and indecisive. Story of retail situation: :: One Sony CD player for $99, far below list price 66% of people said they'd buy it. 34% would wait. :: Two CD players: Sony for $99 and $169 top-of-the-line Aiwa, both below list price 27% would buy the Sony, 27% would buy the Aiwa, 46% would wait. :: Sony CD player at $99 and a clearly inferior Aiwa at $105 73% go with the Sony, almost nobody goes for the Aiwa So... Faced with one attractive option, 66% of people will go for it. But add one conflicting option, and only 50% buy anything. Adding the 2nd option creates a conflict, forcing a trade-off between price and quality. The 2nd option made it harder, not easier, to choose. But in the 3rd scenario, the crappy Aiwa gave people confidence that the Sony is a good deal - an anchor of comparison that bolsters a buyer's reasons for buying the Sony. Call this a non-conflicting option? Difficult trade-offs make it difficult to justify decisions, so decisions are deferred. Easy trade-offs make it easy to justify decisions. Single options like somewhere in the middle. Doctors : man suffering from disease. Doctors asked whether they'd give him medication or send him to a specialist. 75% chose the medication. But when asked whether they'd give him a choice between two medications or send him to a specialist, only 50% chose any medication. Meaning: adding a 2nd medication doubled the likelihood they'd send him away to a specialist, in other words : defer the decision. When people are presented with options involving trade-offs that create conflict, all choices begin to look unappealing. Court being asked to decide which parent gets custody. Parent A = normal in every way. Parent B = extreme good-sides and extreme bad-sides. When asked which parent should get custody, most chose B. But when asked which parent should be denied custody, most chose B. Extreme (B) gave justifying reasons to choose, and also justifying reasons to deny. People put a higher value on things (when asked to guess a value) when evaluating in isolation than when evaluating as a part of a group. We want our doctors, investment advisors, Consumer Reports to be weighing the trade-offs for us. We don't want to have to evaluate the trade-offs ourselves. It's emotionally unpleasant. When we are in a good mood, we think better. We consider more possibilities. We're open to more considerations that would otherwise not occur to us. We see subtle connections we might otherwise miss. Something as trivial as a little gift of candy to medical residents improves the speed and accuracy of their diagnoses. Positive emotion enables us to broaden our understanding of what confronts us. Students given too many options of what to write an essay on : as they try to write about the topic they chose, they're further distracted by other appealing but rejected topics, preventing them from thinking clearly. When people are asked to give reasons for their preferences, they may struggle to find the words. So they grasp at what they can say, and identify it as the basis for their preference. As time passes, the reasons that people verbalized fade into the background and people are left with their unarticulated preferences. People's satisfaction with the decision they made, fades. There are pitfalls to deciding after analyzing : as the number of options goes up, the need to provide justifications for decisions also increases. While participants valued being able to reverse their choices, almost no one actually did so. Those who had the option to change their minds were less satisfied with their choices than participants who did not have that option. The more options you have, the more likely you will experience regret. When asked about what they regret most, people name failures to act. When you miss by a little, ouch. (Missing a plane by 1 minute causes much more regret than missing by an hour, since you obsess about all the things that could have saved you 1 minute.) Bronze medalists are happier than silver medalists, because instead of thinking how close they were to Gold, they think about how close they were to having no medal at all. ""Counterfactual"" = contrasting actual experience with what it could have been. ""Upward counterfactual"" = comparing to the next-best option (the Silver medalist) ""Downward counterfactual"" = comparing to next-worst option (the Bronze medalist) We'd be happier if we did Downward counterfactual more often. Be grateful things aren't worse. Upward comparisons produce jealousy, hostility, frustration, lowered self-esteem, and stress. Downward comparisons boost self-esteem, and reduce anxiety. Bad results make people equally unhappy whether they were responsible for it or not. But bad results make people regretful only if they were responsible. The more our experiences result from our own choices, the more regret we feel if things don't turn out as we hoped. People facing decisions involving trade-off, and thus opportunites for regret, will avoid making those decisions altogether. We show greater willingness to take risks when we know we will find out how the unchosen alternative turned out, and there is thus no way to protect ourselves from regret. People hold on to stocks that have decreased in value because selling them would turn the investment into a loss. If you buy two nonrefundable tickets to a ski trip, one costing $50, and one costing $25, then find out they're on the same day, you'll go on the $50 ski trip even if there's a good reason to think you'd have more fun on the $25 ski trip. Basketball coaches give more time to players earning higher salaries. People who have started their own business are more likely to invest in expanding them than people who have purchased their business. Many people persist in troubled relationships because of the effort they've already put in. In all of these cases, what should matter are the prospects for future performance, but what seems to matter is the previous investment. When there are many options, the chances increase that there is a really good one out there, and you feel you ought to be able to find it. When the option you actually settle on proves disappointing, you regret not having chosen more wisely. As the number of options continues to proliferate, concern for a better option may induce you to anticipate the regret you will feel later on, when that option is discovered, and thus prevent you from making any decision at all. Regret serves important functions : imagining the various scenarios that may follow it, help us see consequences, won't make the same mistakes, or even take the actions necessary to undo a decision. When we consume, we do experience pleasure, as long as the things we consume are novel. As novelty wears off, pleasure is replaced by comfort. If lottery ticker buyers knew in advance how little winning the lottery would improve their subjective well-being, they wouldn't be buying tickets. The more we invest in a decision, the more we expect to realize from our investment. Adaptation makes agonizing over decisions a bad investment. Adaptation will have more profound effects on maximizers than sufficers. Maximizers make such investment in their decisions so they're most disappointed when they discover the pleasure they derive from their decisions is short-lived. Different gaps: - gap between what one has and wants - gap between what one has and thinks others like oneself have - gap between what one has and the best one has had in the past - gap between what one has and what one expects Real hedonistic charge comes when an experience exceeds expectations. We can do more to affect the quality of our lives by controlling our expectations than we can by doing virtually anything else! Leave room for experiences to be a pleasant surprise. The challenge is keeping wonderful experiences rare. (No matter what you can afford, save great wine for special occasions.) It's a way to make sure you can continue to experience pleasure. More than half of people chose options that give them better relative position : better to earn $50k/yr while others around are earning $25k/yr than to be earning $100k/yr while others around are earning $200k/yr. Social comparison has relatively little impact on happy people. The tendency to ruminate traps unhappy people in a downward psychological spiral that is fed by social comparison. Optimists explain success with chronic, global and personal causes - and failures with transient specific. (""I got an A"", and ""She gave me a C"") Pessimists do the reverse. (""I got a C"" and ""She gave me an A"") In societies in which you have little control, you also have little expectation of control. Lack of control does not lead to feelings of helplessness and depression. Heightened individualism means causal explanations that encourage the individual to blame himself for failure. Unattainable expectations, plus a tendency to take intense personal responsibility for failure, make a lethal combination. Those nations whose citizens value personal freedom the most tend to have the highest suicide rates. These same values allow certain individuals within these cultures to thrive and prosper to an extraordinary degree. The problem is that on the national or ""ecological"" level, these same values have a pervasive, toxic effect. WHAT WE CAN DO: 1. Choose when to choose. Decide which choices in our lives really matter and focus our time and energy there, letting other opportunities pass us by. By restricting our options, we will be able to choose less and feel better. Try this: (1) review recent decisions you've made, (2) itemize the steps, time, research, and anxiety that went into it, (3) remind yourself how it felt to do that work, (4) ask yourself how much your final decision benefitted from that work. 2. Be a chooser not a picker Shorten or eliminate deliberations about decisions that are unimportant to you. If none of the options meet your needs, create better options that do. 3. Satisfice more and Maximize less 4. Limit how much you think about the attractive features of the options you reject. Unless you're truly dissatisfied, stick with what you always buy. Don't be tempted by ""new and improved"". Don't scratch unless there's an itch. Don't worry that if you do this, you'll miss out on all the new things the world has to offer. 5. Make your decisions nonreversible. Agonizing over whether your love is the real thing, or your sexual relationship up to par, wondering whether you could have done better - is a prescription for misery. Knowing you've made a choice that you will not reverse allows you to pour your energy into improving the relationship that you have rather than constantly second-guessing it. 6. Practice gratitude. 7. Regret less 8. Anticipate Adaptation (the fact that the ""fun wears off"" when you get used to the new choice) Remember that the high-quality sound system, the luxury car, the big house, won't keep providing the pleasure they give when we first experience them. Spend less time looking for the ""perfect"" thing, so that you won't have huge search costs to be amortized against the satisfaction you derive from what you actually choose. 9. Control Expectations Reduce the number of options you consider. Be a satisficer rather than maximizer. Allow for serendipity. 10. Curtail Social Comparison 11. Learn to Love Constraints By deciding to follow a rule, we avoid having to make a deliberate decision again and again.",Faced with many options or decisions in your life? This will change the way you look at them. We feel worse when we have too many options.
Made to Stick,Chip Heath and Dan Heath,1400064287,9,"For an idea to stick, for it to be useful and lasting, it's got to make the audience... 1. Pay attention (UNEXPECTED) 2. Understand and remember it (CONCRETE) 3. Agree / Believe (CREDIBLE) 4. Care (EMOTIONAL) 5. Be able to act on it. (STORY) ========== *** SIMPLE Good metaphors generate new perceptions, explanations, and inventions. Disney calls its employees ""cast members"". The metaphor as cast members in a theatrical production is communicated consistently throughout the organization: - Cast members don't interview for a job, they ""audition for a role"". - When they are walking around the park, they are ""onstage"". - People visiting Disney are ""guests"", not customers. - Jobs are ""performances"", uniforms are ""costumes"". This metaphor is very useful for Disney employees. Just by reading that description, above, you can predict how cast members should behave. (Example: can't be on break while in costume in public.) Street sweepers need to be trained in everything, since they are as visible as anyone. Subway, on the other hand, calls its employees ""sandwich artists"", but that doesn't help one bit. Doesn't make clear expectation. And is wrong, because ""artist"" is about individual expression, and employees can't get creative with sandwiches. If a message doesn't seem to translate into action, make it simpler and use concrete language. *** UNEXPECTED The most basic way to get someone's attention is to break a pattern. Consistent stimulation makes people tune out. We become aware of things only when something changes. (1) - identify the central message you need to communicate (2) - what's counterintuitive or unexpected about the message (3) - communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience's guessing machines. once broken, help them refine their machines. Common sense is the enemy of sticky messages! When they sound like common sense, they float in one ear & out the other. What sounds like common sense often isn't, so instead expose the parts of your message that are uncommon sense. Journalism 101: Teacher had students write headline. Gave them all these facts, ""Ken Peters, principal of Beverly Hills High School, announced that the entire faculty will travel to Sacramento next Thursday for a colloquium in new teaching methods. Among the speakers will be anthropologist Margaret Mead,... etc"" Most students rearranged those facts into a basic AP one-sentence headline. Finally the teacher said, ""The lead to the story is 'THERE WILL BE NO SCHOOL ON THURSDAY!'"" It's not about regurgitating the facts, but about figuring out the point. Understand why it matters. Point here being that students remembered that lesson for decades after because it was unexpected and simple. Create suspense! The ""AHA!"" moment is much more powerful if preceded by a ""HUH?"" moment of creating a mystery that you're about to solve. Create curiosity gaps : tell people just enough for them to realize the piece that's missing from their knowledge. Curiosity is the intellectual need to answer questions and close open patterns. Story plays to this by doing the opposite : by posing questions and opening situations. In a script, every scene should be a Turning Point : hook curiosity, what happens next?, how will it turn out? - the answer never arrives until the climax of the last act. It's important to OPEN gaps before we close them. Our tendency is to tell people the facts. First, though, they must realize that they need these facts. Highlight some specific knowledge that they're missing. Pose a question or puzzle that confronts people with a gap in their knowledge. Challenge them to predict an outcome, which creates two knowledge gaps : what will happen? and was I right? News does this : teases you with something that you didn't know, and didn't care about at all, until you found out that you didn't know it. Instead of thinking, ""What information do I need to convey?"", think, ""What questions do I want my audience to ask?"" *** CONCRETE What the world needs is a lot more fables! Aesop's ideas never would have lasted as ""Aesop's Helpful Suggestions"". (""Don't be bitter when you fail."") The Nature Conservancy: instead of talking in terms of land area, it talked about ""landscape"" with unique environmentally precious features. They avoided the trap of abstraction. Messages can not be allowed to grow ambiguous. ""World class customer service"" is abstract. ""Norstrom ironed their customer's shirt from another store"" is concrete. Concrete language helps people understand new concepts. Abstraction is the luxury of the expert. Novices crave concreteness, and cry out for an example. Memory is like velcro. Your brain hosts loops. The more hooks an idea has, the better it will cling to memory. The difference between an expert and a novice is the ability to think abstractly! It's easy to lose awareness that we're talking like an expert. *** CREDIBLE Telling stories using real people is the most compelling way. Delivery company, instead of saying, ""We are fast and dependable"" says, ""We handled the release of the Harry Potter book."" 'Nuff said! Best of all : let people try out an idea on themselves, instead of just reading about someone else trying it. (Especially when being fooled by something. Don't just say ""people were fooled"", actually fool them in the story-telling so they can feel it and understand.) *** EMOTIONAL When people are asked to think analytically, they actually stop thinking emotionally. (Asking someone to calculate charity amount made them give less because suddenly they were less emotional about it.) Once we put on our analytical hat, we react to emotional appeals differently. We hinder our ability to feel. If we want to make people care, we have to tap into the things they care about. But if everyone is tapping into the same thing, loses effectiveness. Find associations that are distinctive for our ideas. Get self-interest into every headline you write. Suggest to readers that here is something they want. Spell out the benefit of the benefit. Just hearing about benefits, in the abstract, wasn't enough to lure additional subscribers. It was only when people put themselves in the starring role that their interest grew. You don't have to promise riches and sex appeal. It may be enough to promise reasonable benefits that people can *easily imagine* themselves enjoying. Company offers employees $1000 bonus if they meet performance targets. Three ways of presenting it to them: 1. ""Think of what $1000 means: down payment on new car, etc."" 2. ""Think of increased security of having $1000 in your bank."" 3. ""Think of what $1000 means: company recognizes how important you are. It doesn't spend money for nothing."" WHAT'S INTERESTING IS: When people are asked what is most appealing to them, they say #3. When people are asked what is most appealing to others, they say #1 and #2. This single insight explains everything about the way incentives are structured in most large organizations. Persuading someone to take a job: #1 - Think about security this job provides. It will always be needed. #2 - Think about visibility this job provides. Many people watching your performance. #3 - Think about how rewarding it will be to work in such a central job and learn how the company really works. Again, most people like #3 the best, but think others would like #1 or #2 the best. A lot of us think everyone else is living in Maslow's Basement, while we're in the Penthouse. In forming opinions, people seem to ask not ""What's in it for me?"", but rather, ""What's in it for my group?"" Company tried to give firefighters a popcorn popper if they came to watch a security video. But from an identity point of view, that's worse than offering nothing at all, because a firefighter identity would say, ""Firefighters aren't the type that need little gifts to watch a film on safety! We save lives! Shame on you for implying that I need a popcorn popper!"" To get people to care, tap into their sense of their own identities, like the ""Don't Mess With Texas!"" for littering. Group wanted to preserve the tradition of Duo Piano music. But the Curse of Knowledge prevented them from expressing the reasons why it should be preserved. They can't just say ""Preserve Duo Piano Music!"" and expect anyone but them to care. Keep asking ""Why?"" to remind us of the core values, core principles that underly our ideas. *** STORIES A story with built-in drama is much more interesting : bring people on the journey of mistake mystery and discovery to keep them interested, instead of just delivering the outcome. That way people can mentally test out how they would have handled the situation. Mental practice alone produces two-thirds of the benefits of actual physical practice. The right kind of story is effectively a simulation. There are three basic plot types: CHALLENGE PLOT David and Goliath. Protagonist overcomes formidable challenge and succeeds. Underdog. Rags to riches. Willpower over adversity. The obstacles seem daunting. CONNECTION PLOT People who develop a relationship that bridges a gap - racial, class, ethnic, religious, demographic, or otherwise. Inspire us in social ways. It's about our relationships with other people. CREATIVITY PLOT Involves someone making a mental breakthrough, solving a long-standing puzzle, tackling a problem in an innovative way. A Springboard Story : lets people see how an existing problem might change. Tell people about possibilities. When you hit listeners between the eyes, they respond by fighting back. If you make an argument, you're implicitly asking them to evaluate your argument. But with a story, you engage your audience. Good messages must move from common sense to uncommon sense. When people tell stories that only have the common sense, they're often remembering the entire journey in their heads, but only communicating the outcome.","Actually analyzing what makes certain ideas or stories more memorable than others! Fascinating. Apply this wisdom to your songs, bio/story, communication with fans, etc."
The Art of Profitability,Adrian Slywotzky,0446692271,9,"To succeed in business, you have to have a genuine interest in profitability. And most people don't. One of the ugliest moments in business is when the customer changes, the profit model changes, so the business design has to change. It's horrible. You don't want to move mentally because you've been so successful, yet you must move or you'll stagnate or go bankrupt. The more deeply you're enmeshed in yesterday's success system, the more impossible it is for you to imagine what tomorrow's success system will be. Innumeracy lesson: you can figure out all the answers with some basic information, calculations, and common sense. How many people really ask the right questions about a business plan, a new product launch, a major investment, a marketing campaign, an HR program? Many people in business aren't used to thinking this way. You can usually work out less than 7 calculations that will blow up an impressive but fatally-flawed business plan. Being able to take measure of the world is one of the most crucial skills we can develop. Always do the arithmetic. It's the strongest ally, truth detector, opportunity detector. 4 levels to learning : awareness, awkwardness, application, assimilation. Always ask ""why?"" 5 times. By the 5th time you'll start getting close to the real answer. To study successful businesses you have to visit their stores, factories, offices - try their products, test their services, spend time at their websites. Most important you've got to talk with their customers, live with them, get to know their needs, wants, problems by spending time with them, seeing what they do, what works for them & what doesn't. What annoys them & what makes their lives easy or productive or fun. You'll learn more from 1 hour with a customer then 50 research studies. Make notes on implications for your organization. Some questions to get you started: * - Which of these profit models are at work in my business? Can I identify others? * - How does profit happen in my competitors' businesses? * - What can I do in the next 90 days to intensify my organization's focus on profitability? * - Which profit models would enable us to maximize profit this year? * - Is my organization aligned to capitalize on the profit models in my business? ############################### CUSTOMER SOLUTION PROFIT Study customers, create a custom solution set with multiple services. Develop the relationship. Invest time and energy in learning all there is to know about your customers. Then use that knowledge to create specific solutions for them. Lose money for a short time. Make money for a long time. Once Factset identified a company as a potential customer, they'd send a team of 2-3 people to work there for a few months, learning everything they could about the customer, how their systems worked (& didn't work), what they really cared about. Based on this genuine knowledge, they'd develop customized products and services tailored to the specific characteristics and economics of the account. Once they landed the account, they spent a ton of time integrating their product into the customer's systems. During this process, revenues were tiny and costs were huge. But after 3-4 months, they were woven into the daily flow of customer's operations. Software debugged and working fine. Now one person could maintain account, part-time. More people in company use it. Costs fall, revenues grow. Potential applications: Anything, except where there is no relationship-building. Where does it NOT work? ############################### PYRAMID PROFIT Company caters to different levels of price sensitivity. Offer a range of services from low price / high volume to higher price and lower volume. The base of the pyramid consists of low-priced high-volume products, while the apex is made up of high-priced low-volume products. The bulk of profitability is concentrated at the top of the product pyramid, but the base plays a strategic role -- often through a ""firewall"" brand -- in protecting the profitability at the top. At Mattel: Barbie = $20-$30. But imitators can come in below you, so you build a firewall, a $10 Barbie. Barely profitable but prevents other companies from establishing a connection with your customers. And even girls who start with the $10 Barbie move on to buy accessories. Then made a $100-$200 Barbie for nostalgic collectors. Can't build a pyramid without understanding all of the customers: current and potential. Has to be more than just a collection of products at different price points. A true pyramid is a system in which the lower-priced products are manufactured and sold with so much efficiency that it's virtually impossible for a competitor to steal market share by underpricing you. A firewall. Premium gas = bad pyramid because there's no reason to buy the top one. American Express Platinum card = so-so pyramid for same reason. Can only be applied in a few situations: 1 out of 50. The customers themselves form a heirarchy, with different expectations and attitudes towards price. The pyramid is made to capture them all. Other examples: Nokia phones, Swatch, GM cars. Think of 10 more? ############################### MULTI-COMPONENT PROFIT Same product, several businesses. Offer a range of services that includes higher margin specialty items and loss leading, high demand services. Caters to customers that consolidate on fewer suppliers. Multiple products and/or sales channels, and only some of these represent the bulk of profitability. To maximize sales in the high-profitability components, it's necessary to have full presence in the less-profitable components as well. Different parts of a business can have wildly different profitability. The customer behaves very differently on different purchase occasions. Different degrees of price sensitivity. Coke per ounce: .02 in grocery store, .06 in vending machine, .12 in restaurant Hotel: single room for 1 night, one-day meeting for 20 people, three-day convention for 3000 people. Bookstore: foot-traffic component, ecommerce component, book-club component, corporate-purchasing component. Story of guy who saw bookstore could be a base for building several new high-profit components: corporate business, book-group business, personal service business. Dramatically intensify outbound selling activities. Have a couple account managers call on corporate libraries and HR depts to promote latest business books. Services to local book groups. Promoting sales to high-purchase individuals. (Their best customers bought $500/year, but never realized these people represented a separate component of their business that they could consciously deliberately target and grow.) With little increase in labor (+ 2 account managers) and no increase in assets, bookstores that were barely surviving turned into obscsenely profitable businesses. Developed 200 company accounts (corps, law firms, accountants), 200 book groups, 500 high-purchase individuals. Increased not just sales but customer satisfaction, flow of info as to what customers wanted. (in $M) trad-only trad+outbound revenue 10 12 cost 9.9 11 profit 0.1 1.0 salesreturn 1% 8% assets 3 3 assetreturn 3% 33% ############################### SWITCHBOARD PROFIT Multiple sellers communicating with multiple buyers via a power broker associated with the service provider. The more buyers and sellers that join the switchboard, the larger the margin commanded by the service provider. Ovitz put most of entire movie needs together: representing writer, actors, director. Can't do it with a small niche: once you have 15-20% of market, an upward spiral kicks in. Perceived probabilities go way up, and all deals start flowing your direction. More profitable because agent's cut of so many players in one deal. Also, by representing a team rather than individual, far better bargaining power. Probability of striking a deal goes way way up. Studio has to deal with you. Profitability per unit of effort and unit of time is probably 7-10 times greater than in the traditional model. Examples: EBAY, Wilson & Sonsini (Silicon Valley startups), Michael Ovits (Hollywood deals) ############################### TIME PROFIT Takes advantage of innovation, newness, uniqueness, to gain time limited competitive advantage. Requires strong early sales effort to maximize high margin revenue. Profit margins quickly erode as competition catches-up. When a product is new, it earns premium profits. Then, when a competitor copies the innovation, price competition drives profits to zero. Companies relying on this model make continuous innovation the modus operandi. Invent. Then make a ton of money before the imitation starts. Needs instant diffusion: a faster way to squeeze out the juice before everyone else learns the secret. Systemize: 2 weeks before announcing a new product, email 200 clients letting them know it's on the way, a week in advance call them to tell them again, a few days before launch train all employees covering every detail of it until everyone is ready to cover every detail of it in their sleep. Launch Monday and sign up a ton of people immediately. What separates winners and losers in innovation is who masters the drudgery. The creative process usually starts with a brilliant idea. Next you determine whether, if the brilliant idea worked, it would be worth doing from a business standpoint. That's exhilarating and most stimulating part, but it's also the easiest. Then comes the real work: reducing the idea to practice. That's the drudgery part, and the part where people need the most pressure and encouragement. People go into pits as they try to turn that idea into products that can be manufactured. Examples: Intel (CPUs), Apple (iPod) ############################### BLOCKBUSTER PROFIT Similar to Time Profit with Revenue realized is so powerful and fast that in a quick swoop the model pays for often high service development and marketing costs. Projects in R&D that have trivial value are left to die. Big winners get tremendous amount of workover, discussion, debate, attention. Get everyone focused on new key questions: How can we increase the feasibility level of the big projects? Can we parallel-process? can we get more studies done to improve their positioning? What will it take to hit a home run? Get everyone developing it as excited as possible. Go into total risk-management mode to remove as much uncertainty as possible. Develop an imaginary portfolio of the top 15 blockbuster opportunities in your market, whether or not you have a corresponding product. Search for all you're not doing: assign at least one research molecule directed at each of the 15. In ""A Technique for Producing Ideas"", study front-end loading: putting the cramming in the beginning. Total immersion, early. Read as much as you can as fast as you can all at the beginning. You get a structure of knowledge that's incomplete but powerful because every new fact or idea you run into later gets integrated into an evolving structure that keps getting stronger over time. Examples: Movie Studios, Book Publishers, Drug Makers ############################### PROFIT-MULTIPLIER MODEL Taking one skill and making money from it 5 or 6 times. Take any asset, iterate it, reuse it, give it a different form. Better profit from lower development cost. Don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you use it. Improves the odds of success for the development you've already done. Different from the Multi-Component profit because it's not the same product : it's different products from the same original asset. Leverage brand to multiply the value of one service by selling loosely related services under the same branding. Example: Disney sells one service (movies) and then leverages brand to sell toys, clothing, dvds, theme park attractions, etc. ############################### ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFIT Totally aligns an organization behind rational, common sense, profit-seeking activity, rather than all the extraneous nonsense that only large organizations can afford or tolerate. A simple mindset that says, ""We can't afford to operate any other way."". Jack is cheap, precise. More detailed knowledge of where all his nickels are than most people have of their $20 bills. Preaches frugality with passion. A psychology of saving. Challenges necessities. Does meetings by phone instead of in-person. Gets rock-bottom prices from suppliers, making them understand how they'll benefit if Jack can keep growing twice as fast as the rest of his industry. Plans in advance, hyperorganized. Creativity and new ideas for better ways of doing things. Delays expenses. Asks hard and well-informed questions about every expense. Copies shamelessly from competitors. Holds contests among employees to test frontiers of great performance. Throws parties to celebrate star performers. Experiments a lot. When it fails, he cuts back quickly. When it works, he pours it on. Some employees can't handle the pressure. The ones who stay are excited and engaged. Hierarchical design with multiple subsidiaries to maintain startup-like customer responsiveness, energy and efficiency. ############################### SPECIALIST PROFIT Specialists are several times more profitable than the generalist. Characterized by lower cost, higher quality, stronger reputation, shorter selling cycles, and better price realization. Lower cost through better knowledge. Better price through reputation or unique design of offering. Shorter selling cycle. More rapid & universal penetration because of wired effect. Windfall profits because of high-value high-margin answers throughout the marketplace. The difference in profitability between generalist and specialist will be 10-15 points of margin. When generalists break even, specialists make 15%. When generalists make 10%, specialists make 25%. Example: Southwest (one jet type) ############################### INSTALLED BASE PROFIT Initial product sales or profits are slim and profit is realized on follow-up products and services. Two buckets: (1) hardware. 2-5% profit. new demand. bigger price sensitivity. customer has power. (2) consumables. 10-15% profit. continuing demand. less price sensitivity. seller has power. Seller can fuck up by making price too high so customer switches brands. Or if sellers doesn't work to make it easy for customer to buy: early notice, reminders, multiple units per follow-up sale, turning passive receipt into stimulating usage and growth. Take some aspect of your business where customers are returning naturally and stimulate it more - market aggressively. Let customers guide you : they're the ones who decide what they're willing to pay for, and how much. Examples: All suppliers of laser printers and video game players. Sony (Playstation), Hewlett Packard (printers, cameras), Canon (printers, cameras), Gillette (razors) ############################### DE FACTO STANDARD PROFIT The more players who buy that enter in the system, the more valuable the network. Being the standards gets you plannability - less surprise. (Surprises cost money by causing you to react, respond, scramble.) Your customers do your marketing for you. Examples: Microsoft, Apache, SAP, and eBay ############################### BRAND PROFIT The company expends significant marketing investment in order to build awareness and is reinforced by customer experience. You know Brand is working when a consumer says, ""I only drink Coke"" even-though blind tests show consumers are often unable to distinguish the difference between Coke and its competitors. Examples: Coke, Crest, Singapore Airlines, Acura ############################### SPECIALTY PRODUCT PROFIT Similar to brand profit but companies use above standard materials and design to generate higher margins until competitors start to imitate. The dyestuff business had been a specialty product business like big pharma. Lots of little unique patented products with huge margins. 10 years ago, 80% of profits came from those. Now 80% of profits are from commodity stuff. The profit model shifted from specialty product to cost-and-cycle management. Key is to develop new niche products. Difference from Blockbuster is that this is niche: specialty foods, specialty papers, etc. Finding a legitimate need or variation and addressing it. Examples: Apple (computers), Ben and Jerry’s (ice cream), Prada (shoes), Tumi (bags) ############################### LOCAL LEADERSHIP PROFIT Many businesses and their company economies are totally local. Risk occurs when these companies fail to recognize they are a local business model. Purchasing costs are lower, capture most better traffic locations, recruiting and advertising work better. Every store is like a billboard. Slightly higher pricing. Fill a county. Read Sam Walton Made In America and Shultz' Pour Your Heart Into it for examples of local leadership. Examples: Walmart, Starbucks ############################### TRANSACTION SCALE PROFIT Real estate woman who only sells $1M+ houses. Paid attention only to that market. What kind of people. Studied for 7 years. You get to the big transactions through great relationships. NOT: ""You take whatever business you can get."" (that's what every salesman says about every customer. got to get the revenue, no matter how unprofitable it might be.) But you can't get to the big transactions just by wanting to : you have to take risks to bias yourself toward the big business. Turn small business away to concentrate on the big accounts. Needs skill, persistence, reference development. How many doors did you refuse to enter? Drawn to the shiny lure of the next thing that came up. Losing sense of long-term self-interest, strategy, the smart thing to do. Revenue increases proportionately with transaction volume but materials, construction, and or distribution costs do not. Examples: Microsoft (Office software), Morgan Stanley (finance deals), Yahoo (website hosting) ############################### VALUE CHAIN POSITION PROFIT ""He who occupies the mountain pass can easily battle a thousand."" What's true in geography is true in business. There are places in the value chain that are 10 times more valuable than others in terms of profit, power, control. When earthquakes or floods happen, the location of these special places changes, making some vulnerable and others blessed. Intel and Microsoft as suppliers to the industry. Would you rather be Wal-Mart or a supplier to Wal-Mart? (Wal-Mart) Would you rather be Tom Clancy or his publisher? (Tom Clancy) Note pre-existing control points. (There are none: they're conditional depending on the circumstances: relative value added, trajectory. MS + Intel vs PC makers. Wal-Mart vs suppliers. Creation of scarcity. Capturing bottleneck. Connection to the customer: a better connection than the other value-chain players have. Profit from predictability. The company that owns the control point sets the pace. Its business plan defines the future. The others react, always a step behind.) Note radical shifts in control points. 3 shifts from integrated system to specialists who control the action: computing, athletic shoes, Hollywood. Note new control points that will arise in the next 2 years. Partner with other members of the value chain (suppliers) to provide a more complete customer oriented service. Example: Cingular (partners with Motorola, Sony, insurer to sell Walkman mobile phone) ############################### CYCLE PROFIT Industries characterized by distinct and powerful cycle. The company can not control the cycle, but it works to maximize its position within the cycles grip. As capacity tightens the companies lead price increases, as capacity loosens, its lag price declines. Drive down the breakeven point. Reduce fixed costs. When others lose money, they break even. When others break even, they profit. Permanently ahead. Example: Travel industry (adjust rates seasonally) ############################### AFTER-SALE PROFIT Price sensitivity changes for different purchase occasions. Low sensitivity on coffee is what made Starbucks ($2-$3 for a 10-cent cup). For a TV it's high: people price-shop relentlessly. Airfare and cars: the highest. But people will pay top dollar for a car in big demand. Price sensitivity is lowest when ticket price is low and there are few options. The action starts with the high-visibility big-ticket sale. Computers, cars, equipment. Buyers go to the wall to get the lowest price. Their zeal drives the profit out. But the initial transaction creates a new situation: a need for follow-up stuff that did not exist before. You didn't need the service contract before you bought the elevator, PC, pickup truck. Didn't need the replacement parts or accessories. A whole new minimarket created by the initial sale. Ticket prices are tiny. Frequency of purchase is greater. Similarities to Installed Base model, except in this one, lots of different companies can benefit. Big-ticket companies should customize the after-sale stuff to the original sale product, so the customer has a compelling reason to buy the after-sale items and services from them. Work hard to turn the after-sale profit model into the installed base profit model. But selling this after-sale stuff is so unglamorous that many less are shooting for it : you can quietly sell service contracts and insurance for a lot of profit. Needs a very different organization focused only on that. Company sells financing and services to support equipment and goods originally purchased from other suppliers. Example: General Electric (nuclear power plant services, auto loans, insurance) ############################### NEW PRODUCT PROFIT Profit explosion happens at the beginning, during the gold-rush days. Margins are fat and volume is skyrocketing. Multiply these two and you get a growing ocean of profitability. The Profit Parabola |_/\_ ""The total profit earned by all players in a market goes up, peaks, and comes back down to zero."" Theory supported by: radios, tvs, vcrs, walkmans, desktops, laptops, servers, sedans, minivans, suvs, faxes, fax-printers, fax-printer-copiers. Starts with Gold Rush, goes to Pike's Peak, then No Profit Zone. Problem is: during the Gold Rush, swept into the psychology, into the zone where even weak producers make money because demand is so strong. You can't think clearly about how to manage strategically. Step #1: admit this is all true. (It's like a 22-year-old admitting he'll get old and impotent.) Step #2: manage Parabola strategically: Overinvest by a factor of 3 on the left-hand side, and underinvest by a factor of 3 on the right-hand side. On the left-hand side fight for mindshare, be seen as the leader. Be everywhere. Start measuring things that will give you clues you're at Pike's Peak. Growth rates. Customer excitement or boredom. Then reverse the investment ratio a year before hitting the peak. Not getting out of the market, just managing the business to maximize cash flow and minimize the risk profile on the other side. Start building flexible plants instead of dedicated ones. Look for opportunities to sell dedicated plants to inevitable latecomers who still wanted to get into the game. Be in a great position when things start getting ugly. Pull back on advertising, since everyone knows you from early mindshare grab. Serve the good customers & drop some bad ones. Then be looking for the next wave. Spend a tremendous amount of time scouting the lanscape, looking for early signals of the inflection. Time Profit: 2-year cycle, speed, race car, ""when you see #2 in the rear-view mirror, step on the gas"". Chips, electronics. New Profit Product: 4-year cycle, shift resources, surfing, ""get off the last wave first, get on the new wave first"". Cars, copiers. Specialty Product Profit: 10-year cycle, select, seismography, ""find the richest fields: the place where customer need, technical feasibility, and lack of competition intersect"" ############################### RELATIVE MARKET SHARE PROFIT Companies with high market share tend to be more profitable. Large companies have price advantages due to manufacturing experiences and volume economies from better supplier relationships. Invest to win. Build a bigger lead. If you try and fail, cut your losses or get out completely. (Jack Welch was its most thoughtful practitioner.) Economics of scale. Purchasing advantage. Marketing & advertising. Because lowest overhead per-unit, spread costs over greater volumes than any other competitor. Attract the best talent in the industry. Biggest cash flow, so can outspend rivals. Leader has least volatility, lowest risk. Controlled initiative while others react. Used to think profit was just Relative Market Share, but it's function of many things: time, location, offering, local Relative Market Share. ############################### EXPERIENCE CURVE PROFIT Experience in serving the market and strong financial management drives down the transactional cost. (Basically just continuing to optimize?) Danger is focusing on this too much and losing peripheral vision. (Focus + Peripheral Vision = 100%. The less you have of one, the more you have of the other.) Microscope versus radar screen. Can't be looking at both at the same time. At the edge of the radar screen is where new things come to make you irrelevant, or the invention of a new model that delivers the same thing at a 20-30% lower cost, like Southwest Airlines, Dell Computer, Nucor steel, Wal-Mart, Geico, Home Depot. Incumbents are busy managing costs, and someone comes along to introduce the next system. See next point... ############################### LOW-COST BUSINESS DESIGN PROFIT The company thrives on reducing the cost per unit through cumulative experience. You might need two organizations: the experience-curve incumbent and the blank-sheet-of-paper gang. Maximizing your current hand while simultaneously buying a big insurance policy on the future. The low-cost business design doesn't need huge market share to be hugely profitable. It is hugely profitable as long as it continues to be dramatically lower-cost. Value Migration (book): how you have to change your business design every 5 years. (Though it takes 2-3 years to change!) So you need to see it coming, start preparing for it. Give yourself a 2-year runway to get the new business design off the ground. Start sooner. Move faster. Anticipate. ############################### DIGITAL PROFIT: (duh) from http://www.wjones.com/profit/profit/profit_forms.html : *** Flawless Transaction Profit Design expectation exceeding efficiency and elegance into each stage of the service transaction. Fosters a strong, passionate bond between customer and brand. Examples: Apple, Dell, Ritz Carlton *** Intellectual Property Profit Similar to Time Profit with government protected competitive advantage expiring with patent or copyright. Examples: Drug Makers, 3M (Post-It) *** Big Bang Profit Drive sales with a clear, strongly advertised message that has high market recall. Examples: Afflak (supplementary insurance, advertising duck), IBM e-Business *** Buzz Play Profit: Invest in Public Relations to generate industry and customer chatter to drive sales. Often requires secrecy and controlled leaks to information hubs. Examples: George Lucas (Star Wars), Apple (Macworld Conference), Harry Potter publishing franchise *** Focus Profit: Define limited, high value service priorities. Reduce costs in areas not associated with priorities. Focus brand, service development, customer support, investment on priorities. Examples: IBM e-Business *** Build-to-Order Profit: Services are purchased before construction costs are incurred. *** Geopolitical Profit: Services are produced to maximize value of government factors in competition and costs of taxes, levies and business processes required by regulation. *** Global Sourcing Profit: The company selects operating locations for design, materials, construction and distribution to take advantage of better quality, lower cost natural resources, human resources, infrastructure and markets. *** Governance Profit: Policies and procedures are structured to identify and mitigate risks early in service development process. For companies with typically high costs due to liability. *** Automation Profit: Company achieves greater cost efficiencies over competitors via better use of technology in materials, construction or delivery. *** Liquidation Profit: Company sells non-core assets to reduce costs and increase short term profits. *** Process Improvement Profit: Company reduces manufacturing costs by reducing rework and improving plant output via techniques such as Six Sigma and Total Quality Management. *** Price Cut Profit: Trim prices to grow revenue In a price sensitive Market. In industries where the unit margin (difference between sale price and cost for a unit sold) is high, then month over month revenue growth will likely be more important to growing profit. *** Global Expansion Profit: Take existing products and expand into new international markets. Requires development of low cost distribution channels, localized marketing expertise, and localized legal and geopolitical expertise to minimize risks that could eliminate profitability.","25 different models of profitability presented in examples you can relate to your own business, making you realize profit-sources you’d never thought of before."
The Practice,Seth Godin,0593328973,8,"Creativity is the result of desire to find a new truth, solve an old problem, or serve someone. Process saves us from the poverty of our intentions. Askıda ekmek: there is bread on the hook. It’s an ancient tradition in Turkey. When buying a loaf at the local bakery, you can choose to pay for an extra loaf and, after bagging your purchase, the owner will hang the second loaf on a hook on the wall. If a person in need comes by, he or she can ask if there’s anything on the hook. Art is the work we do where there is no right answer - and yet the journey is worth the effort. Art is what we call it when we’re able to create something new that changes someone. No change, no art. You can’t always do much about how you feel, particularly when it’s about something important, but you can always control your actions. Your work is too important to be left to how you feel today. If you condition yourself to work without flow, it’s more likely to arrive. The strategy of “seeking your calling” gives you a marvelous place to hide. Only after we do the difficult work does it become our calling. Only after we trust the process does it become our passion. “Do what you love” is for amateurs. Love what you do. In this window of ten to thirteen years’ old, all of these kids decided they wanted to become musicians. They developed the habit of identity. When they looked in the mirror, they saw themselves as musicians, as artists, as people who had committed to a journey. Focus on the practice alone. Focus on the rhythm, on posture, on the magic of the physics of it. The catch is the side effect of the practice itself. Process saves us from the poverty of our intentions. When was the last time you did something for the first time? Nostalgia for a future that hasn’t happened yet is a modern affliction. The easiest way to go through life is to let life go through you. Give in to the prevailing winds and go along to get along. This requires very little effort because you’re not working with intent - at least not your own intent. You’re getting by. A sailboat goes slowest when it is going downwind. That’s because the sail acts as a parachute, meaning the boat can’t go any faster than the wind behind it. The sailboat is optimized to go across the wind. We make a difference in the world when we seek to make a difference. Problems have solutions. That’s what makes them problems. A problem without a solution isn’t a problem, it’s simply a situation. Problems are usually solved by surprising, non-trivial alternatives. If an obvious solution from an obvious source could have provided an answer, it would have happened already. The word “peculiar” simply means specific. If you spend all day hitting the ball back, you’ll never end up serving. Responding or reacting to incoming asks becomes the narration of your days. If your no becomes a habit, a way to hide out, you may end up cutting ties with the very people you set out to serve. And if your no becomes too seductive, you can get comfortable there instead, never actually shipping your work, because shipping your work means that you’ll need to reenter the world with a yes. To a drowning man, everyone else is a stepping-stone. The more important the project we take on, the more difficult it is to find certainty that our work will succeed before we begin. Any idea withheld is an idea taken away. It’s selfish to hold back when there’s a chance you have something to offer. Talent is something we’re born with: it’s in our DNA, a magical alignment of gifts. But skill? Skill is earned. It’s learned and practiced and hard-won. It’s insulting to call a professional talented. She’s skilled. Skill is rarer than talent. Skill is earned. The market pushes creators to give away their work. Too often, we come to believe that giving it away, removing money from the interaction, is the most generous thing we can do. But that’s not the case. Money supports our commitment to the practice. Money permits us to turn professional, to focus our energy and our time on the work, creating more impact and more connection, not less. Money is how our society signifies enrollment. The person who has paid for your scarce time and scarce output is more likely to value it, to share it, and to take it seriously. Going from town to town and working with easy gigs was wasting their effort and hiding their art. What they needed to do was stay in one town, earn fans, play again, earn fans, move to a better venue, and do it again. Better clients demand better work. Better clients want you to push the envelope, win awards, and challenge their expectations. Better clients pay on time. Better clients talk about you and your work. But finding better clients isn’t easy, partly because we don’t trust ourselves enough to imagine that we deserve them. How is it possible for three cowboys to herd a thousand cattle? Easy. They don’t. They herd ten cattle, and those cattle influence fifty cattle and those cattle influence the rest. That’s the way every single widespread movement/product/service has changed the world. Find ten people who care enough about your work to enroll. Everything weighs something, everything takes up space. Nothing goes on a lunar module unless there’s a really good reason. What’s the headline for in this magazine ad? What’s the save button for on this word processor? What’s the airport announcement about security alerts for? What is the “letters to the editor” section of the newspaper for? What is a large front lawn on a suburban McMansion for? If you think hard about these questions, you might discover that a lot of what we build or encounter isn’t about what we think it is. Instead of making paintings to please the skeptics, she made art for people who were enrolled in the path toward the new. All of us get an endless supply of ideas, notions, and inklings. Successful people, often without realizing it, ignore the ones that are less likely to “work,” and instead focus on the projects that are more likely to advance the mission. Sometimes we call this good taste. It’s possible to get better at this pre-filtering. By doing it out loud. By writing out the factors that you’re seeking, or even by explaining to someone else how your part of the world works. Hey, little kid, why are you crying? What’s the tantrum for? He has no idea. He’s a toddler. The toddler is authentic. The hallmark of the unmindful is to react, to lash out, to spend time with no purpose or measure. This is a practice. It has a purpose. I desire to create change. The change is for someone specific. How can I do it better? Can I persist long enough to do it again? Repeat. Inauthentic means effective, reasoned, intentional. It means it’s not personal, it’s generous. He screened his films for a paying audience. Fifty cents, a dollar, it didn’t matter, as long as they paid something. He discovered early on that paying audiences cared more and demanded more. Again and again, his work was booed and met with derision. Paying money gave you the right to boo. It’s fine to experience regret when we abandon a sunk cost. It’s a mistake to stick with one simply because we can’t bear the regret. Write more. Write about your audience, your craft, your challenges. Write about the trade-offs, the industry, and your genre. Write about your dreams and your fears. Write about what’s funny and what’s not. Write to clarify. Write to challenge yourself. Write on a regular schedule. Writing puts you on the hook. Desirable difficulty is actually required for us to upskill and move to another level. Befriending your bad ideas is a useful way forward. They’re not your enemy. They are essential steps on the path to better. Get a pencil. That’s what’s scarce. People who will draw up plans. People who will go first. After that, you can easily get help from one of the people who are good at using sandpaper, now that you’ve done just about all of the scary bits. Promise to ship, but don’t promise the result. Shawn Coyne has written brilliantly about genre. If we choose a genre, we’ve just made a series of promises. If you tell us that this is a reggae record, we’re going to compare you to Bob Marley. If you assert that you’re painting fine art, you’ve got a thousand years of artists to stand next to. It’s so much easier to say, “It’s just me.” It’s simply what I felt like creating. Because then we’ll ignore you. And then you’re off the hook. Don’t talk about your dreams with people who want to protect you from heartache. Seek the smallest viable audience. Make it for someone, not everyone. Build streaks. Do the work every single day. Blog daily. Write daily. Ship daily. Show up daily. Find your streak and maintain it. Talk about your streaks to keep honest. Culture is a conspiracy. It’s the voluntary engagement of humans in search of connection and safety. People at higher levels of performance don’t spend more hours training. Athletes at the highest level had just as many friends and just as normal a life as dedicated swimmers at lower levels. There were two key differences between great competitors and good ones: Skill: The best swimmers swim differently than the ones who don’t perform as well. They do their strokes differently; they do their turns differently. These are learned and practiced skills. Attitude: The best swimmers bring a different attitude to their training. They choose to find delight in the parts that other swimmers avoid. This is their practice. It’s not training hours or DNA that changes outcomes. It’s our belief in possibility and the support of the culture around us. Creators have a better attitude, because they’ve figured out how to trust the process and trust themselves to work with it. When you’re surrounded by respected peers, it’s more likely you’ll do the work you set out to do. Outsource many of the things you’re not very good at, so that you can simulate a level of sanity and professionalism to the outside world. Choose the skill we’re going to assert to the outside world. Even if it comes at the cost of neglecting some of the work you used to do that, in the end, was simply a distraction. Teach people to make commitments, to overcome fear, to deal transparently, to initiate, and to plan a course of action. Teach people to desire lifelong learning, to express themselves, and to innovate. People around the world eat what they eat because of community standards and the way culture is inculcated into what they do. Expectations matter a great deal. When you have no real choice but to grow up doing something or eating something or singing something, then you do it. Is culture able to teach us a process to make art? Isn’t it possible for the culture to normalize goal setting and passion and curiosity and the ability to persuade? The renowned screenwriter and showrunner, has seen more movies than you have. His understanding of what’s come before gives him the platform and the standing to help figure out what’s going to come next. The point is not to copy, but in fact to avoid copying. Our best commercial work reminds people of what they’ve seen before. This little corner of this little industry was the place he chose to make a difference. The change we seek to make can feel small indeed, but it all ripples.","Classic Seth Godin. If you liked his previous books, you’ll love this. The subtitle “Shipping Creative Work” sums it up well. Very encouraging and motivating."
The Psychology of Money,Morgan Housel,0857197681,8,"Study the history of greed, insecurity, and optimism. History never repeats itself. Man always does. The person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk and reward in ways the child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom. The Australian who hasn’t seen a recession in 30 years has experienced something no American ever has. People’s lifetime investment decisions are heavily anchored to the experiences those investors had in their own generation - especially experiences early in their adult life. Individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history. Not intelligence, or education, or sophistication. Just the dumb luck of when and where you were born. Their view of money was formed in different worlds. Every transaction he agreed to broke the law. “You don’t suppose you can run a railroad in accordance with the statutes of the State of New York, do you?” Laws didn’t accommodate railroads during Vanderbilt’s day. So he said “to hell with it” and went ahead anyway. You can praise Vanderbilt for flaunting the law with as much passion as you criticize Enron for doing the same. Perhaps one got lucky by avoiding the arm of the law while the other found itself on the side of risk. You’ll get closer to actionable takeaways by looking for broad patterns of success and failure. The more common the pattern, the more applicable it might be to your life. Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose. Failure can be a lousy teacher, because it seduces smart people into thinking their decisions were terrible when sometimes they just reflect the unforgiving realities of risk. Arrange your financial life in a way that a bad investment here and a missed financial goal there won’t wipe you out so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor. To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. An insatiable appetite for more will push you to the point of regret. Warren Buffett’s net worth is $84.5 billion. Of that, $84.2 billion was accumulated after his 50th birthday. $81.5 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. Had he started investing in his 30s and retired in his 60s, few people would have ever heard of him. Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old. By the time he was 30 he had a net worth of $1 million, or $9.3 million adjusted for inflation. What if he was a more normal person, spending his teens and 20s exploring the world and finding his passion, and by age 30 his net worth was, say, $25,000? And let’s say he still went on to earn the extraordinary annual investment returns he’s been able to generate (22% annually), but quit investing and retired at age 60 to play golf and spend time with his grandkids. What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today? Not $84.5 billion. $11.9 million. 99.9% less than his actual net worth. His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That’s how compounding works. Linear thinking is so much more intuitive than exponential thinking. If I ask you to calculate 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8 in your head, you can do it in a few seconds (it’s 72). If I ask you to calculate 8×8×8×8×8×8×8×8×8, your head will explode (it’s 134,217,728). There are books on economic cycles, trading strategies, and sector bets. But the most powerful and important book should be called Shut Up And Wait. It’s just one page with a long-term chart of economic growth. Only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia. To summarize money success in a single word it would be “survival.” Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. Buffett achieved his investment returns: He didn’t get carried away with debt. He didn’t panic and sell during the 14 recessions he’s lived through. He didn’t attach himself to one strategy, one world view, or one passing trend. He didn’t rely on others’ money (managing investments through a public company meant investors couldn’t withdraw their capital). He didn’t burn himself out and quit or retire. He survived. More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. The great art dealers operated like index funds. They bought everything they could. And they bought it in portfolios, not individual pieces they happened to like. Then they sat and waited for a few winners to emerge. That’s all that happens. Perhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired in his life turned out to be of little value. But that doesn’t particularly matter if the other 1% turn out to be the work of someone like Picasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end up stupendously right. A lot of things in business and investing work this way. Since 1980, 40% of all Russell 3000 stock components lost at least 70% of their value and never recovered over this period. Effectively all of the index’s overall returns came from 7% of component companies that outperformed. In 2018, Amazon drove 6% of the S&P 500’s returns. And Amazon’s growth is almost entirely due to Prime and Amazon Web Services, which itself are tail events in a company that has experimented with hundreds of products, from the Fire Phone to travel agencies. Apple was responsible for almost 7% of the index’s returns in 2018. And it is driven overwhelmingly by the iPhone. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once announced his company was canceling several big-budget productions. He responded: Our hit ratio is way too high right now. I’m always pushing the content team. We have to take more risk. You have to try more crazy things, because we should have a higher cancel rate overall. These are not delusions or failures of responsibility. They are a smart acknowledgement of how tails drive success. The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.” Your kids don’t want your money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with them. Wealth is what you don’t see. Wealth is the nice cars not purchased, watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined. Wealth is financial assets that haven’t yet been converted into the stuff you see. If you spend money on things, you will end up with the things and not the money. Wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. When most people say they want to be a millionaire, what they might actually mean is “I’d like to spend a million dollars.” And that is literally the opposite of being a millionaire. Say you and I have the same net worth. And say you’re a better investor than me. I can earn 8% annual returns and you can earn 12% annual returns. But I’m more efficient with my money. Let’s say I need half as much money to be happy while your lifestyle compounds as fast as your assets. I’m better off than you are, despite being a worse investor. I’m getting more benefit from my investments despite lower returns. The same is true for incomes. Learning to be happy with less money creates a gap between what you have and what you want - similar to the gap you get from growing your paycheck, but easier and more in your control. A high savings rate means having lower expenses than you otherwise could, and having lower expenses means your savings go farther than they would if you spent more. Think about this in the context of how much time and effort goes into achieving 0.1% of annual investment outperformance - millions of hours of research, tens of billions of dollars of effort from professionals - and it’s easy to see what’s potentially more important or worth chasing. There are A trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets” fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress. Investing is not a hard science. Experience leads to overconfidence more than forecasting ability. The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising. History can be a misleading guide to the future of the economy and stock market because it doesn’t account for structural changes that are relevant to today’s world. S&P 500 did not include financial stocks until 1976; today, financials make up 16% of the index. Technology stocks were virtually nonexistent 50 years ago. Today, they’re more than a fifth of the index. Accounting rules have changed over time. So have disclosures, auditing, and the amount of market liquidity. Things changed. There are plenty of theories on why recessions have become less frequent. It doesn’t particularly matter what caused the change. What matters is that things clearly changed. Graham’s classic book, The Intelligent Investor: When you try applying some of these formulas: few of them actually work. Graham advocated purchasing stocks trading for less than their net working assets - basically cash in the bank minus all debts. This sounds great, but few stocks actually trade that cheaply anymore - other than, say, a penny stock accused of accounting fraud. One of Graham’s criteria instructs conservative investors to avoid stocks trading for more than 1.5 times book value. If you followed this rule over the last decade you would have owned almost nothing but insurance and bank stocks. There is no world where that is OK. Just before he died Graham was asked whether detailed analysis of individual stocks - a tactic he became famous for - remained a strategy he favored. He answered: In general, no. I am no longer an advocate of elaborate techniques of security analysis in order to find superior value opportunities. This was a rewarding activity, say, 40 years ago, when our textbook was first published. But the situation has changed a great deal since then. What changed was: Competition grew as opportunities became well known; technology made information more accessible; and industries changed as the economy shifted from industrial to technology sectors, which have different business cycles and capital uses. Things changed. An interesting quirk of investing history is that the further back you look, the more likely you are to be examining a world that no longer applies to today. Many investors and economists take comfort in knowing their forecasts are backed up by decades, even centuries, of data. But since economies evolve, recent history is often the best guide to the future, because it’s more likely to include important conditions that are relevant to the future. The twelve most dangerous words in investing are, “The four most dangerous words in investing are, ‘it’s different this time.’” The further back in history you look, the more general your takeaways should be. General things like people’s relationship to greed and fear, how they behave under stress, and how they respond to incentives tend to be stable in time. The history of money is useful for that kind of stuff. But specific trends, specific trades, specific sectors, specific causal relationships about markets, and what people should do with their money are always an example of evolution in progress. Historians are not prophets. Examples of smart financial behavior can be found in blackjack players who practice card counting. Bet more when the odds of getting a card you want are in your favor and less when they are against you. Their strategy relies entirely on humility - humility that they don’t know, and cannot know exactly what’s going to happen next, so play their hand accordingly. The card counting system works because it tilts. The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary. I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average. So I save more than I would if I assumed the future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety. When analyzing other people’s home renovation plans, most people estimate the project will run between 25% and 50% over budget. But when it comes to their own projects, people estimate that renovations will be completed on time and at budget. “The best way to achieve felicity is to aim low,” says Charlie Munger. All of us are walking around with an illusion - an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. We tend to never learn this lesson. People from age 18 to 68 underestimate how much they will change in the future. Charlie Munger says the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily. Optimism is a belief that the odds of a good outcome are in your favor over time, even when there will be setbacks along the way. Optimism is the best bet for most people because the world tends to get better for most people most of the time. Pessimism sounds smarter. It’s intellectually captivating, and it’s paid more attention than optimism. Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism. Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention. Say we’ll have a big recession and newspapers will call you. Say we’re headed for average growth and no one particularly cares. Say we’re nearing the next Great Depression and you’ll get on TV. The investing newsletter industry has known this for years, and is now populated by prophets of doom despite operating in an environment where the stock market has gone up 17,000-fold in the last century. Extremely good and extremely bad circumstances rarely stay that way for long because supply and demand adapt. Between 2007 and 2009: The same knowledge, the same tools, the same ideas. Nothing changed! Why were we poorer? Why were we more pessimistic? Only one change: The stories we told ourselves about the economy. In 2007, we told a story about the stability of housing prices, the prudence of bankers, and the ability of financial markets to accurately price risk. In 2009 we stopped believing that story. That’s the only thing that changed. But it made all the difference in the world. The independent feeling I get from owning our house outright far exceeds the known financial gain I’d get from leveraging our assets with a cheap mortgage. Eliminating the monthly payment feels better than maximizing the long-term value of our assets. It makes me feel independent. On paper it’s defenseless. But it works for us. We like it. That’s what matters. Good decisions aren’t always rational.","Thoughts on wealth, greed, and happiness. Good insights into the investing mindset. Well-written without fluff.

Stillness Is the Key,n Holiday,0525538585,8,"Stillness aims the archer’s arrow. Stillness sharpens perspective and illuminates connections. Stillness generates a vision, helps us resist the passions of the mob. A leader and decision maker's job is not to “go with the gut” or fixate on the first impression formed an issue. Be strong enough to resist thinking that is too neat, too plausible, and therefore almost always wrong. Be fully present. Empty our mind of preconceptions. Take our time. Sit quietly and reflect. Reject distraction. Weigh advice against the counsel of our convictions. Deliberate without being paralyzed. Cultivate mental stillness. The hardest thing is actually doing something that is close to nothing. It demands all of you. There is no object to hide behind. It’s just you. See the world like an artist: the mind, fully engaged, notice what really surrounds you. Don’t reject a difficult or boring moment because it is not exactly what you want. Napoleon told messengers to wake him with crisis immediately, but wait three weeks before opening any correspondence. When he finally did hear what was in a letter, Napoleon loved to note how many supposedly “important” issues had simply resolved themselves and no longer required a reply. Filter out the inconsequential from the essential. It’s very difficult to think or act clearly when we are drowning in information. Limit the amount of people who have access to the boss. Gatekeepers: no more drop-ins, tidbits, and stray reports. So the boss can see the big picture. So the boss has time and room to think. Because if the boss doesn’t, then nobody can. Ask yourself at every moment, ‘Is this necessary?’ It means questioning that “open door” policy, or even where you live. We are afraid of being the bad guy who says, “Nope, not interested.” Chop wood, carry water. Don’t overanalyze. Do the work. That space between your ears - that’s yours. Control what gets in. Control what goes on in there. Protect it from yourself, from your own thoughts. Philosopher examines our impressions and thoughts to make sure we aren’t led astray by appearances or missing what couldn’t be seen by the naked eye. Do the kind of thinking that 99% of the population is just not doing. Stop doing the destructive thinking that they spend 99% of their time doing. journal/diary: Paper has more patience than people. John Cage 4′33″ was never about achieving perfect silence - it’s about what happens when you stop contributing to the noise. Wisdom is a sense of the big picture, the accumulation of experience and the ability to rise above the biases, the traps that catch lazier thinkers. Add experience and experimentation on top of this. Put yourself in tough situations. Accept challenges. Familiarize yourself with the unfamiliar. Egomaniacs are the least peaceful. Their mind is swirling in their own grandiosity and insecurity. They constantly bite off more than they can chew. Everything with them is complicated, everything is about them. Confidently embrace change. It's swapping an incorrect opinion for a correct one. It's not an admission of inferiority. Both egotistical and insecure people make their flaws central to their identity. The closer we get to mastery, the less we care about specific results. Mental stillness will be short-lived if our hearts are on fire, or our souls ache with emptiness. A virtuous life is worthwhile for its own sake. Form a moral code, or you'll have to belabor every decision and consider every temptation. What do you stand for? What do you believe to be essential and important? What are you really living for? Develop good character so when it counts, you will not flinch. So that when everyone else is scared and tempted, you will be virtuous. You will be still. Give more. Give what you didn’t get. Love more. Drop the old story. Ask when pulled by a strong desire: What will happen to me if I get what I want? How will I feel after? Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes which you are looking forward to were done. Would this be a great joy and happiness to you? No! (At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down.) Cultivate a poet’s eye - the ability to see beauty everywhere, even in the banal or the terrible. Nature is a cure-all, a comfort available to any and all who suffer. (Shinrin yoku: forest bathing.) Addiction is becoming obsessed with yourself and the primacy of your urges and thoughts. A life solely about work and doing is terribly out of balance. Love is the great educator. We learn when we give it. We learn when we get it. We get closer to stillness through it. Conservation of energy: Never stand up when you can sit down, and never sit down when you can lie down. So that you never shirk from a task, or back down from a challenge. So that you never burn yourself out or snuff out the spark of joy that makes life worth living. Churchill chose an unexpected form of leisure: bricklaying. Bricklaying didn’t wear down his body, it invigorated him. He loved the slow, methodical process. Find new activities that use other parts of your mind and body to relieve the areas where you are overworked. Have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. Every prophet is forced into the wilderness, where they undergo solitude, deprivation, reflection, and meditation. Psychic dynamite comes from this physical ordeal. Leave written works behind you. Be financially prudent and provide for the future. Cherish country living. Develop a reliable, disciplined routine. Movement through a beautiful setting can unlock a different kind of stillness than traditional meditation. A good routine is not only a source of great comfort and stability, it’s the platform from which stimulating and fulfilling work is possible. Repetition is a form of mesmerism. Mesmerize yourself to reach a deeper state of mind. Poet John Milton was up at 4 a.m. to read and contemplate, so that by 7 a.m. he was ready to be “milked” by his writing. Conflicting impulses, incentives, inclinations, and external interruptions are no path to stillness and not a way to get the best out of yourself. Automate and routinize the trivial parts of life, but also make automatic good and virtuous decisions, to free up resources to do important and meaningful exploration. Buy room for peace and stillness, and thus make good work and good thoughts accessible and inevitable. Limit the number of choices you need to make. The wealthy man has vast estates that lord over him rather than the other way around. The gentleman makes things his servants. The petty man is servant to things. Diogenes supposedly lived in a barrel and walked around nearly naked. When he saw a child drinking water from a well with his hands, Diogenes smashed his own cup, realizing that he had been carrying around an extraneous possession. Alexander the Great could neither tempt Diogenes with any favors nor deprive him of anything If a man can reduce his needs to zero, he is truly free. There is nothing that can be taken from him and nothing anyone can do to hurt him. Solitude allows you to reflect while others are reacting. Solitude is the school of genius. The crowded, busy world is the purgatory of the idiot. Solitude without purpose is a killer of creativity. Leisure is activity. What is absent is any external justification - you can’t do leisure for pay, you can’t do it to impress people. You have to do it for you. Let it relax you and give you peace. Find a pursuit that simultaneously challenges and relaxes you. To do leisure well, don't let it turn into a job. Stillness is not an excuse to withdraw from the affairs of the world. Quite the opposite - it’s a tool to let you do more good for more people.","Peaceful thoughts on inner tranquility and focus.  Great writer, solid ideas, I love this.  Read my notes for an idea, but definitely read the whole book."
Everything Is Fucked,Mark Manson,0062888439,8,"If life were as simple as learning to control one’s emotions and make decisions based on reason, then a lobotomized person should be an unstoppable badass, tirelessly industrious, and a ruthless decision maker. Lobotomies would be all the rage. Our emotions are instrumental in our decision making and our actions. We are moved to action only by emotion. Action is emotion. Anger pushes your body to move. Anxiety pulls it into retreat. Joy lights up the facial muscles. Sadness attempts to shade your existence from view. Emotion inspires action, and action inspires emotion. The two are inseparable. Why don’t we do things we know we should do? Because we don’t feel like it. Every problem of self-control is a problem of emotion. Emotional problems can only have emotional solutions. The Thinking Brain develops a tendency to draw maps explaining or justifying where the Feeling Brain has already decided it wants to go. The self-serving bias simply makes you prejudiced and a little bit self-centered. You assume that what feels right is right. It’s hard to pull someone out of the Clown Car once they’re in it. In the Clown Car, the Thinking Brain has been bullied and abused by the Feeling Brain for so long that it develops a sort of Stockholm syndrome - it can’t imagine a life beyond pleasing and justifying the Feeling Brain. It can’t fathom contradicting the Feeling Brain or challenging it on where it’s going, and it resents you for suggesting that it should. Cultish leaders always start by encouraging people to shut off their Thinking Brains as much as possible. Initially, this feels profound to people because the Thinking Brain is often correcting the Feeling Brain, showing it where it took a wrong turn. So, silencing the Thinking Brain will feel extremely good for a short period. People mistake what feels good for what is good. The person who denies his Feeling Brain numbs himself to the world. The person who denies his Thinking Brain becomes impulsive and selfish. Ever wonder why a page-turner is a page-turner? It’s your Feeling Brain turning those pages. Good writing is writing that is able to speak to and stimulate both brains at the same time. Let feelings out into the open where they can breathe, because the more they breathe, the weaker their grip is on the steering wheel. Appeal to your Feeling Brain in a way it understands: picture the benefits of some desired new behavior. Do not fight the Feeling Brain. You may not have self-control, but you get to control the meaning of your impulses and feelings. It’s the meaning that we ascribe to our feelings that can often alter how the Feeling Brain reacts to them. This is how you produce hope. Engage the Feeling Brain on its own terms. Create an environment that can bring about the Feeling Brain’s best impulses and intuition, rather than its worst. Accept and work with, rather than against, whatever the Feeling Brain spews at you. The Thinking Brain will have a better understanding of how to help the Feeling Brain navigate the road of life. This is emotional regulation. The drive to equalize (revenge / return to mean) is present in every experience and emotion itself. It is the operating system of the Feeling Brain. Thinking Brain makes lateral connections between events (sameness, contrasts, cause/effect) Feeling Brain makes hierarchical connections (better/worse, more desirable/less desirable, morally superior/morally inferior). Your value hierarchies change. An experience can completely rearranged your value hierarchy. One could predict your behavior solely from your value hierarchy. “Fun” is the product of a value hierarchy. When you stop valuing something, it ceases to be fun or interesting. When we lose our values, we grieve the death of those defining narratives because we have lost a part of ourselves. It is impossible to become someone new without first grieving the loss of who you used to be. To change your values, begin writing the narratives of your future self, to envision what life would be like if you had certain values or possessed a certain identity. By visualizing the future we want for ourselves, we allow our Feeling Brain to try on those values for size, to see what they feel like before we make the final purchase. Eventually, once we’ve done this enough, the Feeling Brain becomes accustomed to the new values and starts to believe them. We all mostly want the same things out of life. But those slight differences generate emotion, and emotion generates a sense of importance. Therefore, we come to perceive our differences as disproportionately more important than our similarities. The point of these false us-versus-them dichotomies is to cut off at the knees any reasoning or discussion before your followers start questioning their beliefs. Common enemies create unity within. Nietzsche: Amor fati = closing the separation between one’s desires and reality not by striving for more desires, but by simply desiring reality. It basically meant: hope for nothing. Hope for what already is. Don’t hope to eliminate your flaws. Let the Feeling Brain feel, but deny it the stories of meaning and value that it so desperately craves. The adolescent does the same stumbling around the young child does in learning what is pleasurable and what is painful. The adolescent stumbles around by trying on different social rules and roles. If I wear this, will it make me cool? If I talk like that, will it make people like me? Adulting: Preparing for job interviews, managing your finances, are rjle- and transaction-based. They are a means to some superficial end. The most important things in life cannot be gained through bargaining. Parents likely bargain with their kids for affection, love, or respect. They think this is normal, so the kid grows up thinking it’s normal. The only thing that distinguishes us from the rest of the matter in the universe is our ability to take the world around us and, through reasoning and will, improve upon it. We can actually direct existence. We are the only shot the universe has at intelligent self-organization. Kant: The most fundamental moral duty is the preservation and growth of consciousness. The Formula of Humanity: Act that you use humanity. Treat humanity never merely as a means, but always as an end itself. Lying is wrong because you are misleading another person’s conscious behavior in order to achieve your own goal. You are treating that person as a means to your own end. Honesty is good in and of itself because it’s the only form of communication that doesn’t treat people merely as a means. Courage is good in and of itself because to fail to act is to treat either yourself or others as a means to the end of quelling your fear. Humility is good in and of itself because to fall into blind certainty is to treat others as a means to your own ends. A single rule to describe all desirable human behavior: Treat humanity never merely as a means, but always as an end itself. No one is better or worse or more righteous than anyone else. All that matters is that conscious will is respected and protected. The only logical way to improve the world is through improving ourselves … by growing up and becoming more virtuous … by making the simple decision, in each moment, to treat ourselves and others as ends, and never merely as means. Be honest. Don’t distract or harm yourself. Don’t shirk responsibility or succumb to fear. Love openly and fearlessly. Don’t hope for a better life. Simply be a better life. There is a fundamental link between our respect for ourselves and our respect for the world. The values that define our identity are the templates that we apply to our interactions with others. Little progress can be made with others until we’ve made progress within ourselves. When we pursue a life full of pleasure and simple satisfaction, we are treating ourselves as a means to our pleasurable ends. Therefore, self-improvement is not the cultivation of greater happiness but, rather, a cultivation of greater self-respect. Telling ourselves that we are worthless and shitty is just as wrong as telling others that they are worthless and shitty. Lying to ourselves is just as unethical as lying to others. Harming ourselves is just as repugnant as harming others. Democracy assumes that the average person is selfish and delusional … that the only way to protect us from ourselves is to create systems so interdependent that no one person or group can completely hose the rest of the population. Democracy is the best system of government thus far because it’s the only system that openly admits that power attracts corrupt and childish people. Therefore, the only way to manage that is by enshrining adult virtues into the design of the system itself. The more we look for threats, the more we will see them, regardless of how safe or comfortable our environment actually is. The better things get, the more we perceive threats where there are none, and the more upset we become. This is the paradox of progress. Our minds amplify (or minimize) our problems to fit the degree of stress we expect to experience. A young person who has been sheltered from dealing with any challenges or injustices growing up will come to find the slightest inconveniences of adult life intolerable. By removing healthy adversity and challenge, people struggle even more. They become more selfish and more childish. They fail to develop and mature out of adolescence. They remain further removed from any virtue. Nobody is fully happy all the time, but nobody is fully unhappy all the time, either. Regardless of our external circumstances, we live in a constant state of mild-but-not-fully-satisfying happiness. Things are pretty much always fine, but they could also always be better. Our brain tells us, “You know, if I could just have a little bit more, I’d finally get to ten and stay there.” Most of us live much of our lives this way, constantly chasing our imagined ten. Trying to eliminate pain only increases your sensitivity to suffering, rather than alleviating your suffering. The mind can be fragile or antifragile depending on how you use it. When struck by chaos and disorder, our minds set to work making sense of it all, deducing principles and constructing mental models, predicting future events and evaluating the past. This is called “learning,” and it makes us better; it allows us to gain from failure and disorder. But when we avoid pain, when we avoid stress and chaos and tragedy and disorder, we become fragile. Our tolerance for day-to-day setbacks diminishes, and our life must shrink accordingly for us to engage only in the little bit of the world we can handle at one time. Will you engage your pain or avoid your pain? Everything is a reflection of this choice: your relationships your health your results at work your emotional stability your integrity your engagement with your community the breadth of your life experiences the depth of your self-confidence and courage your ability to respect and trust and forgive and appreciate and listen and learn and have compassion. If any of these things is fragile in your life, it is because you have chosen to avoid the pain. You have chosen childish values of chasing simple pleasures, desire, and self-satisfaction. Death is psychologically necessary because it creates stakes in life. There is something to lose. You don’t know what something is worth until you experience the potential to lose it. The quality of our character is determined by our relationship to our pain. Pain is the source of all value. The only freedom is self-limitation. Choosing what you will give up. Self-denial is paradoxically the only thing that expands real freedom. The pain of regular physical exercise ultimately enhances your physical freedom - your strength. The most meaningful freedom comes from your commitments, the things in life for which you have chosen to sacrifice. There is emotional freedom in my relationship with my wife. There is freedom in having lived in one place for fifty years - an intimacy and familiarity with the community and culture - that you cannot replicate no matter how much of the world you’ve seen. Life hacking: trying to reap the rewards of commitment without actually making a commitment. Empty calories for the soul. We are a self-hating, self-destructive species. Adapt our technology for our flawed psychology rather than to exploit it. Create tools that promote greater character and maturity. Enshrine the virtues of autonomy, liberty, privacy, and dignity in our business models and our social lives. Create tools to help our Thinking Brain better communicate and manage the Feeling Brain, and to bring them into alignment. Technology can counterbalance our psychological fragility. Idea: independent, third-party algorithms that rate the veracity of headlines, websites, and news stories in real time, allowing users to more quickly sift through the propaganda-laden garbage and get closer to evidence-based truth.","Philosophy made relatable. Great points about taking feelings seriously, pain as the speed of light, humanity as an ends not means, and democracy acknowledging human nature. Sections on Nietzsche and Kant are fascinating, not academic. The second half grabbed me the most."
Stubborn Attachments,Tyler Cowen,1732265135,8,"When we condemn a man who beats his wife, must we really calculate whether the suffering of the victim exceeds the pleasure of the hitter? If individuals are poorly informed, confused, or downright inconsistent - as nearly all of us are, at times - the notion of “what we want” isn’t always so clear. Be skeptical about the powers of the individual human mind. When we decide whether and when to break a given rule, we’re back to judging individual cases, which is what rules were supposed to get us away from in the first place. The Crusonia plant: a mythical, automatically growing crop which generates more output each period. If you lay the seeds, the plant just grows. A Crusonia plant would be more desirable than a plant that dies after a month and leaves no successors, even if this short-lived plant were quite lovely or brilliant. The unceasing free yield of the Crusonia plant has to prove the better choice. The ongoing growth of the Crusonia plant dominates the comparison. A principle of both ethics and prudence: when in doubt, choose the Crusonia plant. When it comes to making tough decisions, try to identify which elements in the choice set resemble a Crusonia plant. If we can identify certain choices or policies that give rise to the equivalent of the Crusonia plant’s unceasing yield, namely ongoing and self-sustaining surges in value, the case for those choices would be compelling. Social processes which are ongoing, self-sustaining, and which create rising value over time. GDP statistics have a bias toward what can be measured easily and relatively precisely, rather than focusing on what contributes to human welfare. “Wealth Plus”: The total amount of value produced over a certain time period. This includes the traditional measures of economic value found in GDP statistics, but also includes measures of leisure time, household production, and environmental amenities, as summed up in a relevant measure of wealth. A database on civilizational survival that catalogues sixty civilizations shows the average civilization endured for 402.6 years. Decline comes more rapidly over time. Since the collapse of the Roman Empire, the average duration of a civilization has been only 304.5 years. Human beings can and indeed do experience significant and ongoing losses of their prosperity and freedom. Our positive opportunities in life often matter more than the amount of cash in our bank accounts. If you ask the people of Kenya how happy they are with their health, you’ll get a pretty high rate of reported satisfaction, not so different from the rate in the healthier countries, and in fact higher than the reported rate of satisfaction in the United States. The correct conclusion is not that Kenyan hospitals possess hidden virtues or that malaria is absent in Kenya, but rather that Kenyans have recalibrated their use of language to reflect what they can reasonably expect from their daily experiences. In similar fashion, people in less happy situations or less happy societies often attach less ambitious meanings to the claim that they are happy. Evidence based on questionnaires will therefore underrate the happiness of people in wealthier countries. A fast-food cheeseburger is not actually worth $4.89, considering its potential impact on my future health. The cheeseburger offer is manipulating my evolutionarily programmed desire for more fat, to the detriment of my life expectancy. Yet at the same time, living in a much wealthier society - even one rife with fast food - is still good for most people, including good for their health. Derek Parfit’s “Mistakes in Moral Mathematics”: If a firing squad of six shooters kills an innocent person, all of them firing accurately at his heart, can we say that any one of the shooters is a murderer? After all, the “marginal product” of any single shooter was zero. Should we punish or invest resources into preventing the actions of any one of the shooters? Does it matter whose bullet arrived first? The marksman example is stylized, but it fits many real-world situations. Maybe a single act of corruption has no harmful effects, but corruption in general is harmful, and many corrupt acts will destroy a polity. Would we be justified in condemning a single act of corruption with a fair degree of strictness and severity, without worrying too much about whether the single act of corruption is really going to matter in the long run? Numerous violations of the rule or law may seem harmless enough, but enough of them can be dire once we consider the longer-run expectation and incentive effects. Some rules, such as “never lie,” face embarrassing counterexamples if lying can bring about significant practical benefits in particular instances. But a rule of “maximize the rate of sustainable economic growth” does not face a comparable problem. By definition, the rule is telling us to follow outcomes with a preponderance of benefits over costs. When they are given a choice between the immediate present, the future, and the more distant future. Very often they are biased toward the immediate present. For instance, a person might realize that a benefit in two years’ time is about the same in value as that same benefit in three years’ time. That’s a rational posture. That same person, however, may prefer a dollar today to three dollars three weeks from now. But when the comparison is between ten years from now and twenty years from now, people exhibit much more patience, and many people would even say that a benefit ten years from now is about as valuable as the same benefit twenty years from now. In other words, individual time preference usually focuses on the immediate vs. the only somewhat distant. If we can get over our initial impatience for receiving a reward now, our intellect is very often capable of seeing that we should care about the more distant future as much as we should care about the less distant future. For the most part, we’re actually fairly rational about time, except for this fixation on the “now” moment and the “very soon/right away” horizon. Human beings evolved under brutal hunter-gatherer conditions; they had good reason to pay special attention to the now moment. If you didn’t get the “now” right, there might not be a tomorrow. If you let a piece of meat sit, it would spoil or be seized by your neighbor or consumed by marauding animals overnight. So we may have an innate biological preference for the “now,” but we will do better if we can get past it, if we can tap into the part of ourselves that recognizes that a benefit in twenty years’ time is about as valuable as that same benefit in thirty years’ time. Markets do not reflect the preferences of currently unborn individuals. If we were to imagine future generations engaging in such contracting, current decisions might run more in their favor. Political and economic decisions, and the general existence of prosperity, have persistent effects that stretch for centuries into the future. Colonial policies from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have persistent effects on prosperity today. Good institutions and a history of prosperity tend to have enduring effects. Wealth can fund and enable better government, and that in turn gives rise to further wealth and better institutions. Institutional memories of economic success and good governance can persist for long periods of time. Cultural practices such as business savvy or an interest in external markets can last for centuries. One approach to restitution problems applies a standard rate of positive discount to the previous costs to convert them into a present value. Let’s say the discount rate is seven percent. If my ancestor stole a thousand dollars from your ancestor back in the year 1854, I should have to pay you seven percent compounded for each year between 1854 and 2018. Presumably that would undo this harm or rectify the injustice. But if you do the math, that amounts to more than $65 million. Most of us should work hard, be creative, be loyal to our civilization, build healthy institutions, save for the future, contribute to an atmosphere of social trust, be critical when necessary, and love our families. Our strongest obligations are to contribute to sustainable economic growth and to support the general spread of civilization, rather than to engage in massive charitable redistribution in the narrower sense. In the longer run, what will help the poor most of all is greater economic growth and a more stable civilization. We should redistribute wealth only up to the point that it maximizes the rate of sustainable economic growth. Rather than redistributing most wealth, we can do better for the world by investing in high-return activities like supporting immigration and producing new technologies with global reach. Non-infrastructure government spending is correlated positively with lower growth rates. Be skeptical of ideologues who claim to know all of the relevant paths to making ours a better world. How can we be sure that a favored ideology will in fact bring about good consequences? Given the radical uncertainty of the more distant future, we can’t know how to achieve preferred goals with any kind of certainty over longer time horizons. Our attachment to particular means should therefore be highly tentative, highly uncertain. How confident should you really be about the details of your political beliefs? How firm should your dogmatism be about means-ends? Not very; better to adopt a tolerant demeanor and really mean it. As a general rule, we should not pat ourselves on the back and feel that we are on the correct side of an issue. We are still more likely to be wrong than right. Our particular views, in politics and elsewhere, should be no more certain than our assessments of which team will win the World Series. With this attitude political posturing loses much of its fun, and indeed it ought to be viewed as disreputable or perhaps even as a sign of our own overconfident and delusional nature. Radical uncertainty gives us the freedom to act morally, without the fear that we are engaging in consequentialist destruction. Our actions will have consequences we cannot possibly predict. We do not have the “Best Ethical Theory,” as a philosopher might wish to derive, but rather some good decision-making rules to live by, as well as some standards for how we might imagine a much brighter future. Political competition within relatively short electoral cycles relative to the time horizons over which policy matters. (The U.S. House of Representatives has a two-year voting cycle for policies which may have effects over twenty or thirty years, or, in the case of environmental policies, longer still.) Derek Parfit’s repugnant conclusion compares two population scenarios: The first outcome has a very large, very fulfilled, and very happy population. The world also has many ideal goods, such as beauty, virtue, and justice. The second outcome has a much larger population but few, if any, ideal goods. A world of “Muzak and potatoes.” The lives in this scenario are still worth living, although perhaps by only the tiniest of margins. If the population of the second scenario is large enough, the second scenario could welfare-dominate the first. No matter how good we make the first world, quantity can weigh in on the side of the second. Why should we choose flourishing and more complex human lives over a larger number of slightly happy animal lives? Might we not consider voluntarily extinguishing the human race to make more room for a greater number of non-human animals? Very small utilities, no matter how large in number, ought not to add up to something with great moral significance.","Subtitle “A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals” gives a hint of its contents. I love these kinds of books: full of well-considered, smart, rational and surprising ideas from an economist."
The Consolations of Philosophy,Alain De Botton,0679779175,8,"Socrates' confidence was not from courage. It had been grounded in philosophy. Philosophy supplied Socrates with convictions in which he had been able to have rational, as opposed to hysterical, confidence when faced with disapproval. Questioning conventions seems bizarre, even aggressive. Conventions' judgements are deemed plainly too sensible to be the targets of scrutiny. It seems implausible that our society could be gravely mistaken in its beliefs and at the same time that we would be alone in noticing the fact. We stifle our doubts and follow the flock because we cannot conceive of ourselves as pioneers of hitherto unknown, difficult truths. Our will to doubt can be just as powerfully sapped by an internal sense that societal conventions must have a sound basis, even if we are not sure exactly what this may be, because they have been adhered to by a great many people for a long time. People may be wrong even when they are espousing beliefs held for centuries by vast majorities. Look at Greece in the fifth century BC: They believed in many gods, sacrificed animals, owned one slave to every three of the free population. Women were unable either to inherit property or to own money. A wealthy man can be admirable, but this depends on how wealth was acquired. Just as poverty can not by itself reveal anything of the moral worth of an individual. Examine beliefs logically. A correct statement is one incapable of being rationally contradicted. A statement is true if it cannot be disproved. Locate a statement confidently described as common sense. Search for situations where the statement would not be true. If found, the definition must be false or at least imprecise. The initial statement must be nuanced to take the exception into account. The product of thought is superior to the product of intuition. We acquire a misplaced respect for others when we concentrate solely on their conclusions – which is why Socrates urged us to dwell on the logic they used to reach them. One shouldn’t respect all human opinions, but only those of people with understanding. The validity of an idea or action is determined not by whether it is widely believed or widely reviled but by whether it obeys the rules of logic. We seek doctors because they understand bodily maladies better than we can. We should turn to philosophers for the same reason when our soul is unwell. It's senseless to alarm yourself in advance about death - a state which you will never experience. There is nothing terrible in not living. Recipe book: 1. Identify a project for happiness: In order to be happy on holiday, I must live in a villa. 2. Imagine that the project may be false. Look for exceptions to the supposed link between the desired object and happiness. Could one possess the desired object but not be happy? Could one be happy but not have the desired object? Could I spend money on a villa and still not be happy? Could I be happy on holiday and not spend as much money as on a villa? 3. If an exception is found, the desired object cannot be a necessary and sufficient cause of happiness. It is possible to have a miserable time in a villa if I feel friendless and isolated. It is possible for me to be happy in a tent if I am with someone I love and feel appreciated by. 4. In order to be accurate about producing happiness, the initial project must be nuanced to take the exception into account. In so far as I can be happy in an expensive villa, this depends on being with someone I love and feel appreciated by. I can be happy without spending money on a villa, as long as I am with someone I love and feel appreciated by. 5. True needs may now seem very different from the confused initial desire. Happiness depends more on the possession of a congenial companion than a well-decorated villa. Expensive objects can feel like plausible solutions to needs we don’t understand. Wealth beyond what is natural is of no more use than water to a container that is overflowing. Businesses stimulate unnecessary desires in people who fail to understand their true needs. Choice: * societies which stimulate unnecessary desires but achieve enormous economic strengths as a result * societies which would provide for essential material needs but could never raise living standards beyond subsistence, no technological advances, and little incentive to trade with distant continents. It is this discontent that has driven life steadily onward, out to the high seas. The only way to evaluate their merits is according to the pleasure they inspire. Avoid superiors, patronization, infighting, and competition. Philosophy helps us overcome conflicts between wishes and reality. Attain wisdom by learning not to aggravate the world’s obstinacy through our own responses, through spasms of rage, self-pity, anxiety, bitterness, self-righteousness and paranoia. We best endure those frustrations which we have prepared ourselves for and understand, and are hurt most by those we least expected. Anger results not from an uncontrollable eruption of the passions, but from a basic (and correctable) error of reasoning. Because we are injured most by what we do not expect, we must expect everything. Assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen. They believed there was somewhere on earth where they might be wholly safe. It's dangerous innocence. The expectation of a future formed on the basis of probability, however rare, is a possibility we must ready ourselves for. Fortune did not evaluate her victims. Reassurance can be the cruellest antidote to anxiety. Bad things probably will occur, but they are unlikely ever to be as bad as we fear. There would be few great human achievements if we accepted all frustrations. What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears. Everything is too complicated for men to be able to understand. Misplaced confidence in reason is the well-spring of idiocy. A friend is someone kind enough to consider more of us normal than most people do. Only that which makes us feel better may be worth understanding. We prefer to quote rather than speak and think for ourselves - to be immune from the most cruel attacks that can befall original works - to not be held responsible for the ideas. I am valued the more the farther from home knowledge of me has spread. Few men have been wonders to their families. We are educated to associate virtue with submission to textual authorities, rather than with an exploration within ourselves. We can derive greater insights from ourselves than from all the books of old. Whoever recalls to mind his last bout of anger sees the ugliness of this passion better than in Aristotle. Eradicate from our minds the erroneous notion that the world has a great deal to offer us. Readers not only recognized themselves, they also understood themselves better as a result, for Goethe had clarified moments that his readers would previously have lived through, though would not necessarily have fathomed. Direct our aim not to what is pleasant and agreeable in life, but to the avoidance, as far as possible, of its numberless evils. The happiest lot is that of the man who has got through life without any very great pain, bodily or mental. Fulfilment was to be reached not by avoiding pain, but by recognizing its role as a natural, inevitable step on the way to reaching anything good. Goethe: These four men were perhaps the richest clues for what Nietzsche came in his maturity to understand by a fulfilled life. They had much in common. They were curious, artistically gifted, and sexually vigorous. Despite their dark sides, they laughed, and many of them danced, too; they were drawn to ‘gentle sunlight, bright and buoyant air, southerly vegetation, the breath of the sea [and] fleeting meals of flesh, fruit and eggs’. Several of them had a gallows humour close to Nietzsche’s own – a joyful, wicked laughter arising from pessimistic hinterlands. They had explored their possibilities, they possessed what Nietzsche called ‘life’, which suggested courage, ambition, dignity, strength of character, humour and independence (and a parallel absence of sanctimoniousness, conformity, resentment and prissiness). How can anyone become a thinker if he does not spend at least a third of the day without passions, people and books? Happiness can not be attained painlessly. Timid slaves in the Roman Empire lacked the stomach to climb to the tops of mountains, so built themselves a philosophy claiming that their bases were delightful. They wished to enjoy the real ingredients of fulfilment but did not have the courage to endure the difficulties these goods demanded. We profess indifference to what we secretly long for but do not have.","How can the lessons of philosophers change your life?

Story of Philosophy,Will Durant,0671739166,8,"The love of a modestly elusive Truth seemed incomparably more glorious than the lust for the flesh. We believe there is something vital and significant in us, if only we could decipher our own souls. Those who don’t want millions, but an answer to their questions: we want to seize the value and perspective of passing things, to pull ourselves up out of the maelstrom of daily circumstance. We want to coordinate our energies by criticizing and harmonizing our desires. Some philosophers have had all sorts of wisdom except common sense. Many a philosophic flight has been due to the elevating power of thin air. Science seems always to advance, while philosophy seems always to lose ground. Yet this is only because philosophy deals with problems not yet open to the methods of science. As soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible of exact formulation it is called science. Philosophy seems to stand still, perplexed; but only because she leaves the fruits of victory to her daughters the sciences, and herself passes on, divinely discontent, to the uncertain and unexplored. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. The philosopher wishes to ascertain the relation to experience in general, and thereby to get at its meaning and its worth. He combines things in interpretive synthesis. He tries to put together, better than before, that great universe-watch which the inquisitive scientist has analytically taken apart. A fact is not complete except in relation to a purpose and a whole. When genius speaks to us we feel a ghostly reminiscence of having ourselves, in our distant youth, had vaguely this self-same thought which genius now speaks, but which we had not art or courage to clothe with form and utterance. Multi-cultural cities: Traditions and dogmas rub one another down to a minimum in such centers of varied intercourse. Where there are a thousand faiths we are apt to become sceptical of them all. Wealth brought the leisure and security which are the prerequisite of research and speculation. He could drink like a gentleman - without fear and without excess. He did not claim to have wisdom, but only to seek it lovingly; he was wisdom’s amateur, not its professional. Philosophy begins when one learns to doubt one’s cherished beliefs. Plato says human behavior flows from desire, emotion, and knowledge. Desire: restless and acquisitive souls, who are absorbed in material quests and quarrels, who burn with lust of luxuries and show, and who rate their gains always as naught compared with their ever-receding goals. Emotion: temples of feeling and courage, who care not so much what they fight for, as for victory “in and for itself”. Their pride is in power rather than in possession. Knowledge: the few whose delight is in meditation and understanding; who yearn not for goods, nor for victory, but for knowledge; who leave both market and battle-field to lose themselves in the quiet clarity of secluded thought; whose will is a light rather than a fire, whose haven is not power but truth: these are the men of wisdom, who stand aside unused by the world. People need the guidance of philosophers, as desires need the enlightenment of knowledge. Only a philosopher-king is fit to guide a nation. This is the key-stone of Plato’s thought. They were taught philosophy the age of thirty. It would not have been wise to let them taste the dear delight too early; for young men, when they first get the taste of philosophy in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and refuting, like puppy-dogs who delight to tear and pull at all who come near them. Life in society requires the concession of some part of the individual’s sovereignty to the common order; and ultimately the norm of conduct becomes the welfare of the group. Aristotle violated his own canons plentifully; but then he was the product of his past, and not of that future which his thought would build. Every important term in serious discourse shall be subjected to strictest scrutiny and definition. It is difficult, and ruthlessly tests the mind; but once done it is half of any task. Aristotle concerned himself with the objective present, while Plato is absorbed in a subjective future. Socrates gave philosophy to mankind, and Aristotle gave it science. A guide to correct reasoning is as elevating as a manual of etiquette; we may use it, but it hardly spurs us to nobility. Where there is no strife there is decay: the mixture which is not shaken decomposes. Excellence will depend on clear judgment, self-control, symmetry of desire, artistry of means. It is the middle way, the golden mean. The qualities of character can be arranged in triads, in each of which the first and last qualities will be extremes and vices, and the middle quality a virtue or an excellence. So between cowardice and rashness is courage between stinginess and extravagance is liberality between sloth and greed is ambition between humility and pride is modesty between secrecy and loquacity, honesty between moroseness and buffoonery, good humor between quarrelsomeness and flattery, friendship between Hamlet’s indecisiveness and Quixote’s impulsiveness is self-control. It is not an exact average - it discovers itself only to mature and flexible reason. Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have these because we have acted rightly. These virtues are formed in man by his doing the actions. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. Youth is the age of extremes. Fault is always on the side of excess and exaggeration. Get out of one extreme without falling into its opposite. For one extreme easily passes into the other. The man in the middle position; the brave man is called rash by the coward, and cowardly by the rash man. Friendship is more necessary to the happy than to the unhappy. Our philosophy is where our treasure lies. If men think that a ruler is religious and reveres the gods, they are less afraid of suffering injustice at his hands, and are less disposed to conspire against him, since they believe that the gods themselves are fighting on his side. Democracy: The user of a house will be a better judge of it than the builder, and the guest will be a better judge of a feast than the cook. The many are more incorruptible than the few. The Greek mind lacked limiting and steadying traditions; it moved freely in an uncharted field, and ran too readily to theories and conclusions. So Greek philosophy leaped on to heights unreached again, while Greek science limped behind. As knowledge grew, fear decreased; men thought less of worshiping the unknown, and more of overcoming it. No man could fail to flourish in such a time and country, if there was seed in him at all. It is difficult to be either master or servant if one is sensitive. In love, it does not do to give one’s self wholly; one should at all times give, but at no time all. Gratitude is nourished with expectation. Knowledge unapplied in action is a pale academic vanity. Crafty men condemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them; for the end of scholasticism culminates in pragmatism. Are not the pleasures of the affections greater than the pleasures of the senses, and are not the pleasures of the intellect greater than the pleasures of the affections? Francis Bacon Essays (1597–1623): among the few books that deserve to be chewed and digested. Each of these essays gives in a page or two the distilled subtlety of a master mind on a major issue of life. Nothing could be so injurious to health as the Stoic repression of desire; what is the use of prolonging a life which apathy has turned into premature death? Nature is often hidden; sometimes overcome; seldom extinguished. Let not a man trust his victory over his nature too far. Italians have an ungracious proverb: “Tanto buon che val niente” : so good that he is good for nothing. Declare what men do in fact, and not what they ought to do. Want a full and varied career, giving acquaintance with everything that can broaden, deepen, strengthen or sharpen the mind. A principal fruit of friendship is the ease and discharge of the fullness and swellings of the heart, which passions of all kinds do cause and induce. Whoever hath his mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits and understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and discoursing with another; he tosseth his thoughts more easily; he marshaleth them more orderly; he seeth how they look when they are turned into words; finally he waxeth wiser than himself; and that more by one hour’s discourse than by a day’s meditation. Young men embrace more than they can hold, stir more than they can quiet. Men of age object too much, consult too long, adventure too little, and content themselves with a mediocrity of success. The virtues of either may correct the defects of both. As no perfect view of a country can be taken from a flat; so it is impossible to discover the remote and deep parts of any science by standing upon the level of the same science, or without ascending to a higher. Government suffers, precisely like science, for lack of philosophy. Philosophy bears movement guided by total knowledge and perspective, as against aimless and individual seeking. The rational sciences are the keys to all the rest. Whatever your mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion. More care is to be taken in dealing with such questions, to keep the understanding even and clear. It must not be supplied with wings, but rather hung with weights to keep it from leaping and flying. Truth knows no parties. He had the northern hunger for truth rather than the southern lust for beauty. Humility is either the hypocrisy of a schemer or the timidity of a slave; it implies the absence of power. All virtues are forms of ability and power. To hate is to acknowledge our inferiority and our fear; we do not hate a foe whom we are confident we can overcome. Thought should not lack the heat of desire, nor desire the light of thought. In the end there is no virtue but intelligence. Voltaire carried on the antiseptic scepticism of Montaigne. His later educators, the Jesuits, gave him the very instrument of scepticism by teaching him dialectic - the art of proving anything, and therefore at last the habit of believing nothing. History proves that anything can be proved by history. Only charlatans are certain. Even if Philosophy should end in the total doubt of Montaigne’s “Que sais-je?” it is man’s greatest adventure, and his noblest. To unite the ideas of Berkeley and Hume with the feelings of Rousseau, to save religion from reason, and yet at the same time to save science from scepticism - this was the mission of Immanuel Kant. Sensations and thoughts await our call, they do not come unless we need them. We shall never find a straight line that is not the shortest distance between two points. Mathematics, at least, is saved from scepticism. We must avoid behavior which, if adopted by all men, would render social life impossible. I must not lie, even if it be to my advantage. An action is good not because it has good results, or because it is wise, but because it is done in obedience to this inner sense of duty. The only thing unqualifiedly good in this world is a good will - the will to follow the moral law, regardless of profit or loss for ourselves. Never mind your happiness; do your duty. Ask not how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness. Let us seek perfection - whether it bring us happiness or pain. When mere creeds or ceremonies usurp priority over moral excellence as a test of religion, religion has disappeared. We can think of something only by relating it to something else, and perceiving its similarities and its differences. An idea without relations of any kind is empty. Every idea and every situation in the world leads irresistibly to its opposite, and then unites with it to form a higher or more complex whole. Struggle is growth; character is built in the storm and stress of the world; Pain is a sign of life and a stimulus to reconstruction. Life is not made for happiness, but for achievement. Periods of happiness are blank pages in history. Schopenhauer: Like a sensible pessimist, he had avoided that pitfall of optimists - the attempt to make a living with the pen. The intellect may seem at times to lead the will, but only as a guide leads his master; the will is the strong blind man who carries on his shoulders the lame man who can see. We do not want a thing because we have found reasons for it, we find reasons for it because we want it; we even elaborate philosophies and theologies to cloak our desires. A good will is more reliable than a clear mind. Brilliant qualities of mind win admiration, but never affection. Everyone believes himself to be perfectly free, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life, which just means that he can become another person. But through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free; that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct. Nothing is so fatal to an ideal as its realization. Fulfilment never satisfies. We are unhappy married, and unmarried we are unhappy. We are unhappy when alone, and unhappy in society. Everything else can satisfy only one wish; money alone is absolutely good because it is the abstract satisfaction of every wish. The more we know of our passions, the less they control us. The greatest is not the conqueror of the world, but the subduer of himself. To discipline one’s self - that is the highest thing. It is dangerous to read about a subject before we have thought about it ourselves. When we read, another person thinks for us; we merely repeat his mental process. If anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking. Aristotle says, “To be happy means to be self-sufficient.” Genius is renouncing one’s own personality for a time, so as to remain pure knowing subject. There is, of course, a large element of egotism in pessimism: the world is not good enough for us. When the romanticist discovers that his ideal of happiness works out into actual unhappiness, he does not blame his ideal. He simply assumes that the world is unworthy of a being so exquisitely organized as himself. Pleasure is the harmonious operation of our instincts. Thought without action is a disease. He became cynical, like one who had staked all on a single throw of the dice, and had lost. Bring about not the betterment of the majority, who, taken as individuals, are the most worthless types, but the creation of genius, the development and elevation of superior personalities. The very last thing a sensible man would undertake would be to improve mankind: mankind does not improve, it does not even exist - it is an abstraction; all that exists is a vast ant-hill of individuals. Society is an instrument for the enhancement of the power and personality of the individual; the group is not an end in itself. The man who does not wish to be merely one of the mass only needs to cease to be easy on himself. Nature abhors equality, it loves differentiation of individuals and classes and species. Socialism is anti-biological.","Profiles of some top philosophers: Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, Voltaire, Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche. But wow - Durant’s writing steals the show. A hundred various thoughts to digest."
Innumeracy,John Allen Paulos,0809058405,8,"Estimate: * how fast human hair grows in miles per hour * approximately how many people die on earth each day * how many cigarettes are smoked annually in this country * what the population of the United States is * the approximate distance from coast to coast * what percentage of the world is Chinese * How many pizzas are consumed each year in the United States? * How many words have you spoken in your life? * How many different people’s names appear in The New York Times each year? * How many watermelons would fit inside the U.S. Capitol building? * How long would it take dump trucks to cart away Mount Fuji, to ground level? Assume trucks come every fifteen minutes, twenty-four hours a day, are instantaneously filled with mountain dirt and rock, and leave without getting in each other’s way. Practice estimating whatever quantity piques your curiosity. Information can be gleaned from the barest numerical facts, and claims can often be refuted on the basis of these raw numbers alone. To get a handle on big numbers, it’s useful to come up with one or two collections corresponding to each power of ten, up to maybe 13 or 14. Taking a human being to be spherical and about a meter in diameter: * The size of a human cell is to that of a person as a person’s size is to that of Rhode Island. * A virus is to a person as a person is to the earth * An atom is to a person as a person is to the earth’s orbit around the sun * A proton is to a person as a person is to the distance to Alpha Centauri. Genesis says of the Flood that “… all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered…” Taken literally, this seems to indicate that there were 10,000 to 20,000 feet of water on the surface of the earth, equivalent to more than half a billion cubic miles of liquid! Since, according to biblical accounts, it rained for forty days and forty nights, or for only 960 hours, the rain must have fallen at a rate of at least fifteen feet per hour, certainly enough to sink any aircraft carrier. The multiplication principle is deceptively simple and very important: If some choice can be made in M different ways and some subsequent choice can be made in N different ways, then there are M × N different ways these choices can be made in succession. The number of possible license plates in a state whose plates all have two letters followed by four numbers is 262 × 104. People don’t generally appreciate how large such seemingly tidy collections can be. 31 different flavors of ice cream? The number of possible triple-scoop cones without any repetition of flavors is therefore 31 × 30 × 29 If we’re not interested in how the flavors are arranged on the cone but merely in how many three-flavored cones there are, we divide 26,970 by 6, to get 4,495 cones. The reason we divide by 6 is that there are 6 = 3 × 2 × 1 different ways to arrange the three flavors Lotteries choose six numbers out of a possible forty. (40 × 39 × 38 × 37 × 36 × 35) If, however, we are interested not in the order then we divide by 720, since there are 720 (= 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) ways to arrange the six numbers Same in all three examples: (32 × 30 × 29)/(3 × 2 × 1) different three-flavored ice-cream cones (40 × 39 × 38 × 37 × 36 × 35)/(6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) different ways to choose six numbers out of forty (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) different poker hands. Numbers obtained in this way are called combinatorial coefficients. They arise when we’re interested in the number of ways of choosing R elements out of N elements and we’re not interested in the order of the R elements chosen. To calculate probabilities: If two events are independent in the sense that the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of the other, then the probability that they both occur is computed by multiplying the probabilities of the individual events. The probability of obtaining two heads in two flips of a coin is ½ × ½ = ¼ since the probability of five straight coin flips resulting in heads is (½)⁵ = 1⁄32. The probability that an event doesn’t occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that it does (a 20 percent chance of rain implies an 80 percent chance of no rain). (5⁄6)⁴ is the probability of not rolling a 6 in four rolls of the die. Hence, subtracting this number from 1 gives us the probability that this latter event (no 6s) doesn’t occur or, in other words, of there being at least one 6 rolled in the four tries: 1 – (5⁄6)⁴ = .52. Likewise, the probability of rolling at least one 12 in twenty-four rolls of a pair of dice is seen to be 1 – (35⁄36)²⁴ = .49. Binomial probability distribution arises whenever a procedure or trial may result in “success” or “failure” and one is interested in the probability of obtaining R successes in N trials. Half of the time that twenty-three randomly selected people are gathered together, two or more of them will share a birthday. By dividing this latter product (365 × 364 × 363 × 362 × 361) by 3655, we get the probability that five people chosen at random will have no birthday in common. Now, if we subtract this probability from 1, we get the complementary probability that at least two of the five people do have a birthday in common. A similar calculation using 23 rather than 5 yields ½, or 50 percent, as the probability that at least two of twenty-three people will have a common birthday. It would be very unlikely for unlikely events not to occur. If you don’t specify a predicted event precisely, there are an indeterminate number of ways for an event of that general kind to take place. The average value of a large collection of measurements is about the same as the average value of a small collection, whereas the extreme value of a large collection is considerably more extreme than that of a small collection. The average scientist in tiny Belgium will be comparable to the average scientist in the United States, even though the best scientist in the United States will in general be better than Belgium’s best. The expected value of a quantity is simply the average of its values weighted according to their probabilities. For example: If ... * 1/4 of the time a quantity equals 2 * 1/3 of the time it equals 6 * 1/3 of the time it equals 15 * remaining 1⁄12 of the time it equals 54 ... then its expected value equals 12. This is so since [12 = (2 × 1/4) + (6 × 1⁄3) + (15 × 1⁄3) + (54 × 1⁄12)]. Consider a home-insurance company: On average, each year... * one out of every 10,000 of its policies will result in a claim of $200,000 * one out of 1,000 policies will result in a claim of $50,000 * one out of 50 will result in a claim of $2,000 * the remainder will result in a claim of $0. The insurance company would like to know what its average payout is per policy written. The answer is the expected value, which in this case is ($200,000 × 1/10,000) + ($50,000 × 1/1,000) + ($2,000 × 1/50) + ($0 × 9,789/10,000) = $20 + $50 + $40 = $110. Chuck-a-luck: You pick a number from 1 to 6 and the operator rolls three dice. If the number you pick comes up on all three dice, the operator pays you $3 if it comes up on two of the three dice, he pays you $2 if it comes up on just one of the three dice, he pays you $1. Only if the number you picked doesn’t come up at all do you pay him anything - just $1. Say you pick the number 4. Chances that a 4 will come up on all three dice? = 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 = 1⁄216; so, approximately 1/216th Chances of a 4 coming up only twice? = Use the binomial probability distribution: X44, 4X4, or 44X, the X indicating a non-4. The probability of the first is 5⁄6 × 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 = 5⁄216, the probability of a 4 coming up on two of the three dice is 15⁄216, probability of obtaining exactly one 4 among 4XX is 1⁄6 × 5⁄6 × 5⁄6 = 25⁄216, Adding, we get 75⁄216. Chances that no 4s come up when we roll three dice? = find how much probability is left over. Subtract (1⁄216 + 15⁄216 + 75⁄216) from 1 The expected value of your winnings is thus: ($3 × 1⁄216) + ($2 × 15⁄216) + ($1 × 75⁄216) + (–$1 × 125⁄216) = $(–17⁄216) = – $.08 And so, on average, you would lose approximately eight cents every time you played this seemingly attractive game. Gambler’s fallacy is the mistaken belief that because a coin has come up heads several times in a row, it’s more likely to come up tails on its next flip. Peter and Paul, who flip a coin at the rate of once a day and who bet on heads and tails respectively. Whoever is ahead will probably have been ahead almost the whole time. If Peter is ahead at the end, it’s considerably more likely that he’s been ahead more than 96 percent of the time than that he’s been ahead between 48 percent and 52 percent of the time. It can take a long, long time for the lead to switch. The number of accidents each year at a certain intersection, the number of rainstorms per year in a given desert, the number of cases of leukemia in a specified county, have all been described quite accurately by the so-called Poisson probability distribution. It’s necessary first to know roughly how rare the event is. But if you do know, you can use this information along with the Poisson formula to get a quite accurate idea of the percentage of years in which there would be no desert rainstorms, one such storm, two storms, three, and so on. In this sense, even very rare events are quite predictable. Assume the probability to be one out of 10,000 that a particular dream matches in a few vivid details some sequence of events in real life. Since (9,999/10,000)365 is about .964, we can conclude that about 96.4 percent of the people who dream every night will have only nonmatching dreams during a one-year span. But that means that about 3.6 percent of the people who dream every night will have a predictive dream. Incredible coincidences, whose probability, let’s say, is estimated to be one in a trillion (1 divided by 1012, or 10−12). Should we be impressed? Not necessarily. Since by the multiplication principle there are (2.5 × 108 × 2.5 × 108)/2 or 3.13 × 1016 different pairs of people in the United States, and since we’re assuming the probability of this collection of coincidences to be about 10−12, the average number of “incredible” linkages we can expect is 3.13 × 1016 times 10−12, or about 30,000. Astrology: The gravitational pull of the delivering obstetrician far outweighs that of the planet or planets involved. Does this mean that fat obstetricians deliver babies that have one set of personality characteristics, and skinny ones deliver babies that have quite different characteristics? There is no correlation between the date of one’s birth and scores on any standard personality test. Birth dates of more than 16,000 scientists and 6,000 politicians found the distribution of their signs was random, the signs uniformly distributed throughout the year. The records of 3,000 married couples found no correlation between their signs and astrologers’ predictions about compatible pairs of signs. Many mundane mistakes in reasoning can be traced to a shaky grasp of the notion of conditional probability. Unless the events A and B are independent, the probability of A is different from the probability of A given that B has occurred. The probability of rolling a pair of dice and getting a 12 is 1⁄36. The conditional probability of getting a 12 when you know you have gotten at least an 11 is 1⁄3. A confusion between the probability of A given B and the probability of B given A is also quite common. Imagine a man with three cards. One is black on both sides, one red on both sides, and one black on one side and red on the other. He drops the cards into a hat and asks you to pick one, but only to look at one side; let’s assume it’s red. The man notes that the card you picked couldn’t possibly be the card that was black on both sides, and therefore it must be one of the other two cards - the red-red card or the red-black card. He offers to bet you even money that it is the red-red card. Is this a fair bet? At first glance, it seems so. There are two cards it could be; he’s betting on one, and you’re betting on the other. But the rub is that there are two ways he can win and only one way you can win. His chances of winning are thus 2⁄3. The conditional probability of the card being red-red given that it’s not black-black is ½, but that’s not the situation here. We know more than just that the card is not black-black; we also know a red side is showing. Confusing a conditional statement - if A, then B - with its converse - if B, then A - is a very common mistake. A slightly unusual version of it occurs when people reason that if X cures Y, then lack of X must cause Y. If the drug dopamine, e.g., brings about a decrease in the tremors of Parkinson’s disease, then lack of dopamine must cause tremors. If some other drug relieves the symptoms of schizophrenia, then an excess of it must cause schizophrenia. One is not as likely to make this mistake when the situation is more familiar. Not too many people believe that since aspirin cures headaches, lack of aspirin in the bloodstream must cause them. * Combinatorics (which studies various ways of counting the permutations and combinations of objects) * graph theory (which studies networks of lines and vertices and the phenomena which can be modeled by such) * game theory (the mathematical analysis of games of all sorts) * and especially probability, are increasingly important. To teach calculus is wrongheaded if it leads to the exclusion of the above topics in finite mathematics. Most priesthoods (mathematicians included) are inclined to hide behind a wall of mystery and to commune only with their fellow priests. People personalize events excessively, resisting an external perspective. Since numbers and an impersonal view of the world are intimately related, this resistance contributes to an almost willful innumeracy. They’re often attracted to New Age beliefs, since these provide them with personally customized pronouncements. Questions arise naturally when one transcends one’s self, family, and friends. How many? How long ago? How far away? How fast? What links this to that? Which is more likely? Our innate desire for meaning and pattern can lead us astray if we don’t remind ourselves of the ubiquity of coincidence. Regression to the mean is the natural behavior of any random quantity. Behavior is most likely to improve after punishment and to deteriorate after reward. The sequel to a great movie is usually not as good as the original. The same can be said of the novel after the best-seller, the album that follows the gold record. Simply another instance of regression to the mean. Choose between a sure $30,000 or an 80 percent chance of winning $40,000 and a 20 percent chance of winning nothing? The average expected gain in the latter choice is $32,000 (40,000 × .8). People tend to avoid risk when seeking gains, but choose risk to avoid losses. Imagine four dice, A, B, C, and D, strangely numbered as follows: * A has 4 on four faces and 0 on two faces * B has 3s on all six faces * C has four faces with 2 and two faces with 6 * D has 5 on three faces and 1 on three faces. If die A is rolled against die B, die A will win - by showing a higher number - two-thirds of the time. If die B is rolled against die C, B will win two-thirds of the time. If die C is rolled against die D, it will win two-thirds of the time. Nevertheless, and here’s the punch line, if die D is rolled against die A, it will win two-thirds of the time. A beats B beats C beats D beats A, all two-thirds of the time. That die C beats die D may require some explanation: Half of the time, a 1 will turn up on die D, in which case die C will certainly win. The other half of the time, a 5 will turn up on die D, in which case die C will win one-third of the time. Thus, since C can win in these two different ways, it beats D exactly ½ + (½ × 1⁄3) = 2⁄3 of the time. Social irrationality rests on a base of individual rationality. Assume that one-third of the electorate prefers Dukakis to Gore to Jackson, that another one-third prefers Gore to Jackson to Dukakis, and that the last one-third prefers Jackson to Dukakis to Gore. Dukakis will boast that two-thirds of the electorate prefer him to Gore, whereupon Jackson will respond that two-thirds of the electorate prefer him to Dukakis. Finally, Gore will counter by noting that two-thirds of the electorate prefer him to Jackson. If societal preferences are determined by majority vote, “society” prefers Dukakis over Gore, Gore over Jackson, and Jackson over Dukakis. Even if the preferences of all the individual voters are rational, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the societal preferences determined by majority rule are transitive, too. There is never a way to derive societal preferences from individual preferences that can be absolutely guaranteed to satisfy these four minimal conditions: 1. the societal preferences must be transitive 2. the preferences (individual and societal) must be restricted to available alternatives 3. if every individual prefers X to Y, then the societal preference must be for X over Y 4. and no individual’s preferences automatically determine the societal preferences. Whether we’re businessmen in a competitive market or spouses in a marriage or superpowers in an arms race, our choices can often be phrased in terms of the prisoner’s dilemma. The parties involved will be better off as a pair if each resists the temptation to double-cross the other and instead cooperates with or remains loyal to him or her. If both parties pursue their own interests exclusively, the outcome is worse than if both cooperate. Adam Smith’s invisible hand ensuring that individual pursuits bring about group wellbeing is in these situations quite paralyzed. The character of a society is reflected in which such transactions lead to cooperation between parties and which don’t. If the members of a particular “society” never behave cooperatively, their lives are likely to be, in Thomas Hobbes’s words, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.” Statistics is to probability as engineering is to physics - an applied science based on a more intellectually stimulating foundational discipline. A Type I error occurs when a true hypothesis is rejected. A Type II error occurs when a false hypothesis is accepted. When money is being distributed... the stereotypical liberal tries especially hard to avoid Type I errors (the deserving not receiving their share) the stereotypical conservative is more concerned with avoiding Type II errors (the undeserving receiving more than their share). When punishment is being meted out... the stereotypical conservative is more concerned with avoiding Type I errors (the deserving or guilty not receiving their due) the stereotypical liberal worries more about avoiding Type II errors (the undeserving or innocent receiving undue punishment). Capture-recapture method: Assume we want to know how many fish are in a certain lake. We capture one hundred of them, mark them, and then let them go. After allowing them to disperse about the lake, we catch another hundred fish and see what fraction of them are marked. If eight of the hundred we capture are marked, then a reasonable estimate of the fraction of marked fish in the whole lake is 8 percent. Of course, care must be taken that the marked fish don’t die as a result of the marking, that they’re more or less uniformly distributed about the lake, that the marked ones aren’t only the slower or more gullible among the fish, etc. Central limit theorem states that the sum (or the average) of a large bunch of measurements follows a normal curve even if the individual measurements themselves do not. Quite often, two quantities are correlated without either one being the cause of the other. Changes in both quantities to be the result of a third factor. Body lice were considered a cause of good health. When people took sick, their temperatures rose and caused the body lice to seek more hospitable abodes. The lice and good health both departed because of the fever. The correlation between the quality of a state’s day-care programs and the reported rate of child sex abuse in them is certainly not causal, but merely indicates that better supervision results in more diligent reporting of the incidents which do occur. A technically correct yet misleading statistic is the fact that heart disease and cancer are the two leading killers of Americans. This is undoubtedly true, but according to the Centers for Disease Control, accidental deaths - in car accidents, poisonings, drownings, falls, fires, and gun mishaps - result in more lost years of potential life, since the average age of these victims is considerably lower than that of the victims of cancer and heart disease. A dress whose price has been “slashed” 40 percent and then another 40 percent has been reduced in price by 64 percent, not 80. Always ask yourself: “Percentage of what?” If profits are 12 percent, for example, is this 12 percent of costs, of sales, of last year’s profits, or of what? When I hear that something or other is selling at a fraction of its normal cost, I comment that the fraction is probably 4⁄3. The “broad base” fallacy: quoting the absolute number rather than the probability. “Holiday Carnage Kills 500 Over Four-Day Weekend” (this is about the number killed in any four-day period). Someone offers you a choice of two envelopes and tells you one has twice as much money in it as the other. You pick envelope A, open it, and find $100. Envelope B must, thus, have either $200 or $50. When the proposer permits you to change your mind, you figure you have $100 to gain and only $50 to lose by switching your choice, so you take envelope B instead. The question is: Why didn’t you choose B in the first place? It’s clear that no matter what amount of money was in the envelope originally chosen, given permission to change your mind, you would always do so and take the other envelope. Without any knowledge of the probability of there being various amounts of money in the envelopes, there is no way out of this impasse. Variations of it account for some of the “grass is always greener” mentality. What’s required in many situations is not more facts - we’re inundated already - but a better command of known facts. Part of the motivation for any book is anger. The beauty of pure mathematics “cold and austere”. The sham romanticism inherent in the trite phrase “coldly rational” (as if “warmly rational” were some kind of oxymoron).","Why are so many people so mathematically illiterate? (Hence the title: illiteracy → innumeracy.) I wish I was an expert at this. I love it when someone is able to blow apart a claim in a minute, or know a good versus bad deal, just by running the numbers. I’d love to get great at this, then re-learn almost everything in life, but now with this additional lens."
The Dip,Seth Godin,1591841666,8,"Quitting is often a great strategy, a smart way to manage your life and your career. Winners quit the right stuff at the right time. Most quit in their quest to be the best in the world because the cost just seemed too high. When we say “best in the world” we mean: “Best” = best for them, right now, based on what they believe and what they know. “in the world” = their world, the world they have access to. So if I’m looking for a freelance copy editor, I want the best copy editor in English, who’s available, who can find a way to work with me at a price I can afford. That’s my best in the world. If your micromarket is “organic markets in Tulsa,” then that’s your world. Being the best in that world is the place to be. If it is worth doing, there’s probably a dip. The dip creates scarcity. Scarcity creates value. There’s a dip in the long stretch between beginner’s luck and real accomplishment. The people who invest the time, energy, and effort to power through the dip, become the best in the world. They embrace the challenge. Windsurfing is very easy - except for the wind. The wind is unpredictable. It’ll change exactly when you don’t want it to. Accounting would be easy if every incoming report were accurate and on time. Sales would be easy if it weren’t for the prospects not buying from you all the time. Marketing would be easy if every prospect and customer thought the way you do. The fact that it’s difficult and unpredictable works to your advantage. Because if it were any other way, there’d be no profit in it. When faced with the dip, many individuals and organizations diversify. If you can’t get to the next level, the thinking goes, invest your energy in learning to do something else. Hardworking, motivated people find diversification a natural outlet for their energy and drive. Diversification feels like the right thing to do. (“Who knows? This might just be the one.”) But the real success goes to those who obsess. Before you enter a new market, consider what would happen if you managed to get through the dip and win in the market you’re already in. Quitting requires you to acknowledge that you’re never going to be #1 in the world - at least not at this. So it’s easier just to put it off, not admit it. Weight training: you do a minute or two of work for no reason other than to tire out your muscle so that the last few seconds of work will cause that muscle to grow. People who train successfully pay their dues for the first minute or two and then get all the benefits at the very end. Unsuccessful trainers pay exactly the same dues but stop a few seconds too early. Be a lot choosier about which journeys you start. Know before you start whether or not you have the resources and the will to get to the end. If you can’t make it through the dip, don’t start. If you’re going to quit, quit before you start. Don’t play the game if you realize you can’t be the best in the world. Reject the system. To be a superstar, find a field with a steep barrier between those who try and those who succeed. Quit the projects and investments and endeavors that don’t offer you the same opportunity. Seven reasons you might fail to become the best in the world: * run out of time * run out of money * get scared * not serious * lose interest or enthusiasm or settle for being mediocre * focus on the short term instead of the long * pick the wrong thing at which to be the best If you fail to become the best in the world, it’s either because you planned wrong or because you gave up before you reached your goal. The manufacturing dip: easy and fun to start building something in your garage. Difficult and expensive to buy an injection mold, design an integrated circuit, or ramp up for large-scale production. The sales dip: to upgrade to a professional sales force and scale it up. The education dip: when it’s time to go learn something new, to reinvent or rebuild your skills. The risk dip: Bootstrappers learn that they can’t pay for it all themselves. It takes a risk to rent a bigger space or invest in new techniques. The difference between investing to get through the dip (a smart move) or investing in something that’s actually a risky crapshoot. The relationship dip: Invest the time and effort to work with people and organizations that can help you later. Invest in relationships back when it was difficult (but not urgent). The conceptual dip: You got this far operating under one set of assumptions. Abandoning those assumptions and embracing a new, bigger set may be exactly what you need to do to get to the next level. The ego dip: Giving up control and leaning into the organization The distribution dip: Everyone is on the Web, but getting into Wal-Mart is hard. The opposite of quitting is rededication - an invigorated new strategy designed to break the problem apart. Short-term pain has more impact on most people than long-term benefits do. That’s why it’s so important for you to amplify the long-term benefits of not quitting. When people quit, they are often focused on the short-term benefits. Lean into a problem. Lean so far that you might just lean right through it. If you move (companies, places), you get to reinvent yourself. No one in the new place will remember you from ten years ago. They’ll treat you as the new you, the you with an endless upside and little past. Quitting as a short-term strategy is a bad idea. Quitting for the long term is an excellent idea. “Never Quit” was a bad piece of advice. I think the advice-giver meant to say: “Never quit something with great long-term potential just because you can’t deal with the stress of the moment.” Hurting your pride is not fatal. Quitting is not the same as panicking. Panic is never premeditated. Panic attacks us, it grabs us, it is in the moment. Quitting when you’re panicked is dangerous and expensive. The best quitters are the ones who decide in advance when they’re going to quit. You can always quit later - so wait until you’re done panicking to decide. Sergey Brin: “We knew that Google was going to get better every single day as we worked on it, and we knew that sooner or later, everyone was going to try it. So our feeling was that the later you tried it, the better it was for us because we’d make a better impression with better technology. So we were never in a big hurry to get you to use it today. Tomorrow would be better.” Before quitting, ask yourself what measurable progress you’re making. You’re either moving forward, falling behind, or standing still. To stick with it in the absence of forward progress - is a waste. It needs to be more than just “surviving is succeeding.” Quitting a job doesn’t have to mean giving up. A job is just a tactic, a way to get to what you really want. As soon as your job hits a dead end, it makes sense to quit. Before you start something, write down under what circumstances you’re willing to quit. And when. And then stick with it.","Tiny quick read with a punchy point: Anything worth doing has a painfully-hard middle period, which is where most people quit. But knowing this in advance, ask yourself seriously if you really have the dedication to stick it through that hard time. If not, then don’t begin! Quit in advance! But if so, then expect that dark dip, and don’t quit when you’re in it. Read the whole book if this applies to you. There’s not a wasted page."
"Guns, Germs, and Steel",Jared Diamond,0393061310,8,"Weapons at Cro-Magnon sites include harpoons, spear-throwers, and eventually bows and arrows. Those efficient means of killing at a safe distance permitted the hunting of such dangerous prey as rhinos and elephants, while the invention of rope for nets, lines, and snares allowed the addition of fish and birds to our diet. During the Ice Ages, so much of the oceans’ water was locked up in glaciers that worldwide sea levels dropped hundreds of feet below their present stand. As a result, what are now the shallow seas between Asia and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and Bali became dry land. (So did other shallow straits, such as the Bering Strait and the English Channel.) Big mammals of Africa and Eurasia survived into modern times, because they had coevolved with protohumans for millions of years. They thereby enjoyed ample time to evolve a fear of humans, as our ancestors’ initially poor hunting skills slowly improved. The dodo, moas, and perhaps the giants of Australia / New Guinea had the misfortune suddenly to be confronted, without any evolutionary preparation, by invading modern humans possessing fully developed hunting skills. The disappearance of all of the big animals of Australia / New Guinea had heavy consequences. Those extinctions eliminated all the large wild animals that might otherwise have been candidates for domestication, and left native Australians and New Guineans with not a single native domestic animal. Human presence expanded 8,000 miles south in less than a thousand years. However, that translates into an average expansion of only 8 miles per year, a trivial feat for a hunter-gatherer likely to cover that distance even within a single day’s normal foraging. The Americas evidently filled up with humans so quickly that people were motivated to keep spreading south toward Patagonia. At an average population density of somewhat under one person per square mile (a high value for modern hunter-gatherers), then the whole area of the Americas would eventually have held about 10 million hunter-gatherers. But even if the initial colonists had consisted of only 100 people and their numbers had increased at a rate of only 1.1 percent per year, the colonists’ descendants would have reached that population ceiling of 10 million people within a thousand years. About 15,000 years ago, the American West looked much as Africa’s Serengeti Plains do today, with herds of elephants and horses pursued by lions and cheetahs, and joined by members of such exotic species as camels and giant ground sloths. Just as in Australia / New Guinea, in the Americas most of those large mammals became extinct. Most large wild mammal species that might otherwise have later been domesticated by Native Americans were thereby removed. Of the five habitable continents, North America and South America are the ones with the shortest human prehistories. The settlement of the world’s remaining islands was not completed until modern times: Mediterranean islands such as Crete, Cyprus, Corsica, and Sardinia between about 8500 and 4000 B.C.; Caribbean islands beginning around 4000 B.C.; Polynesian and Micronesian islands between 1200 B.C. and A.D. 1000; Madagascar sometime between A.D. 300 and 800; and Iceland in the ninth century A.D. What, really, does a “head start” mean for the purposes of this book? We cannot take the metaphor of a footrace literally. Maori developing more-complex and the Moriori less-complex technology and political organization. The Moriori reverted to being hunter-gatherers, while the North Island Maori turned to more intensive farming. Those opposite evolutionary courses sealed the outcome of their eventual collision. The larger the size and the higher the density, the more complex and specialized were the technology and organization. At high population densities only a portion of the people came to be farmers, but they were mobilized to devote themselves to intensive food production, thereby yielding surpluses to feed nonproducers. The nonproducers mobilizing them included chiefs, priests, bureaucrats, and warriors. The biggest political units could assemble large labor forces to construct irrigation systems and fishponds that intensified food production even further. All those differences among Polynesian societies developed, within a relatively short time and modest fraction of the Earth’s surface, as environmentally related variations on a single ancestral society. Those categories of cultural differences within Polynesia are essentially the same categories that emerged everywhere else in the world. Plant domestication may be defined as growing a plant and thereby, consciously or unconsciously, causing it to change genetically from its wild ancestor in ways making it more useful to human consumers. Crop development is today a conscious, highly specialized effort. Peas were domesticated by 8000 B.C., olives around 4000 B.C., strawberries not until the Middle Ages, and pecans not until 1846. Edible acorns remain untamed even today. Some plant species trick an animal into carrying their seeds, by wrapping the seed in a tasty fruit and advertising the fruit’s ripeness by its color or smell. The hungry animal plucks and swallows the fruit, walks or flies off, and then spits out or defecates the seed somewhere far from its parent tree. The seeds of many wild plant species actually must pass through an animal’s gut before they can germinate. One African melon species is so well adapted to being eaten by the aardvark that most melons of that species grow on the latrine sites of aardvarks. Strawberry plants evolved through natural selection. The sweeter and redder the final strawberry, the more numerous the birds that dispersed its ripe seeds. When the first farmers began to sow seeds deliberately, they would inevitably sow those from the plants they had chosen to gather, even though they didn’t understand the genetic principle that big berries have seeds likely to grow into bushes yielding more big berries. That provides part of the explanation why many crop plants have much bigger fruits than their wild ancestors do. It’s especially familiar to us that supermarket strawberries and blueberries are gigantic compared with wild ones; those differences arose only in recent centuries. Supermarket apples are typically around three inches in diameter, wild apples only one inch. The oldest corn cobs are barely more than half an inch long, but Mexican Indian farmers of A.D. 1500 already had developed six-inch cobs, and some modern cobs are one and a half feet long. Natural selection acts oppositely on seeds and on fruits. Plants whose fruits are tasty get their seeds dispersed by animals, but the seed itself within the fruit has to be bad-tasting. Otherwise, the animal would also chew up the seed, and it couldn’t sprout. Seedlessness provides a good example of how human selection can completely reverse the original evolved function of a wild fruit, which in nature serves as a vehicle for dispersing seeds. Wild wheat and barley seeds grow at the top of a stalk that spontaneously shatters, dropping the seeds to the ground where they can germinate. A single-gene mutation prevents the stalks from shattering. In the wild that mutation would be lethal to the plant. But those mutant seeds would have been the ones waiting conveniently on the stalk to be harvested and brought home by humans. When humans then planted those harvested mutant seeds, any mutant seeds among the progeny again became available to the farmers to harvest and sow, while normal seeds among the progeny fell to the ground and became unavailable. Thus, human farmers reversed the direction of natural selection. Over 10,000 years ago, that unconscious selection was apparently the first major human “improvement” in any plant. That change marked the beginning of agriculture. The development of industrial melanism in British moths: darker moth individuals became relatively commoner than paler individuals as the environment became dirtier during the 19th century, because dark moths resting on a dark, dirty tree were more likely than contrasting pale moths to escape the attention of predators. Strawberries remained the little berries that thrushes wanted, not the big berries that humans wanted. Only with the recent development of protective nets and greenhouses were we finally able to defeat the thrushes, and to redesign strawberries and raspberries according to our own standards. Differences followed straightforwardly from the differing suites of wild plant and animal species available for domestication, not from limitations of the peoples themselves. The famous first sentence of Tolstoy’s great novel Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” By that sentence, Tolstoy meant that, in order to be happy, a marriage must succeed in many different respects: sexual attraction, agreement about money, child discipline, religion, in-laws, and other vital issues. Failure in any one of those essential respects can doom a marriage even if it has all the other ingredients needed for happiness. This principle can be extended to understanding much else about life besides marriage. We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many separate possible causes of failure. A domesticated animal is defined as an animal selectively bred in captivity and thereby modified from its wild ancestors, for use by humans who control the animal’s breeding and food supply. The wild ancestors of 13 of the Ancient Fourteen (including all of the Major Five) were confined to Eurasia. This very unequal distribution of wild ancestral species among the continents became an important reason why Eurasians, rather than peoples of other continents, were the ones to end up with guns, germs, and steel. The explanation for the lack of native mammal domestication outside Eurasia lay with the locally available wild mammals themselves, not with the local peoples. There is no doubt that Europeans developed a big advantage in weaponry, technology, and political organization over most of the non-European peoples that they conquered. But that advantage alone doesn’t fully explain how initially so few European immigrants came to supplant so much of the native population of the Americas and some other parts of the world. That might not have happened without Europe’s sinister gift to other continents - the germs evolving from Eurasians’ long intimacy with domestic animals. Inventing a writing system from scratch must have been incomparably more difficult than borrowing and adapting one. The two indisputably independent inventions of writing were achieved by the Sumerians of Mesopotamia somewhat before 3000 B.C. and by Mexican Indians before 600 B.C. (Figure 12.1); Egyptian writing of 3000 B.C. and Chinese writing (by 1300 B.C.) may also have arisen independently. Probably all other peoples who have developed writing since then have borrowed, adapted, or at least been inspired by existing systems. The Phaistos disk anticipates humanity’s next efforts at printing. However, those next efforts did not appear until 2,500 years later in China and 3,100 years later in medieval Europe. Invention is often the mother of necessity, rather than vice versa. The motor vehicle was not invented in response to any demand. Only after about 20 years did Edison reluctantly concede that the main use of his phonograph was to record and play music. That “heroic theory of invention,” as it is termed, is encouraged by patent law, because an applicant for a patent must prove the novelty of the invention submitted. Inventors thereby have a financial incentive to denigrate or ignore previous work. From a patent lawyer’s perspective, the ideal invention is one that arises without any precursors. Edison’s famous “invention” of the incandescent light bulb on the night of October 21, 1879, improved on many other incandescent light bulbs patented by other inventors between 1841 and 1878. All recognized famous inventors had capable predecessors and successors and made their improvements at a time when society was capable of using their product. Technology finds most of its uses after it has been invented, rather than being invented to meet a foreseen need. The most isolated people on Earth in recent history were the Aboriginal Tasmanians, living without oceangoing watercraft on an island 100 miles from Australia, itself the most isolated continent. The Tasmanians had no contact with other societies for 10,000 years and acquired no new technology other than what they invented themselves. Sedentary living was decisive for the history of technology, because it enabled people to accumulate nonportable possessions. Variations in these three factors - time of onset of food production, barriers to diffusion, and human population size - led straightforwardly to the observed intercontinental differences in the development of technology. The main axis of the Americas is north-south, forcing most diffusion to go against a gradient of latitude (and climate) rather than to operate within the same latitude. For example, wheels were invented in Mesoamerica, and llamas were domesticated in the central Andes by 3000 B.C., but 5,000 years later the Americas’ sole beast of burden and sole wheels had still not encountered each other, even though the distance separating Mesoamerica’s Maya societies from the northern border of the Inca Empire (1,200 miles) was far less than the 6,000 miles separating wheel- and horse-sharing France and China. The New Guineans whom I know include potential Edisons. But they directed their ingenuity toward technological problems appropriate to their situations: the problems of surviving without any imported items in the New Guinea jungle, rather than the problem of inventing phonographs. With the rise of chiefdoms around 7,500 years ago, people had to learn, for the first time in history, how to encounter strangers regularly without attempting to kill them. Part of the solution to that problem was for one person, the chief, to exercise a monopoly on the right to use force. Size of the regional population is the strongest single predictor of societal complexity. A large but simple society could not maintain itself. New Guinea has by far the highest concentration of languages in the world: 1,000 out of the world’s 6,000 languages, divided into dozens of language families and isolated languages as different from each other as English is from Chinese. Nearly half of all New Guinea languages have fewer than 500 speakers. All but one of the world’s six most populous nations are melting pots that achieved political unification recently, and that still support hundreds of languages and ethnic groups. The great exception to this rule of the recent melting pot is China. But it seems absurd to ask how China became Chinese. China has been Chinese, almost from the beginnings of its recorded history. China’s size and ecological diversity spawned many separate local cultures. In the fourth millennium B.C. those local cultures expanded geographically and began to interact, compete with each other, and coalesce. Exchanges between culturally diverse regions enriched Chinese culture and technology, and fierce competition between warring chiefdoms drove the formation of ever larger and more centralized states. Geographic factors contributed to the early cultural and political unification of China, whereas western Europe, with a similar area but a more rugged terrain and no such unifying rivers, has resisted cultural and political unification to this day. The historical southward expansions of Burmese, Laotians, and Thais from South China completed the Sinification of tropical Southeast Asia. All those modern peoples are recent offshoots of their South Chinese cousins. So overwhelming was this Chinese steamroller that the former peoples of tropical Southeast Asia have left behind few traces in the region’s modern populations. Just three relict groups of hunter-gatherers - the Semang Negritos of the Malay Peninsula, the Andaman Islanders, and the Veddoid Negritos of Sri Lanka - remain to suggest that tropical Southeast Asia’s former inhabitants may have been dark-skinned and curly-haired, Only on the remote Andaman Islands do languages unrelated to the South Chinese language families persist - the last linguistic survivors of what must have been hundreds of now extinct aboriginal Southeast Asian languages. Korea and Japan were heavily influenced by China, although their geographic isolation from it ensured that they did not lose their languages or physical and genetic distinctness, as did tropical Southeast Asia. Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous nation: big overseas movements long before Columbus, and prehistoric replacements of non-European peoples by other non-European peoples. Before the recent overseas expansion of Europeans speaking Indo-European languages, Austronesian was the most widespread language family in the world. Taiwan is the homeland where Austronesian languages have been spoken for the most millennia. All other Austronesian languages stem from a population expansion out of Taiwan. The last phases of the expansion, during the millennium after A.D. 1, resulted in the colonization of every Polynesian and Micronesian island capable of supporting humans. Astonishingly, it also swept westward across the Indian Ocean to the east coast of Africa, resulting in the colonization of the island of Madagascar. The invention of the double-outrigger sailing canoe may have been the technological breakthrough that triggered the Austronesian expansion from the Chinese mainland. In China the entire region was politically unified. One decision stopped fleets over the whole of China. That one temporary decision became irreversible. Contrast those events in China with what happened when fleets of exploration began to sail from politically fragmented Europe. Christopher Columbus, an Italian by birth, switched his allegiance to the duke of Anjou in France, then to the king of Portugal. When the latter refused his request for ships in which to explore westward, Columbus turned to the duke of Medina-Sedonia, who also refused, then to the count of Medina-Celi, who did likewise, and finally to the king and queen of Spain, who denied Columbus’s first request but eventually granted his renewed appeal. Had Europe been united under any one of the first three rulers, its colonization of the Americas might have been stillborn. In fact, precisely because Europe was fragmented, Columbus succeeded on his fifth try in persuading one of Europe’s hundreds of princes to sponsor him. Once Spain had thus launched the European colonization of America, other European states saw the wealth flowing into Spain, and six more joined in colonizing America. The story was the same with Europe’s cannon, electric lighting, printing, small firearms, and innumerable other innovations: each was at first neglected or opposed in some parts of Europe for idiosyncratic reasons, but once adopted in one area, it eventually spread to the rest of Europe. These consequences of Europe’s disunity stand in sharp contrast to those of China’s unity. Navigation: China abandoned development of an elaborate water-driven spinning machine, stepped back from the verge of an industrial revolution in the 14th century, demolished or virtually abolished mechanical clocks after leading the world in clock construction, and retreated from mechanical devices and technology in general after the late 15th century. Those potentially harmful effects of unity have flared up again in modern China, notably during the madness of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, when a decision by one or a few leaders closed the whole country’s school systems for five years. To understand China’s chronic unity and Europe’s chronic disunity. The answer is again suggested by maps. Europe has a highly indented coastline, with five large peninsulas that approach islands in their isolation. China’s coastline is much smoother, and only the nearby Korean Peninsula attained separate importance. Europe is carved up into independent linguistic, ethnic, and political units by high mountains, while China’s mountains east of the Tibetan plateau are much less formidable barriers. China’s heartland is bound together from east to west by two long navigable river systems. Geographic connectedness has exerted both positive and negative effects on the evolution of technology. The histories of the Fertile Crescent and China also hold a salutary lesson for the modern world: circumstances change, and past primacy is no guarantee of future primacy. Societies developed differently on different continents because of differences in continental environments, not in human biology. Advanced technology, centralized political organization, and other features of complex societies could emerge only in dense sedentary populations capable of accumulating food surpluses - populations that depended for their food on the rise of agriculture that began around 8,500 B.C. But the domesticable wild plant and animal species essential for that rise of agriculture were distributed very unevenly over the continents. The most valuable domesticable wild species were concentrated in only nine small areas of the globe, which thus became the earliest homelands of agriculture. The original inhabitants of those homelands thereby gained a head start toward developing guns, germs, and steel. The languages and genes of those homeland inhabitants, as well as their livestock, crops, technologies, and writing systems, became dominant in the ancient and modern world. In the early 1800s, European traders, missionaries, and whalers began to visit New Zealand, which had been occupied 600 years previously by Polynesian farmers and fishermen known as Maoris. Optimal Fragmentation Principle: innovation proceeds most rapidly in a society with some optimal intermediate degree of fragmentation: a too-unified society is at a disadvantage, and so is a too-fragmented society. If your goal is innovation and competitive ability, you don’t want either excessive unity or excessive fragmentation. Instead, you want your country, industry, industrial belt, or company to be broken up into groups that compete with one another while maintaining relatively free communication - like the U.S. federal government system, with its built-in competition between our 50 states.",Why did the people of certain continents succeeded in invading other continents and conquering or displacing their people?

Take jobs where I can learn things that I can use in my work later - my library job taught me how to do research, my Web design job taught me how to build websites, and my copywriting job taught me how to sell things with words. Day job gives you a daily routine in which you can schedule a regular time for your creative pursuits. Establishing and keeping a routine can be even more important than having a lot of time. Work gets done in the time available. Find a day job that pays decently, and leaves you with enough energy to make things in your spare time. In this age of information abundance and overload, those who get ahead will be the folks who figure out what to leave out, so they can concentrate on what’s really important. The way to get over creative block is to simply place some constraints on yourself. Write a song on your lunch break. Paint a painting with only one color. Start a business without any start-up capital. Shoot a movie with your iPhone. Don’t make excuses for not working. Some advice can be a vice.","Short, inspiring insights into creativity and the creative life: the day job, the mindset, etc. Also read his other book “Show Your Work”."
A Mind for Numbers,Barbara Oakley,039916524X,8,"Your brain can work on a problem while you are sleeping only if you concentrate on trying to solve the problem before falling asleep. Toggle your thinking - getting a glimpse of what you are learning before returning later to more fully understand what’s going on. Spending a minute or two glancing ahead before you read in depth will help you organize your thoughts. You’re creating little neural hooks to hang your thinking on. Focused mode is used to concentrate on something that’s already tightly connected in your mind, because you are familiar and comfortable with the underlying concepts. The diffuse approach involves a big-picture perspective. Useful when you are learning something new. If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your “big picture” diffuse mode. As long as we are consciously focusing on a problem, we are blocking the diffuse mode. Do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of the problem. Accepting the first idea that comes to mind can prevent you from finding a better solution. A few hours is long enough for the diffuse mode to make significant progress but not so long that its insights fade away. When you are first learning new concepts, don't let things go untouched for longer than a day. Frustration is usually a good time-out signal. Repeating something twenty times in one evening, it won’t stick nearly as well as it will if you practice it the same number of times over several days or weeks. Einstellung: “a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though ""better"" or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exist. The Einstellung effect is the negative effect of previous experience when solving new problems.” The best language programs incorporate structured practice that includes plenty of repetition and rote, focused-mode learning of the language, along with more diffuse-like free speech with native speakers. Once you chunk an idea or concept, you don’t need to remember all the little underlying details; you’ve got the main idea - the chunk - and that’s enough. Rereading text seems to be effective if you let time pass between rereadings so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition. Glancing at the solution to a problem and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning. Key to the slow hunch is simply having mental access to aspects of an idea. That way, some aspects can tentatively and randomly combine with others until eventually, beautiful novelty can emerge. A key difference between creative scientists and technically competent but nonimaginative ones is their breadth of interest. Strengthening an initial learning pattern within a day after you first begin forming it is important. Recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study helps you strengthen your grasp of the material by viewing it from a different perspective. Practice by doing a mixture of different kinds of problems requiring different strategies. Overlearning means a student continues to study or practice immediately after some criterion has been achieved. Once they understand ‘X,’ they should move on to something else and return to ‘X’ on another day. Rather than devote a long session to the study or practice of the same skill, students should divide their effort across several shorter sessions. Two men sat in front of the audience and blithely downed more than double a deadly dose of arsenic. In tiny doses, arsenic doesn’t seem harmful. You can even build up an immunity to its effects. This can allow you to take large doses and look healthy even as the poison is slowly increasing your risk of cancer and ravaging your organs. Procrastinators put off just that one little thing. They do it again and again, gradually growing used to it. They can even look healthy. The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself. Learned industriousness helps brighten tasks you once thought were boring. Use the “Pomodoro”. If you learn under mild stress, you can handle greater stress much more easily. By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself (Am I getting closer to finishing?) and allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work. Work a key problem all the way through. Do another repetition of the problem. Before you go to sleep, work the problem again. As soon as you can the next day, work the problem again. You should see that you are able to solve the problem more quickly now. Your understanding should be deeper. You may even wonder why you ever had any trouble with it. We trick ourselves into doing what we ought to be doing. The highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives. The smart part of us sets up things for us to do that the not-so-smart part responds to almost automatically, Those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill. Transform distant deadlines into daily ones. Calculus Made Easy, by Silvanus Thompson, has helped generations of students master the subject. “Do you know the crazy shape of the crankshaft in a car?” “Yeah, what of it?” “Good. Now tell me: How did you describe it when you were talking to yourself?” It was then that Feynman realized that thoughts can be visual as well as verbal.","Thought I was getting a book about math, but ended up being a surprisingly good book about learning in general. Main points are about diffused thinking vs focused thinking."
Smartcuts,Shane Snow,13206824,8,"You are driving a car in the middle of a thunderstorm and you happen upon three people on the side of the road. One of them is a frail old woman, who looks on the verge of collapse. Another is a friend who once saved your life. The other is the romantic interest of your dreams, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet him or her. You have only one other seat in the car. Who do you pick up? The old woman, of course. Then, give the car keys to your friend, and stay behind with the romantic interest to wait for the bus! An exercise in lateral thinking. It’s the kind of puzzle in which the most elegant solution is revealed only when you attack it sideways. New ideas emerge when you question the assumptions upon which a problem is based (in this case: it’s that you can only help one person). Lateral thinking doesn’t replace hard work; it eliminates unnecessary cycles. Once they’ve shortened their path, overachievers tend to look for ways to do more with their effort. Momentum - not experience - is the single biggest predictor of business and personal success. The common pattern among these fastest-rising US presidents’ journeys is that they didn’t parlay up a linear path. They climbed various ladders of success and then switched to the presidential ladder. The people that go into Congress go step by step by step, but presidents don’t. Companies that pivot - that is, switch business models or products - while on the upswing tend to perform much better than those that stay on a single course. Switching ladders can help bypass “dues” and accelerate the Bigger or Better cycle. The mentor story is so common because it seems to work - especially when the mentor is not just a teacher, but someone who’s traveled the road. We can spend thousands of hours practicing until we master a skill, or we can convince a world-class practitioner to guide our practice and cut the time to mastery significantly. Those who train with successful people who’ve “been there” tend to achieve success faster. The winning formula, it seems, is to seek out the world’s best and convince them to coach us. Informal mentoring produced a larger and more significant effect on career outcomes than formal mentoring. Asking someone to formally mentor you is like asking a celebrity for an autograph; it’s stiff, inorganic, and often doesn’t work out. With every increase in communication, we increase our access to the great models in every category. To study the moves that make masters great: Two people can study the same business model, watch the same video, or even take the same advice from a mentor, and one person might pick up critical details that the other misses. This is a key difference between those who learn more quickly than others. Jimmy Fallon: Manager Siegel cared more about his long-term journey than his short-term paycheck; she screened every offer through the lens of, “Will this help Jimmy get SNL one day?” He said “no” to television sitcoms, “no” to acting jobs that might take him too far away from SNL. Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes. An entrepreneur who’d failed in a previous venture was not likely to do better than someone who’d never run a business in her life. Successful entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are 50 percent more likely to succeed in a second venture. The more you win, the more likely you are to win again. Looks like the advice of “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” and “failure makes you wiser” isn’t actually true. Surgeons who botched the new procedure tended to do worse in subsequent surgeries. Rather than learning from their mistakes, their success rates continuously declined. On the other hand, when surgeons did well on the new surgery, more successes tended to follow. Surgeons who SAW their colleagues fail at the new CABG procedure showed significant increases in their own success rates with every failure that they saw another doctor experience. Even though an individual failure experience may contain valuable knowledge, without subsequent effort to reflect upon that experience, the potential learning will remain untapped. This made the failure of a colleague quite valuable. Since it was that guy’s fault, fellow surgeons instinctually zeroed in on the mistakes. “I’ll make sure not to do that.” A high-pressure feedback barrage tends to make us self-conscious. We get stuck inside our own heads. The closer feedback moves our attention to ourselves, the worse it is for us. The research showed that experts - people who were masters at a trade - vastly preferred negative feedback to positive. It spurred the most improvement. The tough part about negative feedback is in separating ourselves from the perceived failure and turning our experiences into objective experiments. But when we do that, feedback becomes much more powerful. By embracing all these tiny failures, there is no actual failure. How most businesses operate: When releasing a new product, a company will spend months, sometimes years, fine-tuning, building up to one critical moment: the launch. Then on launch day the product either is a success or a failure. People buy it and the company makes a profit, or they don’t and the product fails. Upworthy sent the same video with a handful of different headlines to different subscribers. Upworthy wrote alternate versions of the winning headline and sent it out to several other groups. It repeated the process a ruthless 18 times, for a total of 75 variations in all. DHH: “If I can put in 5 percent of the effort of somebody getting an A, and I can get a C minus, that’s amazing. It’s certainly good enough, right? [Then] I can take the other 95 percent of the time and invest it in something I really care about.” DHH says, “You can accelerate your training if you know how to train properly, but you still don’t need to be that special. I don’t think I’m that special of a programmer or a businessperson or a race car driver. I just know how to train.” “I think it’s a great mistake to force children to learn mathematics,” said renowned physicist Freeman Dyson. “What we really need is to teach kids to use tools that do math for us.” Students who use calculators have better attitudes toward math, and are more likely to pursue highly computational careers. To get kids to become interested in an academic subject on their own, they have to play. Building with LEGOs, visiting museums, experimenting with tools. Says Dyson, “Mathematics ought to be entertainment.” By learning the tool (calculator) first, we actually master the discipline (math) faster. The most important benefit of having supereducated instructors is that a better-trained teacher is more adept at teaching children how to learn, whereas the coach-turned-geography-teacher will often teach how to memorize. Luck is often talked about as “being in the right place at the right time.” But like a surfer, some people - and companies - are adept at placing themselves at the right place at the right time. They seek out opportunity rather than wait for it. Surfers can recognize the roll of incoming waves, so they can position themselves in the perfect spot to catch them. And at the last minute, a surfer will paddle vigorously to align herself with the wave and match its speed. Pattern recognition - spotting a wave early and casually drifting to the sweet spot. Pattern recognition seems to come with experience and practice. While logging hours of practice helps us see patterns subconsciously, we can often do just as well by deliberately looking for them. Pattern hunting and deliberate analysis can yield results with high accuracy on the first try. Deliberate pattern spotting can compensate for experience. But we often don’t even give it a shot. Through deliberate analysis, the little guy can spot waves better than the big company that relies on experience and instinct once it’s at the top. And a wave can take an amateur farther faster than an expert can swim. First movers have to create their own wagon trails, but later movers can follow in the ruts. First movers take on the burden of educating customers, setting up infrastructure, getting regulatory approvals, and making mistakes. Fast followers, on the other hand, benefit from free-rider effects. The pioneers clear the way in terms of market education and infrastructure and learn the hard lessons, so the next guys can steal what works, learn objectively from the first movers’ failures, and spend more effort elsewhere. The first wave clears the way for a more powerful ride. While the pioneers were entrenched in early technology and practices, the tailgaters got ahead. Conventional thinking leads talented and driven people to believe that if they simply work hard, luck will eventually strike. That’s like saying if a surfer treads water in the same spot for long enough, a wave will come; it certainly happens to some people, once in a while, but it’s not the most effective strategy for success. Paradoxically, it’s actually a lazier move. Which is easier - making friends with a thousand people one by one or making friends with someone who already has a thousand friends? Which is faster - going door to door with a message or broadcasting the message to a million homes at once? Superconnecting, the act of making mass connections by tapping into hubs with many spokes. Before radio, 300 outcasts hiding in the jungle could not have overthrown a powerful military dictatorship. But with radio, those outcasts could connect to the 5 million oppressed Cuban citizens who secretly shared the rebellion’s dissatisfaction, and turn the tide against the dictator, tanks and planes and all. J. J. Abrams is “a giver,” a rarity in an industry full of takers. Look at Abrams’s credits from after he became wildly successful; it turns out that even once he was on top, he continued to cowrite, codirect, and cocreate almost all his projects. He started lending his own Sinatra-style credibility to less known but talented writers and directors and actors, so they could climb their ladders faster. When Sonny (Skrillex) remixed artists like Lady Gaga or Avicii or Nero, he gave their tracks a boost and helped them reach new fans. This in turn superconnected Moore to audiences larger than his own and led to surges in his popularity. When we give and teach, we build up fan bases that become more likely to support us. Giving is the timeless smartcut for harnessing superconnectors and creating serendipity. When money is available in near-limitless quantities, the victim sinks into a kind of inertia. The trouble with moonwalkers and billionaires is when they arrive at the top, their momentum often stops. If they don’t manage to find something to parlay, they turn into the kid on the jungle gym who just hangs from the ring. So how does one avoid billionaire’s depression? Progress. A sense of forward motion. Regardless how small. Though they were both operating at breakeven with the same revenues, investors valued Company B at double the price of Company A, simply because Company B had more momentum. Investors see momentum and future success as so highly correlated that they will take bigger bets on companies with fast-growing user bases even if the companies are bleeding money. Momentum, it turns out, can cover a multitude of sins. The perception of momentum is often as good as momentum. Like a surfer arriving hours before a competition to watch the waves, “I would study the algorithm of YouTube’s front page” for months, Phan says. <https://www.youtube.com/user/MichellePhan> “I noticed that they only would post up videos with a lot of views [on the home page], and you only have 2 days to capitalize off of all these views.” However, YouTube didn’t update the home page on weekends, she realized. If she managed to get a video on there on a Thursday, “I [could] be there for an extra 2 days.” Phan’s backlog of content allowed her to take the momentum caused by waves and superconnectors and capture it. When she posted more videos, they kept her swinging from ring to ring. By constantly feeding them with great new content, she transformed her video series into a career and a company. “Most YouTubers just kind of drop off around a certain time; it’s hard to keep that momentum,” Phan says. “I [had] to strike while the iron’s hot.” The secret to harnessing momentum is to build up potential energy, so that unexpected opportunities can be amplified. Success is like a lightning bolt. It’ll strike you when you least expect it, and you just have to keep the momentum going. The lack of in-school athletics allowed Finland to focus minds and resources and sprint forward academically. Students start learning vocations like engineering and business as soon as they hit high school. They skip many of the general education courses most of us forget. Elon Musk: To gain support for his big vision, he would himself have to step into the public spotlight. In other words, he had to get people to believe. So the geek brushed up on speaking skills and started talking big. This-is-the-future-of-mankind big. Incremental progress, he says, depends on working harder. More resources, more effort. 10x progress is built on bravery and creativity instead. Working smarter. In other words, 10x goals force you to come up with smartcuts. If you can get people to let go of their fear, and to be more intellectually open, intellectually honest, more dispassionate about being creative, trying new things, and then being honest about what the results are instead of having all these other issues cloud their judgment, you can get to radically better solutions in honestly about the same amount of time, about the same amount of resources, as making the 10-percent improvement.” Behavioral psychologists Stephen M. Garcia and Avishalom Tor showed that merely knowing there are more competitors in a competition decreases our performance. Businesspeople will tell you that the presence of one or two serious rivals is incredibly motivating. When the rivals number in the thousands, it’s a different type of game. Brands with lofty purposes beyond making profits wildly outperformed the S&P 500.","Inspiring study of how successful people took smart shortcuts and bypassed the long-slogging dues-paying process.

Superhuman by Habit,Tynan,B00NGC8I9E,8,"I write every single day, study a foreign language every day, work on my big projects every day, eat healthy every day, work out every other day, and maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Habits are the closest we can get to having superpowers. A habit is an action that you take on a repeated basis with little or no required effort or thought. It's a loophole that allows you to upgrade your health, quality of life, productivity, and enjoyment of the world with a fixed expenditure of energy in creating a habit, rather than on an ongoing drain on your willpower. Establishing most habits takes the relatively short time of one to twelve months. If you procrastinated today, it's because you've built the habit of procrastinating. Even your outlook on life is the product of your habits. New habits are things that you do, but old habits are things that you are. To improve yourself permanently, develop more old habits by creating new habits and sticking with them until they mature into old habits. Be very scared to fail to execute a habit, even once. This is a huge deal and should not be treated lightly. So make your habits relatively easy, but never miss doing them. Planning a variance, make it concrete, black and white, and specify exactly when the variance will end. For example, instead of doing your regular gym routine while traveling through Europe, you commit to do twenty pushups every morning, and then as soon as you return home, resume your normal routine. What do you do when you've promised yourself that you'll write five hundred words every single day, but you're sick, tired, busy, and can't think of a single thing to write about? Just do a terrible job. It is far far worse to skip doing something than to just do a horrible job of it. Doing a crappy job makes you feel a little bit guilty, but also proud that you worked through a tough time. Your brain figures out that if it just puts a few small barriers in your way, it can go back to resting. Classic manifestation of this is tiredness while working. Push through and work anyway. Just do a terrible job if necessary, but make it clear to your brain that putting up token objections isn't enough to give it a rest. You'll find that you don't get tired when you work. Take pride in process, not in results. I suggest a top-down approach to habit building, picking off the big ones and then going for the little ones. I made a list of six things I was allowed to do (work, eat, sleep, read after midnight, play violin, talk to girls), intentionally making it so that talking to girls was the most fun thing I was allowed to do. If you are not going to follow through with a habit, it is better to never start it at all. In most areas of life it's better to try and to fail than to not try at all. In habits it's far better to succeed at an easier habit, and then build up from there. Daily habits are hard to overlook or miss, and low intensity habits are easy to complete. Instead of starting with thirty minutes every other day, you resolve to meditate for just one minute every single day. This sounds ridiculous, but once it becomes part of your life, doubling it to two minutes is also very easy. Creatine: It allows your muscles to hold more water, which helps them lift more, which in turn breaks down muscle fiber more quickly, which allows you to build muscle more quickly. You take a loading dose for a week or ten days. Then, once you've built up a baseline level of creatine, you drop the dose to a fraction of the loading dose and take this maintenance dose every day. Have one very strict habit for loading, and then another to maintain. How do you know when to switch from your loading habit to your maintenance habit? The key is to be able to honestly evaluate what would happen if you dropped the habit entirely. If you think that you would immediately go back to your old ways, keep loading. The purpose of the loading habit is to completely remove all associations with your old habit. Negative habits have specific triggers. Boredom might trigger wasting time online. When you wake up in the morning, that is a trigger for a habit. Use such a powerful reality of the human experience to our benefit. Without a proper trigger, a habit is just something you sometimes do. Meditating once in a while when it strikes your fancy is an inconsistent hobby. Meditating every single day when you wake up is a habit. Whenever you begin a new habit, you should think about what its trigger is going to be, and to commit to that. We're not adding more triggers to our days, we're just changing the actions they spur. Use habits as triggers for other habits, thus creating a reliable chain. Think about all of the things that absolutely must get done in a day, and work them into chains. The easiest habits should be loaded up front, and the most difficult ones should be last. This ensures that you maximize the benefit of momentum. Only quit habits when you no longer want to quit them. (For an excellent book by my favorite thinker on food, read Death by Food Pyramid by Denise Minger.) Create a habit of only hanging out with people who you want to become better friends with. Short term efforts to improve your environment can pay off big in the long term. By creating positive habits around how you react to external events, it feels like nothing bad ever happens to you. Remember that everyone is just doing their best and trying to be happy, just like you. The first step towards a good sleep habit is creating a good sleep environment. The key components of a good sleep environment are complete darkness and silence. Buy a sleep mask. Bucky 40 Blinks mask. Wear the mask every single night, even though you will just pull it off in your sleep for the first few weeks. Regulate your bedtime. Set a strict screens-off time one or two hours prior to your bedtime. If you meditate for five minutes a day, you will notice results within two months. Focus on the process and count it as a win any time you sit with your eyes closed, trying your best, for five minutes. If you love green tea, but want something new, try a light Taiwanese oolong. Take vitamin D every day. Take 10,000iu per day until you are no longer deficient then drop down to 5,000iu. Seek Out Masterpieces: A masterpiece is anything made by someone who is an expert in their craft. Scroll through your entire phone book. For each person you haven't contacted in the past month, or since the last check, force yourself to either delete them from your phone or send them a message or make a call. I routinely go through my Facebook friend list and delete people who I wouldn't want to go have dinner with. Twice, then Quit is very simple. When you want to quit working for the first time, don't. Push through and work some more. The second time you want to quit, also don't quit. Push through again. The third time you want to quit, go ahead and quit. The trigger for twice, then quit, should be feeling exhausted, being unable to focus on the work at hand, or feeling like you're not able to muster the effort towards creating high quality work. Plan When Stuck: leading cause of procrastination is simply not knowing what to do next. Whenever that happens, simply set a clock for thirty minutes, and begin planning.","Great little manifesto about habits. Very well thought-through practical applications, tips, and philosophies on creating and sustaining the habits you want."
The Obstacle Is the Way,Ryan Holiday,1591846358,8,"THE PATTERN IN EVERY ONE OF THE STORIES IN THIS BOOK: Something stands in someone’s way. They stare it down, they aren’t intimidated. Leaning into their problem or weakness or issue, they give everything they have, mentally and physically. Even though they did not always overcome it in the way they intended or expected, each individual emerged better, stronger. Have unflappable coolness under pressure. Keep your head while everyone else loses theirs. Resist impulse in favor of cold, hard common sense. when Hurricane Carter walked out of prison, he simply resumed his life. Carter did not even request an apology from the court. Because to him, that would imply that they’d taken something of his that he felt he was owed. There are always people out there looking to get you. They want to intimidate you. Rattle you. Pressure you into making a decision before you’ve gotten all the facts. They want you thinking and acting on their terms, not yours. When you worry, ask yourself, ‘What am I choosing to not see right now?’ The observing eye sees events, clear of distractions, exaggerations, and misperceptions. The perceiving eye sees “insurmountable obstacles” or “major setbacks” or even just “issues.” It brings its own issues to the fight. The former is helpful, the latter is not. Marcus Aurelius described glamorous or expensive things without their euphemisms - roasted meat is a dead animal and vintage wine is old, fermented grapes. The aim was to see these things as they really are, without any of the ornamentation. Take your situation and pretend it is not happening to you. How much easier would it be for you to know what to do? We often choose the ominous explanation over the simple one, to our detriment. Don't ignore fear, but explain it away. Everything changed for George Clooney when he tried a new perspective. He realized that casting is an obstacle for producers, too - they need to find somebody, and they’re all hoping that the next person to walk in the room is the right somebody. Auditions were a chance to solve their problem, not his. From Clooney’s new perspective, he was that solution. He wasn’t going to be someone groveling for a shot. He was someone with something special to offer. He was the answer to their prayers, not the other way around Socrates had a mean, nagging wife; he always said that being married to her was good practice for philosophy. The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity. The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this. Demosthenes locked himself away underground - literally - in a dugout he’d had built in which to study and educate himself. To ensure he wouldn’t indulge in outside distractions, he shaved half his head so he’d be too embarrassed to go outside. When he did venture out, it was to learn even more. Every moment, every conversation, every transaction, was an opportunity for him to improve We may be able to articulate a problem, even potential solutions, but then weeks, months, or sometimes years later, the problem is still there. Or it’s gotten worse. As though we expect someone else to handle it, as though we honestly believe that there is a chance of obstacles unobstacle-ing themselves. We’ve all done it. Said: “I am so [overwhelmed, tired, stressed, busy, blocked, outmatched].” And then what do we do about it? Go out and party. Or treat ourselves. Or sleep in. Or wait. It feels better to ignore or pretend. But you know deep down that that isn’t going to truly make it any better. You’ve got to act. While overpaid CEOs take long vacations and hide behind e-mail autoresponders, some programmer is working eighteen-hour days coding the start-up that will destroy that CEO’s business. While you’re sleeping, traveling, attending meetings, or messing around online, the same thing is happening to you. You’re going soft. You’re not aggressive enough. You’re not pressing ahead. You’ve got a million reasons why you can’t move at a faster pace. The process (path of the craftman) is about finishing. Finishing games. Finishing workouts. Finishing film sessions. Finishing drives. Finishing reps. Finishing plays. Finishing blocks. Finishing the smallest task you have right in front of you and finishing it well. Everything is a chance to do and be your best. Victor Frankl: “What is the meaning of life?” As though it is someone else’s responsibility to tell you. Instead, he said, the world is asking you that question. And it’s your job to answer with your actions. Right action - unselfish, dedicated, masterful, creative - that is the answer to that question. Two rival American fruit companies wanted to acquire the same five thousand acres of valuable land. Two different locals claimed to own the deed. United Fruit dispatched a team of high-powered lawyers. They set out in search of every file and scrap of paper in the country, ready to pay whatever it cost to win. The tiny, uneducated competitor just met separately with both of the supposed owners and bought the land from each of them. He paid twice, sure, but it was over. The land was his. Forget the rule book, settle the issue. Søren Kierkegaard would write under pseudonyms, where each fake personality would embody a different platform or perspective - writing multiple times on the same subject from multiple angles. He would rarely tell the reader “do this” or “think that.” Instead he would show new ways of looking at or understanding the world. External factors influence the path, but not the direction: forward. That which blocks our path actually presents a new path. If someone you love hurts you, there is a chance to practice forgiveness. If your business fails, now you can practice acceptance. Always prepare ourselves for more difficult times. The ancient philosophers.

The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking,Oliver Burkeman,0865478015,8,"The outcome we’re seeking to avoid is exactly the one to which we seem magnetically lured. Like not thinking about a white bear. Those who began the process with low self-esteem became appreciably less happy as a result of telling themselves that they were lovable. They didn’t feel particularly lovable to begin with – and trying to convince themselves otherwise merely solidified their negativity. ‘Positive thinking’ had made them feel worse. Stoicism, which was born in Greece and matured in Rome, should not be confused with ‘stoicism’ as the word is commonly used today – a weary, uncomplaining resignation. Real Stoicism involves developing a kind of muscular calm in the face of trying circumstances. Spending time and energy thinking about how well things could go actually reduces most people’s motivation to achieve them. They confused visualising success with having already achieved it. Switch to negative visualisation instead, and to start focusing on all the ways in which things could go wrong. Tranquility was to be achieved not by strenuously chasing after enjoyable experiences, but by cultivating a kind of calm indifference towards one’s circumstances. One way to do this, the Stoics argued, was by turning towards negative emotions and experiences; not shunning them, but examining them closely instead. Most of us, the Stoics point out, go through life under the delusion that it is certain people, situations, or events that make us sad, anxious, or angry. But nothing outside your own mind can properly be described as negative or positive at all. What actually causes suffering are the beliefs you hold about those things. What makes the prospect of starvation or exposure distressing in the first place? The beliefs that you hold about the disadvantages of death. One of the greatest enemies of human happiness is hedonic adaptation. Thinking about the possibility of losing something you value shifts it from the backdrop of your life back to centre stage, where it can deliver pleasure once more. Reassurance can actually exacerbate anxiety: when you reassure your friend that the worst-case scenario he fears probably won’t occur, you inadvertently reinforce his belief that it would be catastrophic if it did. If your strategy for happiness depends on bending circumstances to your will, this is terrible news: the best you can do is to pray that not all that much will go wrong and try to distract yourself when it does. A Stoic who finds herself in an abusive relationship would not be expected to put up with it, and would almost certainly be best advised to take action to leave it. It was all highly undesirable, but not horrific, and there was no point insisting that the entire universe fall in line with his wishes. Meditation has little to do with achieving any specific desired state of mind, no matter whether blissful or calm. To live non-attachedly is to feel impulses, think thoughts, and experience life without becoming hooked by mental narratives about how things ‘should’ be, or should never be, or should remain forever. The perfectly non-attached Buddhist would be simply, calmly present, and non-judgmentally aware. Clinging to a particular version of a happy life, while fighting to eliminate all possibility of an unhappy one, was the cause of the problem, not its solution. It wasn’t about escaping into ecstasy – or even into calmness, as the word is normally understood; and it certainly wasn’t about positive thinking. It was about the significantly greater challenge of declining to do any of that. ‘Groundlessness’ is actually everyone’s situation, all the time, whether they like it or not. It’s just that most of us can’t relax in the presence of that truth; instead, we frantically scramble to deny it. Sometimes you simply can’t make yourself feel like acting. Taking a non-attached stance: Who says you need to wait until you ‘feel like’ doing something in order to start doing it? Note the procrastinatory feelings and act anyway. Working routines of prolific authors and artists – people who really do get a lot done – very rarely include techniques for ‘getting motivated’. Quite the opposite: they tend to emphasise the mechanics of the working process. We can take action without changing our feeling-states. The Everest climbers had been lured into destruction by their passion for goals. The more they fixated on the endpoint, the more that goal became not just an external target but a part of their own identities. Negative evidence would be reinterpreted as a reason to invest more effort and resources in pursuit of the goal. And so things would go even more wrong. The Yale Study of Goals never took place. Faced with the anxiety of not knowing what the future holds, we invest ever more fiercely in our preferred vision of that future – not because it will help us achieve it, but because it helps rid us of feelings of uncertainty in the present. Consider any significant decision you’ve ever taken that you subsequently came to regret: you felt the gut-knotting ache of uncertainty; afterwards, having made a decision, did those feelings subside? If so, this points to the troubling possibility that your primary motivation in taking the decision wasn’t any rational consideration of its rightness for you, but simply the urgent need to get rid of your feelings of uncertainty. Like a frog: You should sun yourself on a lily-pad until you get bored; then, when the time is right, you should jump to a new lily-pad and hang out there for a while. Continue this over and over, moving in whatever direction feels right. The Matrix is essentially a twentieth-century meditation on Descartes’s seventeenth-century insights. There is no centre in the brain where things do all come together. We imagine that we are the chattering stream of thinking. Try asking yourself if you have any problems right now. The answer, unless you’re currently in physical pain, is very likely to be no. Most problems involve thoughts about how something might turn out badly in the future, or thoughts about things that happened in the past. Helping other people is a far more reliable strategy for happiness than focusing solely on yourself. For every outside, there is an inside, and that for every inside, there is an outside, and although they are different, they go together. The self is best thought of as some kind of a fiction, albeit an extremely useful one. A staggering proportion of human activity is motivated by the desire to feel safe and secure. In turning towards insecurity we may come to understand that security itself is a kind of illusion – and that we were mistaken, all along, about what it was we thought we were searching for. People have always believed that they are living in times of unique insecurity. Many of the ways in which we try to feel safe don’t ultimately make us happy. We protect ourselves from physical danger by moving to safer neighbourhoods, but the effects of such trends on community life have been demonstrated to have a negative effect on collective levels of happiness. We seek the fulfilment of strong romantic relationships and friendships, yet striving too hard to achieve security in such relationships stifles them. To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung, and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no-one. The more you try to avoid suffering, the more you suffer, because smaller and more insignificant things begin to torture you. Becoming a Buddhist is about becoming homeless. People living in extremely fragile circumstances seem surprisingly high-functioning and non-depressed. Money: if you don’t have it, it’s much harder to overinvest emotionally in it. The same goes for prestigious jobs, material possessions, or impressive educational qualifications. To seek security is to try to remove yourself from change, and thus from the thing that defines life. We build castle walls to keep out the enemy, but it is the building of the walls that causes the enemy to spring into existence in the first place. There is no security until we realize that this ‘I’ does not exist. Insecurity: it is another word for life. We will do anything to tell a success-based story of our lives. Successful entrepreneurs possess perseverance and leadership skills, of course. What is less obvious – and much less boring – is what the speaker neglected to mention: that those traits are likely to be the characteristics of extremely unsuccessful people, too. Our conversations about success are always falling foul of the undersampling of failure. You don’t hear speeches or read autobiographies by people who were unafraid of failure and then did indeed simply fail. The vulnerability revealed by failure can nurture empathy and communality. Reduce the terror induced by the mere thought of death. Fearing being dead yourself makes no sense. You don’t look back with horror at the eternal oblivion before you were born. Live a life suffused with the awareness of its own finitude, and you can hope to finish it in something like the fashion that Jean-Paul Sartre hoped to die: ‘quietly … certain that the last burst of my heart would be inscribed on the last page of my work, and that death would be taking only a dead man’. Imagine you are eighty. Complete the sentences ‘I wish I’d spent more time on…’ and ‘I wish I’d spent less time on…’. Imagining worst-case scenarios is one of my greatest sources of solace in life. -- REF: Albert Ellis, who did more than anyone else to restore Stoicism to the forefront of modern psychology.

Decisive,Chip and Dan Heath,0307956393,8,"This book will address decisions that take longer than five minutes to make. A remarkable aspect of your mental life is that you are rarely stumped. You have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way. Understanding our shortcomings is not enough to fix them. Does knowing you’re nearsighted help you see better? Beware of “Should I do this OR that?” instead, ask yourself, “Is there a way I can do this AND that?” The first villain of decision making, narrow framing, which is the tendency to define our choices too narrowly, to see them in binary terms. We ask, “Should I break up with my partner or not?” instead of “What are the ways I could make this relationship better?” We ask ourselves, “Should I buy a new car or not?” instead of “What’s the best way I could spend some money to make my family better off?” Two research studies headlined “Data That Supports What You Think” and “Data That Contradicts What You Think.” Guess which one gets cited? When doctors reckoned themselves “completely certain” about a diagnosis, they were wrong 40% of the time. When a group of students made estimates that they believed had only a 1% chance of being wrong, they were actually wrong 27% of the time. We have too much confidence in our own predictions. We can’t deactivate our biases, but we can counteract them. Intuition is only accurate in domains where it has been carefully trained. If you’re a chess grand master, you should trust your gut. If you’re a manager making a hiring decision, you shouldn’t. (You’ve probably hired only a small number of people over the years, and the feedback from those hires is delayed and often confounded by other factors.) Decisions don’t occupy much of our time, they have a disproportionate influence on our lives. In our cars, we may spend 95% of our time going straight, but it’s the turns that determine where we end up. Mergers and acquisitions: 83% of them did not boost shareholder value. Thinking of doing a merger? Don’t. Five times out of six you’ll be right! How managers make decisions: only 29% considered more than one alternative. Being exposed to even a weak hint of another alternative - you could buy something else with this money if you want - is sufficient to improve our purchasing decisions. (A) Buy this entertaining video. (B) Not buy this entertaining video. Keep the $14.99 for other purchases. Do we really need to remind people that they can use their money to buy things other than videos? The reminder almost doubled the chance that people would pass on the purchase! That phrase “whether or not” is, as we’ve seen, a classic warning signal that you haven’t explored all your options. When people imagine that they cannot have an option, they are forced to move their mental spotlight. Until we are forced to dig up a new option, we’re likely to stay fixated on the ones we already have. The name of the brush should signal lightness. He asked his network of linguists to brainstorm about metaphors. Adding one more alternative to your decision will substantially improve your decisions. Produce options that are meaningfully distinct. Poll colleagues for their preferences. If there’s disagreement, that’s a great sign that you have real options. An easy consensus may be a red flag. Common states of mind: Avoiding bad things, and pursuing good things. When we’re in one state, we tend to ignore the other. This blending of mindsets is as vital for our personal decisions as it is for organizational decisions. To generate new options, find someone else who’s solved your problem. Force yourself to consider prescribed questions, one at a time, to generate new options. A “canned” list of stimuli seems to spark fresh insights. It’s generative; it stops people from overlooking an option. (Don’t forget to shine your spotlight over here …) The average premium paid in an acquisition is 41%. The acquiring CEO is basically saying to the target CEO, “I can run your company at least 41% better than you can.” For every favorable article written in a major publication about the CEO, the acquisition premium paid went up by 4.8%. If you’re looking to sell your company, definitely call the person on the cover of Forbes. An antidote to hubris: disagreement. CEOs paid lower acquisition premiums when they had people around them who were more likely to challenge their thinking, Our “bubble” is not the boardroom; it’s the brain. The confirmation bias leads us to hunt for information that flatters our existing beliefs. Take each option, one at a time, and ask ourselves: What would have to be true for this option to be the right answer? Imagine a set of evidence that would persuade your to change your mind. What if our least favorite option were actually the best one? What data might convince us of that? “What problems does it have?” That prompted 89% of the sellers to come clean. Probing questions signal confidence and experience in the asker. What’s the most likely way I could fail to get the right information in this situation? Leaders always say, ‘I learned the most from my mistakes.’ Well, why leave the mistakes to serendipity? Why not take some control of the process and make mistakes that you’re most likely to learn from?” When you’re trying to gather good information and reality-test your ideas, go talk to an expert. An expert is simply someone who has more experience than you. Be careful what you ask them. Experts are pretty bad at predictions. But they are great at assessing base rates. In assessing our options, the best complement to the big picture is often a close-up. Anne Mulcahy, who as CEO of Xerox announced that executives, on a rotating basis, would have to serve as the customer officer of the day. The customer officer would have to deal with every customer complaint that came into corporate headquarters that day. Mulcahy said, “It keeps us in touch with the real world.” It made the stock four times more valuable. When we zoom out, we take the outside view, learning from the experiences of others who have made choices like the one we’re facing. When we zoom in, we take a close-up of the situation, looking for “color” that could inform our decision. Do both. A student, Steve, has decided to go to pharmacy school. Work in a pharmacy for a few weeks. Sounds obvious. Yet every year hordes of students enroll in graduate schools without ever having run an experiment like that: law students who’ve never spent a day in a law office and med students who’ve never spent time in a hospital or clinic. Ooching is a diagnostic, then, a way to reality-test your perceptions. Try it first. That diva-ish, “I just know in my gut” attitude is inside all of us. We won’t want to bother with ooching, because we think we know how things will unfold. Even the best forecasters did worse than a simple computation that takes the base rates and assumes that the trends from the past few years will continue. Experts with two decades of experience did no better than newbies. Experts who made more media appearances tended to be worse predictors. Experts with impeccable credentials underperform a dumb algorithm that merely assumes that what happened last year will happen again this year. Get out of the business of prediction altogether. One similarity among many entrepreneurs, she said, was an aversion to prediction. “If you give entrepreneurs data that has to do with the future, they just dismiss it.” 60% of Inc. 500 CEOs had not even written business plans before launching their companies. ”I don’t believe in market research. Somebody once told me that the only thing you need is a customer. Instead of asking all the questions, I’d try and make some sales.” Bill Gross: Had an idea for selling cars online. He hired a CEO for 90 days and gave him a mission: Sell one car. This preference for testing, rather than planning, was one of the most striking differences between entrepreneurs and corporate executives. Ooching has one big flaw: It’s lousy for situations that require commitment. Ooching, in short, should be used as a way to speed up the collection of trustworthy information, not as a way to slow down a decision that deserves our full commitment. Interviews are less predictive of job performance than work samples, job-knowledge tests, and peer ratings of past job performance. Why predict something we can test? Why guess when we can know? Committed to stick with his criteria, he started calling up car dealerships within a 20-mile radius. He’d beaten the high-pressure sales game by avoiding it altogether. Attain Distance Before Deciding. Think about our decisions on three different time frames: How will we feel about it 10 minutes from now? How about 10 months from now? How about 10 years from now? Short-term emotion isn’t always the enemy. 10/10/10: How will you feel about this decision 10 minutes from now? How will you feel about this decision 10 months from now? How will you feel about this decision 10 years from now? A 10/10/10 analysis simply ensures that short-term emotion isn’t the only voice at the table. The choice was clearer when students thought about their best friends than when they thought about themselves. Distance yielded clarity. When we’re giving advice, we find it easier to focus on the most important factors. But when we think about ourselves, we let complexity intrude. The advice we give others, then, has two big advantages: It naturally prioritizes the most important factors in the decision, and it downplays short-term emotions. What would I tell my best friend to do in this situation? She realized why she was stuck: It wasn’t just a job decision; it was a values decision. When you strip away all the rational mechanics of decision making - the generation of options, the weighing of information - what’s left at the core is emotion. What drives you? What kind of person do you aspire to be? They enshrined that priority, making it known to everyone in the organization, so that it could influence dozens or even hundreds of future decisions. It helped employees navigate decisions between two good options. (Is allowing medical residents on trips best for the patient? No, because they distract the visiting physicians.) Enshrine core priorities. If a customer drops a corn dog, should he offer a free replacement? (Is his top duty to ensure that the customer is satisfied or that the owner is profitable?) People rarely establish their priorities until they’re forced to. A more egotistical CEO might have simply said, “Here’s what I’ve decided.” Create a “stop-doing list.” List A contained the mission-critical tasks, and List B contained the things that were important but not core, “the dreary, repetitive stuff, such as chipping and painting.” After compiling the two lists, Captain Abrashoff declared war on List B. Set a timer that goes off once every hour, and when it beeps, we should ask ourselves, “Am I doing what I most need to be doing right now?” “Bookending,” which involves estimating two different scenarios: a dire scenario (the lower bookend), and a rosy scenario (the upper bookend). “The future is uncertain, so my investments can’t hinge on knowing the future. I look for situations where the bookends suggest that I can invest wisely without knowing exactly what the future holds.” Imagine the future “death” of a project and ask, “What killed it?” Once all the threats have been surfaced, the project team can Prepare to Be Wrong by adapting its plans to forestall as many of the negative scenarios as possible. Realistic job previews have been shown to reduce turnover even when they are given after the employee is hired. They’re helping all people cope better when they confront the inevitable difficulties of the role. Tripwires encourage risk taking by letting us carve out a “safe space” for experimentation. Let’s give the topiary-sculpture business a shot, but can we agree that we won’t invest more than $10,000 of our savings. Go for it, but if you don’t have a paying customer within three months... Signs of opportunity: a similar tripwire for “unexpected success” Coach her employees, “If you see people using our product in a way we haven’t anticipated, let’s talk about it.” Compromise can be valuable in itself, because it demonstrates that you’ve made use of diverse opinions, which is a way of limiting risk. Bargainers come to the table with different options, which helps the group dodge a narrow frame. Also, bargainers tend to act as devil’s advocates for each other, asking the disconfirming questions that people don’t always ask themselves. It might be watered-down only in the sense that the parts that were least likely to work have been removed. When you can articulate someone’s point of view better than they can, it’s de facto proof that you are really listening.

5 Elements of Effective Thinking,Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird,0691156662,8,"Understand fundamental ideas deeply. Don’t face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don’t know. Then see what’s missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notions. There are degrees to understanding (it’s not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success. Make mistakes: Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers - they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination. Raise questions: Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What’s the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible. Follow the flow of ideas: Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare - milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs. Change: The unchanging element is change - by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning. In any movie, play, or literary work, media scholars tell us how to determine who truly is the main character of the story - it’s the individual who, by the end, has changed the most. When you learn anything, go for depth and make it rock solid. Deep work on simple, basic ideas. Return to the basics repeatedly. When you look back after learning a complicated subject, the basics seem far simpler; however, those simple basics are a moving target. As you learn more, the fundamentals become at once simpler but also subtler, deeper, more nuanced, and more meaningful. Without referring to any outside sources, can you write a coherent, accurate, and comprehensive description of the foundations of the subject, or does your knowledge have gaps? Do you struggle to think of core examples? Do you fail to see the overall big picture that puts the pieces together? Great scientists, creative thinkers, and problem solvers do not solve hard problems head-on. When they are faced with a daunting question, they immediately and prudently admit defeat. They realize that there is no sense in wasting energy vainly grappling with complexity when, instead, they can productively grapple with simpler cases that will teach them how to deal with the complexity to come. When faced with a difficult issue or challenge, do something else. Focus entirely on solving a subproblem that you know you can successfully resolve. I realized my problem is not just procrastination but focus. Ah ha! So for ten minutes, I’ll turn off my computer and cell phone and spend that short uninterrupted time knowing there will be no distractions. Once I’ve made this little ten-minute practice a daily habit, I’ll revisit the larger challenge of time management. Step One: Identify and ignore all distracting features to isolate the essential core. Step Two: Analyze that central issue and apply those insights to the larger whole. There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality. Perform this exercise on yourself. What do you view as essential elements of you? I simply asked the artist, “Tell me one insight into painting.” The artist responded, “Shadows are the color of the sky.” Acknowledge what you actually see - no matter how mundane or obvious - rather than guess at what you think you are supposed to see. Be very clear about the foundations of your opinions. If you believe something only because another person - even a professor - told you it was so, then you should not view your understanding as rock solid. Regularly consider your opinions, beliefs, and knowledge, and subject them to the “How do I know?” test. A practice of spending one day assuming that quantum mechanics was true and following the implications of that perspective, and then spending the next day assuming that quantum mechanics was false and following the consequences of that view. By alternating his views, he was able to explore each alternative more objectively. Suppose we did include the phrase “black-and-white” before the existence of color photography. Select your own topic of study and attach an adjective that points out some feature that is limiting or taken for granted. If you can’t explain it, you don’t know it. Understanding simple things deeply means mastering the fundamental principles, ideas, and methods that then create a solid foundation on which you can build. Seeking the essential creates the core or skeleton that supports your understanding. Seeing what’s actually there without prejudice lets you develop a less biased understanding of your world. And seeing what’s missing helps you to identify the limits of your knowledge, to reveal new possibilities, and to create new solutions to complex problems. If you think, “I’m stuck and giving up. I know I can’t get it right,” then get it wrong. Once you make the mistake, you can ask, “Why is that wrong?” Now you’re back on track, tackling the original challenge. Students need to experience the arc of starting with failure and ending with success. It shifts the activity from trying to think of a correct solution, to the activity of correcting mistakes, which is often something you can do. Write a really bad draft and then look for problems and fix them. A man’s errors are his portals of discovery. - James Joyce Ask for another volunteer to present an erroneous solution to the same challenge, so the class can explore the reasons behind that defect. “I got an 80% that’s good enough and I’m moving on.” Bad idea. Learn from mistakes until you understand 100% before moving on. If you can’t get 100% on your last test (actual or metaphorical), then you’re not ready for your next exam. Look at a mistake not as a wrong answer, but instead as an opportunity to ask, “What is the question to which this is a correct answer?” Ask what you would do if there were no budgetary constraints whatsoever. Maybe some aspects of those unrealistic solutions will point the way toward a practical solution that you otherwise would never have even considered. Consider an issue or problem and now exaggerate some feature of it to a ridiculous extreme. Become your own Socrates. Asking uncomfortable core questions. Never pretend to know more than you do. If an exam is looming in your future, prepare by writing the test itself. Instead of asking whether there are questions, assume there are, and say, “Write down two questions.” Then randomly call on students to read their questions. Constantly engaged in asking yourself questions about what you are hearing, you will find that even boring lecturers become a bit more interesting. When someone else speaks, you need to be thought provoking! Questions about what is missing, what is assumed, what might be extended, or what is vague or unclear. “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.” - Peter Drucker Move forward on the project at a fast-forward speed that will surely generate a work that is subpar. Now consider that poor effort as your starting point: react to that work and start to improve and iterate. All the new ideas we have are, in fact, only tiny variations of what has been thought before. The novelties that appear strange to us today will be familiar, natural, and perhaps even beautiful to the next generation. “The time to work on a problem is after you’ve solved it.” - R. H. Bing Engage with that idea and extend it. The key is not to wonder whether the idea has extensions; it does. Your challenge is to find them. Starting with what is currently the best is often the ideal place to expect great improvements. See with fresh eyes the current world for what it is now. Knowing the history is certainly helpful, but not if we tend to see current solutions as summits. We must get in the habit of seeing each advance as putting us on the lower slope of a much higher peak that has yet to be scaled. The same is true of mastering skills at increasingly higher levels. Having toiled to get that far, you may think that it would be impossible to go yet further, or you may just feel worn out. But after you have reached one level, that is where you start. Take an essay you’ve written or a solution to an issue and create a different, better one. Assume there is a mistake or omission or missed opportunity in your work - there always is! Memorizing a smaller number of isolated facts is harder.

The Icarus Deception,Seth Godin,1591846072,8,"It’s far more dangerous to fly too low than too high, because it feels safe to fly low. We shortchange not only ourselves but also those who might benefit from our work. Figure out how to realign your comfort zone with today’s new safety zone, Most painters, it turns out, aren’t artists at all - they are safety-seeking copycats. Commit to the frightening work of flying blind, of taking a stand, and of making something new, complex, and vital. What’s scarce is trust, connection, and surprise. If your team is filled with people who work for the company, you’ll soon be defeated by tribes of people who work for a cause. It’s the bridges between people that generate value. Do you think we don’t need your art, or are you afraid to produce it? The time their employees spend with customers (and the loyalty and enthusiasm it generates) creates more value than does the machine in the factory. Success turns not on being the low-price leader but on being the high-trust leader. Industrialism brought hospitals and CD players and the Egg McMuffin. What could be bad about that? The change in culture went further than most expected. We have changed the very nature of our dreams. The industrialist needs you to dream about security and the benefits of compliance. The industrialist works to sell you on a cycle of consumption (which requires more compliance). And the industrialist benefits from our dream of moving up the corporate ladder, his ladder. Capitalism is driven by failure. Industrialization is about eliminating the risk of failure. “Too big to fail” is the goal of every industrialist, but “too big to fail” means that capitalism is no longer functioning. It’s now cheaper and more efficient to make edgy, amazing products for the weird edge cases than it is to push yet another average product onto the already overloaded average people in the middle. Better sorry than safe. ""Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves."" - Rainer Maria Rilke The Forbes 400: the lucky few who have won the corporate lottery. Like most lotteries, this is a loser’s game, with the odds against us. We can’t suddenly quit a job and then race to find a form of art that will pay off before the next mortgage payment is due. Creating art is a habit, one that we practice daily or hourly until we get good at it. What matters now: Trust Permission Remarkability Leadership Stories that spread Humanity: connection, compassion, and humility And here’s the thing: All six of these are the result of successful work by artists. Leadership puts the leader on the line. If you ask someone for the rule book on how to lead, you’re secretly wishing to be a manager. Leaders are vulnerable, not controlling, and they are taking us to a new place. We seek out human originality and caring. What we are drawn to is the vulnerability and transparency that bring us together. Our revolution is turning most business into show business. when they move from task to show, they are adding far more value than ever before. Connection requires emotional labor: a little more emotional labor is often worth a lot. The race to the bottom is lower prices, find cheaper labor. The other race is the race to the top, the opportunity to be the one they can’t live without. Delivering more for more. It’s not what you’ve got; it’s how brave you’re prepared to be. There are problems waiting to be solved, once you realize that you have all the tools and all the permission you need, then opportunities to contribute abound. Before the revolution: Virtually all musicians aren’t picked by a label and are invisible nonentities. Of those who are picked, 98 percent fail in the marketplace. Of the remaining 2 percent, less than half a percent ever receive a single royalty check as a result of their recorded music. Ever. So we have a world where the odds of being signed are close to zero and the odds of getting a check as a result of your sales, even if you are signed, is even closer to zero. After the revolution: A musician who sells two (two!) copies of a song on iTunes makes more money than she would have earned from a record label for selling an entire CD for seventeen dollars. There are more musicians making more music being heard by more people and earning more money than ever before. Now, multiply what happened to music by a million. Multiply it by consulting, coaching, and design. Multiply it by manufacturing, speaking, and nonprofits. Multiply it by whatever it is you care enough to do. That’s what after looks like. When she makes her own art on her own terms, two things happen: She unlocks her ability to make an impact, removing all the excuses between her current place and the art she wants to make. And she exposes herself, because now it’s her decision to perform, not the casting director’s. It’s her repertoire that’s being judged, not the dramaturge’s. We can unteach bravery and creativity and initiative. And that we have been doing just that. Sol LeWitt invented rules, algorithms, and instructions, and the craft of painting his work directly on the wall is handled by an uncredited painter. An artist is someone who does something for the first time, something that touches another. Who do you want your customers to become? Zappos turned its customers into people who demand a higher level of service to be satisfied. Amazon turned its customers into people who are restless with online stores that don’t work quite as well or quite as quickly. Henry Ford turned his customers from walkers into drivers. If your work is filled with the hope and longing for applause, it’s no longer your work - the dependence on approval has corrupted it, turned it into a process in which you are striving for ever more approval. Myths aren’t about gods. They are about us. They are about humans acting human but doing it while wearing the cloaks of gods. They’re about our favorite person, our best possible self. Myths are mirrors, paths to walk, and bars to be exceeded. We repeat them until they not only sound true but are true. One definition of propaganda: It benefits the teller, not the recipient. The feedback that comes from popularity becomes an addiction. How does the popular one stay popular? The cycle of short-term pleasing. Instead of standing up for things he believes in, he calculates what the audience wants to hear right now. Six Daily Habits for Artists Sit alone; sit quietly. Learn something new without any apparent practical benefit. Ask individuals for bold feedback; ignore what you hear from the crowd. Spend time encouraging other artists. Teach, with the intent of making change. Ship something that you created. If you owned a conference facility, what would you do with it? Of course, you could own it, at least a day at a time. If you could lead a tribe (customers, coworkers, fellow scientists), which tribe would you lead? The entrepreneur often needs an exit in sight. But the impresario takes what’s available and makes magic. Industrialists see the world as broken or fixed. Artists see the world as a series of projects to be built. The industrialist asks, “How can I use this to make gradual improvements in the systems I have?” The artist wonders, “How can I break this?” or “Is it interesting?” How do I get more? vs. How do I give more? Where is the map? vs. Where is the wilderness? Do I have enough money? vs. Have I made enough art? We don’t have a humility shortage We don’t have too many citizens actively sharing their best and most generous ideas We don’t have too many caring leaders eagerly building up dignity among their followers The rewards for creating art are not present at its creation. That’s because the art isn’t truly art until it has touched someone else. When your art fails, make better art. Fly closer to the sun. Become naked and vulnerable. Make a connection. It’s precisely the high-wire act of “this might not work” that makes original art worth doing. We make the art and then we get the feedback, but the art must happen first. If we’re in love with the feedback and trying to manipulate the applause we get, we’ll cease to make the art we’re capable of. Art is a commitment to a process and to a direction and to generosity, not to a result. The twenty-four-foot-high diving board: after that first jump, the deflowered leapers always do the same thing. They get out of the water, run to the steps, climb right back up, and do it again. Safety zone adjusted, comfort zone aligned. For now. And the opportunity is to make it a habit. Artists can’t afford to be fragile. It wasn’t unusual for writers like Trollope and Dickens to write forty or more books over a career - while keeping a day job. You sat down and you wrote and then you were done. Starting in the 1950s, though, when writing became godlike, when creating the great American novel had a lot of kamiwaza associated with it, the drinking started and so did the blocking. It was easier to talk about making art than it was to actually do it. We’re drawn to connect with people doing art. They are us at our best. It takes confidence and guts to intentionally create tension. In the connection economy, the fearful are disconnected. They are the ones who are punished, not by sinking but by being isolated. If you rely on external motivation to be your best self, then you will have ceded responsibility and authority to someone else. You will be judged by how well your boss does at motivating you, not based on who you are. Psychologist Angela Duckworth has outlined elements they call grit. PERSEVERANCE: because they believe they have no choice, not if they wish to be who they are. HARDINESS: then processes that event into something that will allow a bigger impact next time. RESILIENCE: turns every obstacle into a learning process AMBITION: Grit exists whether or not it leads to measurable external success. Grit is its own reward. COMMITMENT: Consciously set long-term goals that are difficult to attain and do not waver from these difficult goals, regardless of the presence of feedback. If you’ve sacrificed your long-term compass at the altar of instant feedback, you might enjoy some short-term achievement, but you’ve given up your grit. FLOW: swallowed up by our passion, focused beyond all reason, deep into something we care about. Blaming the system is soothing because it lets you off the hook. But why you were relying on the system in the first place? Artists never stop looking for the disturbing truth behind the facade. When reality arrives, they won’t be surprised, because they saw it coming. Sometimes they even encouraged it to come. My work is always about connecting with the audience, and that connection brings vulnerability with it. Here I am, I have to say. Here is what I think, not what someone else said, not what some study said. Willing to stand up in front of people and own what I have to say. “Don’t Fix Me; Love Me for What’s Broken” : When our friend shares a litany of problems and explains why he’s stuck, he’s not asking for a solution; he’s asking for empathy and understanding. But why won’t he try to fix his problems? Perhaps they have become a crutch, a companion, perhaps a best friend for him now. Why not lean forward and use every tool available to take the huge steps to actually go forward? Because forward is risky. When those in power want to ensure that the masses buy what they sell, they shame those who apparently can’t afford to buy what they need to fit in. Edmund Bergler, “the megalomaniac pleasure of creation produces a type of elation which cannot be compared with that experienced by other mortals.” The community responds to a courageous act by seeking to shame the courageous one. Shame is the soul killer. The artist, then, combines courage with a fierce willingness to refuse to accept shame. Make art that moves the audience of your choice. Only a self-negating artist reads his Amazon reviews and the Twitter feedback on his work. He will learn nothing and will amplify his lizard brain’s certainty of his worthlessness. With our true friends we let down our guard, set aside our armor, and open ourselves up. We’re vulnerable and trusting. In school we teach kids to earn high scores and to comply and to meet the standards of their teachers and parents. But what if those things aren’t part of your agenda? Reality TV offers us the dream of fame at the expense of our dignity. FOUR COMMON MISTAKES: Busy is the same as brave. A mentor is going to change your life. Waiting to get picked is the next step. There is a secret, and you will soon learn it. When I'm feeling the resistance, I’m thrilled because resistance is the shadow of art. No art, no resistance. Yves Klein photo: Notice where Klein is facing. This is not a man intent on self-harm. It is someone comfortable with the void, eager to see what he will discover. Once I realized that the cold sweat, the palpitations, the wily stalling, the insecurity, and the fear were part of making art, I was able to relax into my work. When the resistance shows up, I know that I’m winning. Not my fight against it, but my fight to make art. The resistance is not something to be avoided; it’s something to seek out. Effort is rarely correlated with how much the audience cares. The dangerous addiction is to keep expanding the audience until we find people who hate our work. And then our reflex is to listen to those people, to the haters, to the exclusion of those we sought to serve in the first place. “Make good art” is Neil Gaiman’s prescription for whatever ails you. If it’s not working, then make better art. If you don’t know how to make better art, learn. Train yourself to ship. Ship small art. Then ship medium art. Then ship world-changing, scary, change-your-underwear art. Quiet your cleverness. The trick isn’t coming up with an interpretation of events that allows you to maintain your worldview; it is to accept what happens without stopping to interpret it according to your biases. The ability to see the market and the technology and the talent as it is, instead of how you want it to be (or fear it to be), is one of the secret skills of the successful creator. When you’re wrong, the instinct is to blame the universe, not your worldview. We rarely want to surrender our framework for how things work or question our assumptions. The difficult part of seeing is setting aside what you’re sure you already know. When the Web was young, I was already an “expert.” You can’t accurately see until you abandon your worldview. Your worldview is incredibly useful in everyday life - it’s the set of assumptions, biases, and beliefs you bring to the interactions you have with the world, and it saves a lot of time. Because you don’t have to come to new conclusions after each interaction, it’s easier to process familiar inputs and easier to be consistent. But your worldview, by its nature, keeps you from seeing the world as it is. A lifetime spent noticing begins to turn into the ability to see what others can’t. Successful people are good at labeling people and situations and ideas. The problem with labels is that once they’re applied, it’s impossible to see what lies beneath. When the world changes, then, our labels cease to function and we’re blind to the opportunities. Artists learn to see all over again. They learn to forgo labels and bring the fresh instead. Art is the act of pointing a light at the darkness. If people are listening to or watching or buying something and you don’t get it, inquire as to why. Learn to see through their eyes. The goal is to have so many pattern rules and so many labels and be aware of so many worldviews that they swirl together and allow you to become naive all over again. To be naive is to abandon your hard-earned worldview. It means seeing the world without prejudice and accepting it as it is, as opposed to the way you’re expecting it to be. Everyone should learn to code. Once you know how to make something, it changes how you see things. Once you know how to assemble an electronic device, every computer seems a bit less mysterious. Once you know how to give a speech, you see things in the speeches others give. Learning how to make things turns you from a spectator into a participant. Useless Questions: What should I do next? The answers don’t matter. At all. You need the experience of repeated failure. You need the good taste to see your own work for what it is, and you earn that taste not only not by emulating those who made art before you but by failing, by repeatedly discovering what works and what doesn’t. Bob Dylan knows more about the history of American music than anyone you have ever met. Fred Wilson can describe the details of a thousand successful venture investments. This is an important foundation that makes it possible to do important work. You don’t understand how the system works. It’s far easier to whine about unfair power brokers and unethical double-dealers than it is to dive into the dynamics of how things are actually made and sold. They don’t speak the language; they are out of sync with what’s being bought, with what’s hot, with the needs of the audience with the power to pick them. Use more guts to find your blank slate. Robert Irwin carefully finishing the back of a painting. Successful writers, programmers, entrepreneurs, graphic artists: when they were younger, feeling the pain of being outsiders, have chosen to live a life of standing out, not fitting in. No one ever gets talker’s block. No one wakes up, discovers he has nothing to say, and sits quietly, for days or weeks, until the muse hits, until the moment is right, until all the craziness in his life has died down. The reason we don’t get talker’s block is that we’re in the habit of talking without a lot of concern for whether or not our inane blather will come back to haunt us. Talk is cheap. Talk is ephemeral. Talk can be easily denied. We talk poorly and then, eventually (or sometimes), we talk smart. We get better at talking precisely because we talk. We see what works and what doesn’t and, if we’re insightful, do more of what works. How can one get talker’s block after all this practice? Writer’s block isn’t hard to cure. Just write. Write poorly. Continue to write poorly, in public, until you can write better. Do it every day. Every single day. Not a diary, not fiction, but analysis. Clear, crisp, honest writing about what you see in the world. Or want to see. Or teach (in writing). Tell us how to do something. If you know you have to write something every single day, even a paragraph, you will improve your writing. The World’s Worst Boss is you. If you had a boss who wasted as much of your time as you do, she’d be fired. How often people choose to fail when they go out on their own. Hiding from the real work, the stuff you actually get paid to accomplish. If your work is to do art, then doing art is what you ought to be organizing your energy and your time around. Excuses aren’t welcome; the work (your work) that connects is all we are seeking. HIRE A VERSION OF YOURSELF: Find someone who does every checklist task you do, probably better than you do it. Take the part of your job you can describe in a manual, and hire someone to do it. Find something to do but to do it so well that it more than paid for the person you just hired to do your old job. Then you can spend all your time not just imagining a bigger, better future but also making it happen. If you didn’t have to spend your time in meetings and reacting to incoming, no one would be standing in the way of your ability to generate value and insight and forward motion. The people with more leverage than you don’t work any harder than you do. They’ve hired people to do that. No, the people with more leverage than you do are making better art. HIRE SOMEONE WHOM YOU CAN WORK FOR: Entrepreneurs often do this when they raise money from venture capitalists. The VCs end up on the board; they are the ones who demand quarterly results and who scour spreadsheets and corporate-strategy decks and then give their permission. Painters do this when they sign on with a gallery instead of selling their work directly to the public. Musicians do it when they give away all their rights to a record label The trade-off is that you will give up the freedom to decide what sort of art you’re going to make. -- People succeed with a breakthrough or the creation of connection then work hard to ensure that they never have to do it again. They turn one original restaurant into a chain of a hundred restaurants, ensuring that the insight and innovation will never have to be repeated. Our fear of having to do it again, means that we sign up for sequels, structure, and systems. Instead of aggressively pursuing the freedom to succeed or fail with the next thing, Get as many people as possible into one room. And then go somewhere else. Organize the talented. Connect the disconnected. Yves Klein said, “My paintings are only the ashes of my art.” For him, the creation of the work was the art, and the canvas or the photo or the fake newspaper was merely the souvenir. Art isn’t merely what Pollock put on the canvas; in some ways, the canvas is just the ashes of his art. This is why art is rarely for the masses. But that’s fine, because the masses matter less than they ever did before. The masses are interested in what’s popular, and the weird, the ones who get the joke, have more influence than ever in bringing ideas to them. Complaining is stupid. Either act or forget. - Stefan Sagmeister Yes, change your tactics, and often. Agility pays. But no, don’t give up your strategy of making art. Isn’t it interesting that we never say, “I am a broken arm” or “I am cancer”? We understand that these are things that happen to us; they are not who we are. And yet we say, “I am afraid,” and “I am a failure.” Of course, afraid isn’t who we are; afraid is something that happened to us. To reverse Descartes: You are. So think. A problem is a chance for you to do your best. - Duke Ellington The lizard’s tactics push you to fall in love with the impossible project, with the impossible dream, with the worthy but ultimately doomed mission. After all, if your quest is one that can’t possibly be achieved, how can anyone blame you for not achieving it? Infinite games are played for the privilege of playing. The purpose of an infinite game is to allow the other players to play better. The goal of your next move is to encourage your fellow game players to make their next moves even better. German word: funktionslust. It describes the love of doing something merely for the sake of doing it, not simply because it’s likely to work. Not because it’s his job but because he can. Artists play. We don’t analyze our return on investment or seek shortcuts. We are playing, not working, and the long way is often the best way to get to where we’re going, because sometimes we’re not going anywhere. You will never be able to contribute enough reassurance to the artist. Artists need significant reassurance that they have chosen a worthy path and that you have their back. Push the artist to be more committed, not less. Push for more focus and edge and weirdness, not less. The artist doesn’t need to be given an out to avoid making art. The artist doesn’t need reminders about reality or lawyers or regulations or even the rules of physics. The artist merely needs to be encouraged and cajoled and supported to make better art.","VERY interesting. Seth is moving from talking about business to talking about being an artist in the broad sense of anyone who creates (and ships!) something daring and new. I loved the distinction between the industrialist and the artist, as it helped me give a term for something I'd experienced: not being able to relate at all to those who just want to grow business for business' sake, whereas I always saw my business like a creative art project. The book stays very high-level, so don't look for “TO-DO” type tips."
So Good They Can't Ignore You,Cal Newport,1455509124,8,"How do people end up loving what they do? The narratives in this book are bound by a common thread: the importance of ability. The things that make a great job great, I discovered, are rare and valuable. If you want them in your working life, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return. In other words, you need to be good at something before you can expect a good job. Mastery by itself is not enough to guarantee happiness: The many examples of well-respected but miserable workaholics support this claim. The main thread of my argument moves beyond the mere acquisition of useful skills and into the subtle art of investing the career capital this generates into the right types of traits in your working life. He had reached the zenith of his passion-he could now properly call himself a Zen practitioner-and yet, he was not experiencing the undiluted peace and happiness that had populated his daydreams. ""The reality was, nothing had changed. I was exactly the same person, with the same worries and anxieties."" He believed, as many do, that the key to happiness is identifying your true calling and then chasing after it with all the courage you can muster. The path to happiness - at least as it concerns what you do for a living - is more complicated than simply answering the classic question ""What should I do with my life?"" When it comes to creating work you love, following your passion is not particularly useful advice. The conventional wisdom on career success - follow your passion - is seriously flawed. It not only fails to describe how most people actually end up with compelling careers, but for many people it can actually make things worse: leading to chronic job shifting and unrelenting angst. ""Follow your passion"" might just be terrible advice. If ""follow your passion"" is bad advice, what should I do instead? Passion is an epiphenomenon of a working life well lived. Don't follow your passion; rather, let it follow you in your quest to become so good that they can't ignore you. Move your focus away from finding the right work, toward working right, and eventually build a love for what you do. If a young Steve Jobs had taken his own advice and decided to only pursue work he loved, he would probably have been one of the Los Altos Zen Center's most popular teachers. But he didn't follow this simple advice. Apple Computer was decidedly not born out of passion, but instead was the result of a lucky break - a ""small-time"" scheme that unexpectedly took off. Ira Glass: ""In the movies there's this idea that you should just go for your dream, but I don't believe that. Things happen in stages. It takes time to get good at anything"" - the many years it took him to master radio to the point where he had interesting options. ""The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that's the hardest phase."" There are many complex reasons for workplace satisfaction, but the reductive notion of matching your job to a pre-existing passion is not among them. The strongest predictor of someone seeing their work as a calling is the number of years spent on the job. The more experience they have, the more likely they are to love their work. The happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do. Motivation requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs: - Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important - Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do - Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people Notice, scientists did not find ""matching work to pre-existing ability, interests, passions, or personality"" as being important for motivation. The passion hypothesis convinces people that somewhere there's a magic ""right"" job waiting for them, and that if they find it, they'll immediately recognize that this is the work they were meant to do. The problem, of course, is when they fail to find this certainty, bad things follow, such as chronic job-hopping and crippling self-doubt. The craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love. When you focus only on what your work offers you, it makes you hyperaware of what you don't like about it. The deep questions driving the passion mindset - ""Who am I?"" and ""What do truly love?""-are essentially impossible to confirm. ""Is this who I really am?"" and ""Do I love this?"" rarely reduce to a clear yes-or-no response. In other words, the passion mindset is almost guaranteed to keep you perpetually unhappy and confused There's something liberating about the craftsman mindset: It asks you to leave behind self-centered concerns about whether your job is ""just right,"" and instead put your head down and plug away at getting really damn good. No one owes you a great career, it argues; you need to earn it - and the process won't be easy. Put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can't ignore you. Regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer. The source of these performers' craftsman mindset is not some unquestionable inner passion, but instead something more pragmatic: It's what works in the entertainment business. As Mark Casstevens put it, ""the tape doesn't lie"": If you're a guitar player or a comedian, what you produce is basically all that matters. If you spend too much time focusing on whether or not you've found your true calling, the question will be rendered moot when you find yourself out of work. Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you'll build a compelling career. Adopt the craftsman mindset first and then the passion follows. If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset (""what can the world offer me?"") and instead adopt the craftsman mindset (""what can I offer the world?""). Traits That Define Great Work: - Creativity - Impact - Control These traits are rare. Most jobs don't offer their employees great creativity, impact, or control over what they do and how they do it. If you want something that's both rare and valuable, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return. When Steve Jobs walked into Byte Shop he was holding something that was literally rare and valuable: the circuit board for the Apple I, one of the more advanced personal computers in the fledging market at the time. The money from selling a hundred units of that original design gave Jobs more control in his career, but to get even more valuable traits in his working life, he needed to increase the value of what he had to offer. It's at this point that Jobs's ascent begins to accelerate. He takes on $250,000 in funding from Mark Markkula and works with Steve Wozniak to produce a new computer design that is unambiguously too good to be ignored. There were plenty of other engineers in the Bay Area's Homebrew Computer Club culture who could match Jobs's and Wozniak's technical skill, but Jobs had the insight to take on investment and to focus this technical energy toward producing a complete product. The result was the Apple II. Ira Glass started as an intern and then moved on to become a tape cutter for All Things Considered. He turned his focus on making his skills more rare and more valuable. He got the opportunity to host a few of his own segments on air. He began to win awards for his segments. ""The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that's the hardest phase,"" he said. The more experience you have, the more likely you are to love your work. The traits that define great work are rare and valuable. Supply and demand says you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. These rare and valuable skills are your career capital. The craftsman mindset leads to acquiring career capital. You need to get good in order to get good things in your working life, and the craftsman mindset is focused on achieving exactly this goal. To those enthralled by the myth of a true calling, there's nothing more heroic than trading comfort for passion. Courage culture: a growing community of authors and online commentators pushing the following idea: The biggest obstacle between you and work you love is a lack of courage to follow your dream. The downside of the passion mindset is that it strips away merit. Great work doesn't just require great courage, but also skills of great (and real) value. When she left her advertising career to start a yoga studio, not only did she discard the career capital acquired over many years in the marketing industry, but she transitioned into an unrelated field where she had almost no capital. Instead of fleeing the constraints of his current job, he began acquiring the career capital he'd need to buy himself out of them. As his ability grew, so did his options. He invested his capital to gain more autonomy, this time by starting his own fifteen-person shop: He started his own company with enough career capital to immediately thrive, and had a waiting list of clients. The traits that define great work are bought with career capital. Because of this, you don't have to worry about whether you've found your calling - most any work can become the foundation for a compelling career. But certain jobs are better suited for applying career-capital theory than others. Three Disqualifiers for Applying the Craftsman Mindset 1. The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable. 2. The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world. 3. The job forces you to work with people you really dislike. Most individuals who start as active professionals change their behavior and increase their performance for a limited time until they reach an acceptable level. Beyond this point, however, further improvements appear to be unpredictable. This learning is not done in isolation: You need to be constantly soliciting feedback from colleagues and professionals. Do projects where you'll be forced to show your work to others. The traits that Anders Ericsson defined as crucial for deliberate practice.: He stretched his abilities by taking on projects that were beyond his current comfort zone - up to three or four writing commissions concurrently, all the while holding down a day job! He then obsessively sought feedback, on everything-even if, looking back now, he's humiliated at the quality of scripts he was sending out. This is textbook deliberate practice: And it worked. When running his start-up, this feedback took the form of how much money came through the door. If he ran the company poorly, there would be no escaping this fact: His critique would arrive in the form of bankruptcy. A spreadsheet, which he uses to track how he spends every hour of every day. ""At the beginning of each week I figure out how much time I want to spend on different activities. I then track it so I can see how close I came to my targets."" THE FIVE HABITS OF A CRAFTSMAN 1: DECIDE WHAT CAPITAL MARKET YOU'RE IN Winner-take-all or auction. (Diverse collection of skills, or one killer skill.) Mistaking a winner-take-all for an auction market is common. (Hollywood is winner-take-all. Don't get job at National Lampoon thinking you're building skills.) Blogging in the advice space is winner-take-all. The only capital that matters is whether or not your posts compel the reader. (stop calculating your bounce rate and start focusing instead on saying something people really care about) Auction: There are many different types of career capital, and each person might generate their own unique collection. 2: IDENTIFY YOUR CAPITAL TYPE identify the specific type of capital to pursue. in a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: By definition, there's only one type of capital For an auction market, however, seek open gates: opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. Open gates get you farther faster. Think about skill acquisition like a freight train: Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing its track once it's moving is easy. In other words, it's hard to start from scratch in a new field. 3: DEFINE ""GOOD"" Clear goals. For a script writer, the definition of ""good"" was clear: his scripts being taken seriously. 4: STRETCH AND DESTROY Deliberate practice: the uncomfortable sensation in my head is best approximated as a physical strain, as if my neurons are physically re-forming into new configurations. 5: BE PATIENT Look years into the future for the payoff. It's less about paying attention to your main pursuit, and more about your willingness to ignore other pursuits that pop up along the way to distract you. Reject shiny new pursuits. You have to get good before you can expect good work. It's dangerous to pursue more control in your working life before you have career capital to offer in exchange. A hard truth of the real world: It's really hard to convince people to give you money. Just because you're committed to a certain lifestyle doesn't mean you'll find people who are committed to supporting you. Control that's acquired without career capital is not sustainable. She tried to obtain control without any capital to offer in return, and ended up with a mere shadow of real autonomy. Build up a decade's worth of relevant career capital before taking the dive into full-time farming. Do what people are willing to pay for. ""I didn't quit my day job until I was making more money with my music."" == ""We take the ideas we've inherited or that we've stumbled across, and we jigger them together into some new shape,"" he explained. The next big ideas in any field are found right beyond the current cutting edge, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combinations of existing ideas. A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough - it's an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field. If you want to identify a mission for your working life, therefore, you must first get to the cutting edge-the only place where these missions become visible. Sarah was trying to find a mission before she got to the cutting edge of her field. From her vantage point as a new graduate student, she was much too far from the cutting edge to have any hope of surveying the adjacent possible, and if she can't see the adjacent possible, she's not likely to identify a compelling new direction for her work. Sarah would have been better served by first mastering a promising niche, and only then turning her attention to seeking a mission. If you want a mission, you need to first acquire career capital. If you skip this step, you might end up with lots of enthusiasm but very little to show for it. Pardis decided to build a research career focused on her use of computational genetics to combat ancient diseases. She took a professorship at Harvard, finally ready to commit to a single focus in her working life. Advancing to the cutting edge in a field is an act of ""small"" thinking, requiring you to focus on a narrow collection of subjects for a potentially long time. Once you get to the cutting edge, however, and discover a mission in the adjacent possible, you must go after it with zeal: a ""big"" action. Once you have the career capital required to identify a mission, you must still figure out how to put the mission into practice. If you don't have a trusted strategy for making this leap from idea to execution, then like me and so many others, you'll probably avoid the leap altogether. Little bets: He tried releasing a DVD, filming a documentary, and putting together a film series for his students. The latter ended up the most promising, but Kirk couldn't have known this in advance. The important thing about little bets is that they're bite-sized. You try one. It takes a few months at most. It either succeeds or fails, but either way you get important feedback to guide your next steps. To maximize your chances of success, you should deploy small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback. Explore the specific avenues surrounding your general mission, looking for those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding results. The synthesis of Purple Cow and Passionate Programmer is that the best way to market yourself as a programmer is to create remarkable open-source software. There's an established infrastructure in this community for noticing and spreading the word about interesting projects. For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking. Pardis Sabeti's general mission was to use genetics to help fight infectious disease in Africa. This is a fine mission, but by itself it does not guarantee the type of fulfilling life Pardis leads. Lots of researchers share this mission, and are doing good, basic science, but don't have particularly compelling careers. Pardis, by contrast, pursued this mission by launching an arresting project: using powerful computers to seek out examples of humans evolving resistance to ancient diseases. If you want evidence of the remarkability of this approach, look no farther than the catchy headlines of the many articles: ""5 Questions for the Woman Who Tracks Our DNA Footprints"" , ""Picking up Evolution's Beat"", and ""Are We Still Evolving?"" This is a project that compels people to spread the word. It is a purple cow. Kirk French's general mission was to popularize modern archaeology. There are lots of non-remarkable ways to pursue this mission. Instead, Kirk decided to head straight into people's homes and use archaeological techniques to help them uncover the significance (if any) of family treasures. This approach is remarkable. His venue conducive to remarking was TV. Working right trumps finding the right work.","Shockingly smart thoughts about your career. A must-read for anyone who is not loving their work, wanting to quit their job, and follow their passion, or not sure what to do next. I'm recommending this many times a week to people who email me with these kinds of questions. Best book I've ever read on the subject.

Mastery,George Leonard,78212976,8,"Mastery is available to anyone willing to get on the path and stay on it. To take the master's journey, you have to practice diligently and hone your skills to attain new levels of competence, willing to spend more of your time on a plateau, to keep practicing even when you seem to be getting nowhere. Learning occurs in stages. When you can perform the task without making a special effort to think of its separate parts. Practice for the sake of practice itself. Love the plateau. MEET THE DABBLER, OBSESSIVE, AND THE HACKER: The dabbler loves the newness. Enthusiasm quickly wanes, with rationalizations. The dabbler might think of himself as an adventurer, a connoiseur of novelty, but he's probably the eternal kid. The obsessive finds himself on a plateau, and won't accept it. He redoubles his effort. He doesn't understand the necessity for periods of development on the plateau. The hacker is willing to stay on the plateau indefinitely. TV says our lives consist of one climax after another. Sports photography shows ""the thrill of victory / agony of defeat"". We're shown climactic moments, but mastery's true face is relaxed and serene. Man is a learning animal. KEY 1 : INSTRUCTION: The best thing you can do is to arrange for first-rate instruction. When you learn too easily, you're tempted not to work hard. The best horse may be the worst horse, and the worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever it is practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones. KEY 2 : PRACTICE: Practice is best conceived of as a noun, not as something you do, but as something you have, something you are. Anything you practice on a regular basis as an integral part of your life, not in order to gain something else, but for its own sake. Masters love to practice. KEY 3 : SURRENDER Surrender to your teacher and to the demands of your discipline. Surrender your proficiency to reach a higher level of proficiency. The essence of boredom is in the obsessive search for novelty. Surrender means there are no experts, only learners. KEY 4 : INTENTIONALITY Viseo-motor behavior rehearsal (VMBR) combines deep relaxation with vivid mental imaging of the skill to be learned. Every master is a master of vision. KEY 5 : THE EDGE Masters are dedicated to fundamentals. The paradox : masters challenge previous limits, take risks for higher performance, and even become obsessive in that pursuit. It's not either/or. It's both/and. Many people run to savor life. For those runners, the dangers of the sport are moot. They run as consenting adults, to press the edges of the possible. Julie Moss - in the Ironman - collapsed and started crawling across the finish line, and passed out. It was stupid and heroic. But what type of world would it be without such heroics? People such as Julie Moss run for all of us, re-affirming our humanity. But before you even consider playing this edge, there must be many years of instruction, practice, surrender, and intentionality. And afterwards? More training, more time on the plateau. The never-ending path again. == Backsliding is a universal experience. Everyone resists significant change. We tend to stay within narrow limits, and snap back when changed. This equilibrium is called homeostasis. It applies to psychological states as well as physical functioning. A national culture is held together by legislation, law, education, arts, sports, and a complex web of mores, prestige markers, and style that relies largely on the media as a national nervous system. The predominant function of this: the survival of things as they are. After 20 years without exercise, your body regards a sedentary life as normal. The beginning of change for the better is interpreted as a threat. Realizing your potential in almost anything can change you in many ways. You'll meet with homeostasis sooner or later. You might unknowingly sabotage your own best efforts, or get resistance from family. If you really do want to spend the time and effort, here are 5 guidelines: 1. Be aware of homeostasis. Expect resistance and backlash. Don't give up at the first sign of trouble. 2. Negotiate with your resistance, by using pain as a guide to performance. Play discontent, the inevitable escort of transformation. Keep pushing, but not without awareness to the warnings. Pushing your way through despite the warning signals increases the possibility of backsliding. 3. Develop a support system of other people who share the joys of the change you're making. 4. Regular practice - the path of mastery for its own sake. A stable base during the instability of change. 5. Dedicate to lifelong learning. The lifelong learner learned to deal with homeostasis, because he is doing it all the time. == A human is a machine that wears out from lack of use. We gain energy by using energy. The best remedy for physical weariness is 30 minutes of aerobic exercise. I don't want to be saved. I want to be spent! Watch an 18-month-old. This raw, unadulterated learning energy exploits everything he can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel. We adults are easily exhausted, so we say, ""Why can't you be still?"" We park the learner in front of the TV. Now the kid's as lethargic as we are. The conventional classroom - with kids forced to do the same thing at the same time - makes individual initiative and exploration nearly impossible. Albert Einstein said, ""It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by coercion and a sense of duty."" Set your priorities. To move in one direction, you must forgo all others. To choose one goal is to forsake other possible goals. Our generation has been raised on the idea of keeping your options open. But if you keep all your options open, you can't do a damned thing. Liberation comes through the acceptance of limits. You can't do everything, but you can do one thing, and then another, and another. There's nothing like the path of mastery to lead you to an energetic life. A regular practice not only elicits energy, but tames it. It's easy to get on the path of mastery. The real challenge lies in staying on it. Never marry a person who is not a friend of your excitement. Vanity; It's possible that the reason you got on the path of mastery was to look good. You have to look foolish, and take pratfalls. If you're always thinking about appearances, you can never attain concentration. Continuity of time and place can establish a rhythm that buoys you up, carries you along. Inconsistency makes everything more difficult. But don't use that as an excuse to quit. The path calls for flexibility of strategy and action. Mastery is not about perfection. It's a process. All those chores that we can't avoid: Reclaim the lost hours by making everything part of our practice. Maintain full awareness of each of your movements. Pay attention to the rest of your body. Go for efficiency, elegance, and grace in your motions. Stay wholly focused on the moment. Above all, don't hurry. All of life is seamless. The way we walk, talk to our children, study, or do our jobs. Nothing is commonplace. Nothing is in between. You are made of mostly unused potential. What if out of the infant's babble comes the syllable ""da"", then the father looks down sternly and says, ""No! That is wrong! It's dad-dy!"" Consider the learnings in life you've forfeited because other people have not allowed you to be playful, free, and foolish in the learning process. How often have you censored your spontaneity out of fear of being thought childish?","A description of the path to mastery in any field: to enjoy regular practice for its own sake, to push your capabilities but to accept the plateau, to surrender to the path and exercises your teacher gives you. Stay focused, not distracted like the dabbler, impatient like the obsessive, or complacent like the hacker."
The Little Book of Talent,Daniel Coyle,034553025X,8,"While the underlying neuroscience is fascinating and complex, it all adds up to the basic truth: Small actions, repeated over time, transform us. “Muscle memory” doesn’t really exist, because our muscles simply do what our brains tell them to do. Thus, the new science can be summed up as follows: You want to develop your talent? Build a better brain through intensive practice. Create the spark, and to use the fuel for deep practice. ####### TIP #1: STARE AT WHO YOU WANT TO BECOME Fill your vision with vivid images of your future self, and stare at them every day. Studies show that even a brief connection with a role model can vastly increase unconscious motivation. ####### TIP #2: SPEND FIFTEEN MINUTES A DAY ENGRAVING THE SKILL ON YOUR BRAIN Watch the skill being performed, closely and with great intensity, over and over, until you build a high-definition mental blueprint. The key to effective engraving is to create an intense connection: to watch and listen so closely that you can imagine the feeling of performing the skill. For physical skills, project yourself inside the performer’s body. Become aware of the movement, the rhythm; try to feel the interior shape of the moves. For mental skills, simulate the skill by re-creating the expert’s decision patterns. Chess players achieve this by replaying classic games, move by move Public speakers do it by regiving great speeches complete with original inflections Musicians cover their favorite songs Writers retype passages verbatim from great works ####### TIP #3: STEAL WITHOUT APOLOGY Look at every single performer better than you and see what they’ve got that you can use. Then make it your own. Everything from how to hit a high note to how to deal with a rowdy crowd. The younger members of musical families so often are also the most talented, because of this. Focus on specifics, not general impressions. Capture concrete facts. ####### TIP #4: BUY A NOTEBOOK Daily performance journal. Write stuff down and reflect on it. Results from today. Ideas for tomorrow. Goals for next week. ####### TIP #5: BE WILLING TO BE STUPID If a passerby can recognize a song, it’s being played too fast. ####### TIP #6: CHOOSE SPARTAN OVER LUXURIOUS Luxury is a motivational narcotic: It signals our unconscious minds to give less effort. It whispers, “Relax, you’ve made it.” Simple, humble spaces help focus attention on the deep-practice task at hand: reaching and repeating and struggling. ####### TIP #7: BEFORE YOU START, FIGURE OUT IF IT’S A HARD SKILL OR A SOFT SKILL Hard skills are about repeatable precision. Soft, high-flexibility skills are about being agile and interactive; about instantly recognizing patterns as they unfold and making smart, timely choices. The following three tips take this idea further, explaining the methods of deep practice that work best to develop each type of skill. ####### TIP #8: TO BUILD HARD SKILLS, WORK LIKE A CAREFUL CARPENTER Be careful, slow, and keenly attuned to errors. Make one simple move at a time, repeating and perfecting it before you move on. Pay attention to errors, and fix them. The Suzuki music instruction method does this. ####### TIP #9: TO BUILD SOFT SKILLS, PLAY LIKE A SKATEBOARDER Soft skills are the result of super-fast brain software recognizing patterns and responding in just the right way. Soft skills are built by playing and exploring inside challenging, ever-changing environments. These are places where you encounter different obstacles and respond to them over and over. Practice should be aggressive, curious, and experimental, always seeking new ways to challenge yourself. After each session ask yourself, What worked? What didn’t? And why? ####### TIP #10: HONOR THE HARD SKILLS Most talents are a combination of soft and hard skills. Prioritize the hard skills because in the long run they’re more important to your talent. ####### TIP #11: DON’T FALL FOR THE PRODIGY MYTH ####### TIP #12: FIVE WAYS TO PICK A HIGH-QUALITY TEACHER OR COACH 1) Avoid Someone Who Reminds You of a Courteous Waiter 2) Seek Someone Who Scares You a Little. Look for someone who: Watches you closely, is action-oriented, and is honest, sometimes unnervingly so. 3) Seek Someone Who Gives Short, Clear Directions 4) Seek Someone Who Loves Teaching Fundamentals 5) Other Things Being Equal, Pick the Older Person *** In the talent hotbeds I visited, practice was the big game, the center of their world, the main focus of their daily lives. The key to deep practice is to reach. This means to stretch yourself slightly beyond your current ability, spending time in the zone of difficulty called the sweet spot. It means embracing the power of repetition, so the action becomes fast and automatic. It means creating a practice space that enables you to reach and repeat, stay engaged, and improve your skills over time. *** ####### TIP #13: FIND THE SWEET SPOT Sensations: Frustration, difficulty, alertness to errors. You’re fully engaged in an intense struggle - as if you’re stretching with all your might for a nearly unreachable goal, brushing it with your fingertips, then reaching again. Percentage of Successful Attempts: 50–80 percent. Locating your sweet spot requires some creativity. Seek out ways to stretch yourself. Play on the edges of your competence. As Albert Einstein said, “One must develop an instinct for what one can just barely achieve through one’s greatest efforts.” If you tried your absolute hardest, what could you almost do? Mark the boundary of your current ability, and aim a little beyond it. That’s your spot. ####### TIP #14: TAKE OFF YOUR WATCH Deep practice is not measured in minutes or hours, but in the number of high-quality reaches and repetitions you make - basically, how many new connections you form in your brain. Instead of counting minutes or hours, count reaches and reps. Instead of saying, “I’m going to practice piano for twenty minutes,” tell yourself, “I’m going to do five intensive reps of that new song.” ####### TIP #15: BREAK EVERY MOVE DOWN INTO CHUNKS 1) What is the smallest single element of this skill that I can master? 2) What other chunks link to that chunk? Practice one chunk by itself until you’ve mastered it - then connect more chunks, one by one, See the whole thing. Break it down to its simplest elements. Put it back together. Repeat. ####### TIP #16: EACH DAY, TRY TO BUILD ONE PERFECT CHUNK Perfect - not just improve, not just “work on,” but get 100 percent consistently correct. ####### TIP #17: EMBRACE STRUGGLE The struggle and frustration you feel at the edges of your abilities - that uncomfortable burn of “almost, almost” - is the sensation of constructing new neural connections, ####### TIP #18: CHOOSE FIVE MINUTES A DAY OVER AN HOUR A WEEK The way our brains grow - incrementally, a little each day, even as we sleep. Daily practice, even for five minutes, nourishes this process, while more occasional practice forces your brain to play catch-up. ####### TIP #19: DON’T DO “DRILLS.” INSTEAD, PLAY SMALL, ADDICTIVE GAMES Skills improve faster when they’re looked at this way. If it can be counted, it can be turned into a game. ####### TIP #20: PRACTICE ALONE ####### TIP #21: THINK IN IMAGES Create a vivid image for each chunk you want to learn. ####### TIP #22: PAY ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU MAKE A MISTAKE A vital instant, 0.25 seconds after a mistake is made. ####### TIP #23: VISUALIZE THE WIRES OF YOUR BRAIN FORMING NEW CONNECTIONS ####### TIP #24: VISUALIZE THE WIRES OF YOUR BRAIN GETTING FASTER ####### TIP #25: SHRINK THE SPACE Poets and writers shrink the field by using restrictive meters to force themselves into a small creative form - such as with haiku and micro-writing exercises. Comedy writers use the 140-character arena of Twitter as a space to hone their skills. What’s the minimum space needed to make these reaches and reps? Where is extra space hindering fast and easy communication? ####### TIP #26: SLOW IT DOWN (EVEN SLOWER THAN YOU THINK) When we learn how to do something new, our immediate urge is to do it again, faster. ####### TIP #27: CLOSE YOUR EYES Closing your eyes is a swift way to nudge you to the edges of your ability, to get you into your sweet spot. It sweeps away distraction and engages your other senses to provide new feedback. It helps you engrave the blueprint of a task on your brain by making even a familiar skill seem strange and fresh. ####### TIP #28: MIME IT Removing everything except the essential action lets you focus on what matters most: making the right reach. ####### TIP #29: WHEN YOU GET IT RIGHT, MARK THE SPOT When you have your first perfect rep, freeze. Rewind the mental tape and play the move again in your mind. Memorize the feeling, the rhythm, the physical and mental sensations. The point is to mark this moment - this is the spot where you want to go again and again. This is not the finish - it’s the new starting line for perfecting the skill until it becomes automatic. ####### TIP #30: TAKE A NAP It helps strengthen the connections formed during practice and prepare the brain for the next session. ####### TIP #31: TO LEARN A NEW MOVE, EXAGGERATE IT Go too far so you can feel the outer edges of the move, and then work on building the skill with precision. ####### TIP #32: MAKE POSITIVE REACHES Reach for what you want to accomplish, not away from what you want to avoid. ####### TIP #33: TO LEARN FROM A BOOK, CLOSE THE BOOK Closing the book and writing a summary forces you to... ... figure out the key points (one set of reaches), ... process and organize those ideas so they make sense (more reaches) ... write them on the page (still more reaches, along with repetition). ####### TIP #34: USE THE SANDWICH TECHNIQUE 1. Make the correct move. 2. Make the incorrect move. 3. Make the correct move again. The goal is to reinforce the correct move and to put a spotlight on the mistake, ####### TIP #35: USE THE 3 × 10 TECHNIQUE Our brains make stronger connections when they’re stimulated three times with a rest period of ten minutes between each stimulation. To learn something most effectively, practice it three times, with ten-minute breaks between each rep. ####### TIP #36: INVENT DAILY TESTS What’s one key element of this skill? How can I isolate my accuracy or reliability, and measure it? How can I make it fun, quick, and repeatable, so I can track my progress? ####### TIP #37: TO CHOOSE THE BEST PRACTICE METHOD, USE THE R.E.P.S. GAUGE R: Reaching and Repeating Does the practice have you operating on the edge of your ability, reaching and repeating? E: Engagement Is the practice immersive? Does it command your attention? Does it use emotion to propel you toward a goal? P: Purposefulness Does the task directly connect to the skill you want to build? S: Strong, Speedy Feedback. Does the learner receive a stream of accurate information about his performance - where he succeeded and where he made mistakes? Pay attention to the design of your practice. Small changes in method can create large increases in learning velocity. ####### TIP #38: STOP BEFORE YOU’RE EXHAUSTED Fatigue slows brains. It triggers errors, lessens concentration, and leads to shortcuts that create bad habits. ####### TIP #39: PRACTICE IMMEDIATELY AFTER PERFORMANCE The mistakes are fresh in my mind. ####### TIP #40: JUST BEFORE SLEEP, WATCH A MENTAL MOVIE Play a movie of your idealized performance in your head. ####### TIP #41: END ON A POSITIVE NOTE A practice session should end like a good meal - with a small, sweet reward. ####### TIP #42: SIX WAYS TO BE A BETTER TEACHER OR COACH 1) Use the First Few Seconds to Connect on an Emotional Level. Effective teaching is built on trust. Before you can teach, you have to show that you care. 2) Avoid Giving Long Speeches - Instead, Deliver Vivid Chunks of Information. Short, targeted, customized messages to each student, one at a time. 3) Be Allergic to Mushy Language. All good teaching follows the same blueprint: Try this concrete thing. Now try this concrete thing. Now try combining them into this concrete thing. Communicate with precise nouns and numbers - things you can see and touch and measure - and avoid adjectives and adverbs, which don’t tell you precisely what to do. 4) Make a Scorecard for Learning. Pick a metric that measures the skill you want to develop, and start keeping track of it. Zappos ignored the usual scorecard and began tracking the occasions when their customer-service representatives went above and beyond the call of duty - “delivering wow,” 5) Maximize “Reachfulness” What kind of space will create the most reachful environment? How can you replace moments of passivity with moments of active learning? 6) Aim to Create Independent Learners ####### TIP #43: EMBRACE REPETITION Bruce Lee said, “I fear not the man who has practiced ten thousand kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick ten thousand times.” ####### TIP #44: HAVE A BLUE-COLLAR MIND-SET Get up in the morning and go to work every day, whether you feel like it or not. ####### TIP #45: FOR EVERY HOUR OF COMPETITION, SPEND FIVE HOURS PRACTICING ####### TIP #46: DON’T WASTE TIME TRYING TO BREAK BAD HABITS - INSTEAD, BUILD NEW ONES Ignore the bad habit and put your energy toward building a new habit that will override the old one. ####### TIP #47: TO LEARN IT MORE DEEPLY, TEACH IT This works because when you communicate a skill to someone, you come to understand it more deeply yourself. ####### TIP #48: GIVE A NEW SKILL A MINIMUM OF EIGHT WEEKS Don’t make judgments too early. Keep at it, even if you don’t feel immediate improvement. ####### TIP #49: WHEN YOU GET STUCK, MAKE A SHIFT The best way past a plateau is to jostle yourself beyond it; to change your practice method so you disrupt your autopilot and rebuild a faster, better circuit. One way to do this is to speed things up - to force yourself to do the task faster than you normally would. Or you can slow things down - going so slowly that you highlight previously undetected mistakes. Or you can do the task in reverse order, turn it inside out or upside down. ####### TIP #50: CULTIVATE YOUR GRIT https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/user/login?destination=node/465 Take the test","First he wrote The Talent Code, which I also highly recommend, then he distilled all that research about deliberate practice into 52 actionable tips. Amazing and inspiring, you can read the whole thing in 90 minutes, then get to work!"
The Developing World,Fredrik Härén,9197547077,8,"A developed person is just like a developed country: it tends to stop learning new things. When people like this come across a new idea, a new culture or a new product, their response tends to be, ‘I know everything worth knowing and as I don’t know anything about this, then why should I bother with it?’ You see, we humans have a habit of enjoying our success, but this enjoyment tends to make us stop and then we forget to move on.” Developed people define things as finished. Just as a young person can remind an old one how fascinating the world can be, so too must we in the developed world let the developing nations remind us of the value of retaining our curiosity. “Do you think that the younger generation will have an easier life than your generation?” Less than 10% said yes in Sweden, and in Germany only 5% answered positively. In India, for example, everyone put up their hands when I asked the same question – as they did in South Korea. In Sri Lanka, nearly everyone raised their hands while in China they put up both hands, stood up and started clapping. A country in which only a tenth of its young believe that their country will improve in the future, is a country without dreams. The purpose of this book is not to describe an absolute truth, but to get you, the reader, more curious about what is happening in the world, to make you more eager to implement the changes that you find necessary. By saying that we are developed, we are declaring that we are done developing. By saying that we are done developing, we think that we have reached our goal. When you reach your goal, you slow down. I had coffee with a young Art Director from Indonesia, who got her education in Singapore and then moved to Shanghai. I spoke with many entrepreneurs about everything from fish farming to MP3 players, and have had the honour of meeting fashion designers, journalists, PR managers, advertisers and many others. Cmune: a little software company founded by a Frenchman living in Beijing and an Australian in South Korea. In order to develop their software further, they then went out searching for extremely clever 3D developers. They eventually found a young man living in a small Tunisian village via an online community. Creative revolution is going on in many developing countries right now. Looking at the world from a different point of view lets you see things that you have never seen before. The world is gradually getting access to many more creative people. “We Indians don’t want your boring jobs, like sewing footballs or assembling cell phones. We want your fun jobs: your research jobs, your analytical jobs, your design assignments and your development departments. Thanks to the Internet, we can look at what you’re doing and compare it to what we’re doing, and we’ve suddenly realized that there isn’t such a great difference between you and us after all.” Just as a hungry person appreciates food more than someone who is full, people who have had limited access to information recognize the value of the Internet more than those who have had a lot of information at their fingertips for a while. He wants to “be a role model for other young Turkish people and show them that you can come from Turkey and still solve one of the world’s greatest problems.” The main task of a teacher is not to teach facts, but to encourage students to want to learn. “Teachers don’t get the horse to drink – they make the horse thirsty.” 17 million university students in 2,000 universities. The number of Chinese in higher education is five times higher than it was five years ago. China’s leaders realize that it is too expensive to import innovations from other countries, so that they are making an effort to develop their own instead. This concerted effort is known as ‘Zi Zhu Chuang Xin’ in Chinese, and can be freely translated as ‘self-owned innovation’. In 2005, China’s leader Hu Jintao announced to the nation that China was going to be ‘an innovative country’. Hu Jintao, China’s president, encourages the country to become ‘an innovation-oriented country within the next fifteen years’. The president encouraged state-owned companies to support innovation more and the country as a whole to become more open to its own culture as well as learning from others. He added that ‘profound social reform’ would be needed in order to transform China into an innovative country. Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan. Knowledge and Innovation Community, KIC, located in the north of Shanghai, in the same area as top university Fudan. 75 Creative Industry Parks in Shanghai alone. You might think that the world’s biggest digital arts festival takes place in London, Paris or New York – but you would be wrong. It is held in Shanghai. The Shanghai eArts Festival In Singapore, Chris Lee's design company is called The Asylum. Due to the fact that so many complained a few years ago that Singapore was so dull, he felt compelled to change this point of view. Consequently, he has spent a lot of his time on developing the creative atmosphere in Singapore. Once a month, he travels to another Asian metropolis. He stopped saying that he lives in Singapore and, instead, started telling people that he lives in Asia with his base in Singapore. Ten years ago approximately 90% of Koreans who went to the USA to study stayed on. Nowadays, nearly 90% return home once they finish their studies. In China, people who have travelled to the West and then come back home, are known as sea turtles because just like turtles, they return to the place of their birth 30-year-old Sheila Tiwan is a good example of an Indonesian sea turtle. She moved to Silicon Valley when she was only seven. She came back to Indonesia two years ago and today she manages her family company Carsurin, one of Indonesia’s largest independent inspection and consulting maritime companies and a Lloyd’s agent in Indonesia. When I asked her why she – a young, ambitious woman in the middle of her career – did not stay put in Silicon Valley, she answered happily, “Because the opportunities are here in Jakarta.” She went on to add that, although it may not be obvious that Jakarta can compete with Silicon Valley, if you stick around Indonesia for a while it is easier to discover the opportunities that exist there. According to her, young career people meet greater challenges; get more responsibility and more interesting work assignments faster if they use their skills in a developing country. In addition, she thought that the pace of life in the USA was too slow and that she was not allowed to try out her wings because she was too young. “In a developing market, you are thrown into the deep end and have to learn to swim fast. When you move from a chaotic but dynamic developing country to a developed one, your first, spontaneous reaction is, ‘Wow! Everything is so nice and comfortable here.’ After a while, most people get bored and go back home because everything is too structured; too perfect and complete.” This is why Sheila moved back to Indonesia. Four years ago 40% of the songs in the top charts in the Philippines came from the West: from artists like Britney Spears, Westlife and The Corrs. Two years ago, only 15% came from the West. The West has a tendency to underestimate the consequences of the growing creativity in developing lands. It will take countries like China and India a very long time to catch up with developed nations in terms of BNP per capita or whatever measurement you want to use. It would be foolish, though, to stare blindly at percentage differences among countries. By doing so, you are very likely to miss the actual changes that are going on. In Asia: Factory owners became rich by making products for companies in the West. “They’ve earned their first pot of gold. Now they want to earn their second pot, but this time they want to satisfy their egos.” Their main motivation this time round is not to earn money, but to develop. They want to have their own products, their own trademarks and launch their own enterprises that go on to become known for their strength and uniqueness. They no longer want to be just suppliers. This is why they need product developers, designers, marketing executives and other creative people who can help them make their visions become realities. They have the money and now they want to invest it. Suddenly, a new market has been created: a market for creative services in China. “The developed world comforts itself with fantasies about keeping the upper hand within the creative industries while many other jobs move. America still thinks that it is the centre of creativity, but this centre is shifting. The West just hasn’t realized it yet.” Amena from the innovation company ""What If"" in Shanghai has this to say, “It’s happening and we’re in the midst of it! You might have to look among the grassroots to see it, but change is there. Everywhere!” Similarities between the Internet boom of the 1990s and the expansion of creativity going on in developing countries. A lot of people in the developed world are making the same mistakes that many companies did when they were evaluating the Internet. “A lot of people from developed countries come to the developing world wearing their ‘developed country glasses’. They compare what we are doing with the way things are done back home and exclaim, “This sucks!” To take full advantage of what is going on in the world today, we will have to be a lot better at noticing changes, understanding their implications and implementing them more quickly. Let go of our prestige and become better at listening to what the people in developing countries have to teach us about the world right now. When I ask people in developing countries how long it is going to take before we can really see the big changes, I nearly always hear the same reply, “In five to ten years.” Most people say this with frustration as if this were just too long. “We can really see the changes and this means that we are getting our act together. It’s forcing us to become faster, better, more competitive – and more creative too. Our brains are working overtime. We’re very lucky to be in India right now.” “You underestimate the Asians and overestimate yourself. Overconfidence is bad.” Experienced Swedish entrepreneur Jan Staël von Holstein moved with the creative revolution in the West, from New York in the 1960s and 70s, via Italy to London when the revolution reached Europe. Now, at 60, he lives part-time in Shanghai because he wants to follow the creative development in China at close quarters. “The next creative revolution is going to happen in Shanghai or Beijing,” he claims. “In five or ten years’ time, history will repeat itself and in the future we will look back and see that sometime between 2010 and 2020 something new was created in Shanghai. It is impossible to say what it will be. It could be a new art form, an innovative technology or a new philosophy. We do not know what it will be - but it will blow us away.” South Korea is a country that refuses to let itself become ‘developed’. The country is the world’s tenth largest economy and a member of the OECD, and has an average wage that is 30% higher than that of Sweden, it still does not want to define itself as a developed country. South Korea has gone from being a poor, underdeveloped country to a rich and successful one in just one generation, he believes that this is why people still have the desire to develop. They have had mobile TV for years. They can use their cell phones to pay in shops. They are number one in the world when it comes to being connected via broadband and they have developed their economy faster than all the other major economies during the past 30 years. “Korea sees itself as Japan’s little brother and will never be happy until it has overtaken Japan. At the same time, the Koreans can feel China breathing down their necks – so this has also led to their realization that they can’t stand still. They still view themselves as small shrimp squeezed between the two whales that are China and Japan.” The result? A steadily increasing stream of creativity. The developed world is stuck in a narrow rut while South Korea continues to question how things have been, are being and should be done. The Indian fashion business is a good starting point if you want to understand the changes that are happening in developing countries. One advantage that the inhabitants of developing countries have is that in their world it is easier to have great dreams and to believe that they will become a reality. In a world that believes most things are yet to be done, then the possibilities there feel endless and obtainable. Paradoxically, the fact that we think we have an advantage in the developing world may turn out to be an advantage for the developing world. How can it be possible in India but not in, say, Sweden? The answer lies partly in the old infrastructure – or, should I say, in the lack of infrastructure. Very few shops in Sri Lanka have credit card readers and very few Sri Lankans have credit cards - yet many of them have mobile phones – so it was easier for Dialog to change their customers’ behaviour. You could say that, in this case, the lack of infrastructure made it possible to create a new one. By establishing a certain way of doing things that seems to work, there is a risk that you also set a working method in stone and miss a better way of doing things. Developing countries do not suffer from the classic ‘not invented here’ mentality because they have not yet invented that much. The creative revolution going on in South Africa right now. She points to Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela spent a large part of his 27 years in prison. “In a country where a political prisoner who spent nearly 30 years in jail can become president we have created the feeling that nothing is impossible. This feeling has led to a huge burst of energy.” This new-found freedom has boosted the creative confidence of the South Africans. “We went from being incredibly oppressed – just over a decade ago – to suddenly seeing the world open up to us. This has created an incredible feeling of can-do in the country.” When the political oppression stopped, a period of creative chaos followed, in which the new-found political freedom gave people the feeling of total creative freedom. Many of the ideas that arose at this time were too free in expression to be turned into commercial successes. They are now at the point where creative expression is liberating but controlled enough to be able to turn ideas into something useful. Combine that heady feeling of freedom about being able to do what you want with the feeling that you want to achieve things just because you can and then pair them up with the knowledge of the demands the international market places on them. We have lost the ability to take risks as we are just too afraid; paralyzed by a fear of the future, of things going wrong; and by the fear of losing what we already have. In a world that is obsessed by trying to identify and minimize risks, there is an even greater risk that you are making the mistake of focusing on the wrong things. You put a lot of energy and resources into trying to fix things that do not need fixing purely out of the fear of being criticized should something go wrong. The USA has turned into one of the most extreme examples of how much effort organizations and corporations put into minimizing risks instead of developing innovations. One of the main problems of too many rules is that people stop thinking. Chinese management is all about doing – not about planning actions. Arthur explained that managers should encourage employees to establish goals and know where they want to go, but not write long reports about how to get there. In India, everything is uncertain. Nothing is predictable. We are better at living with insecurity and this is part of our comfort zone, if you like. We embrace risk-taking in all its forms: using a new product, testing new technology, trying out new ways of teaching or starting up a new venture. We have gone from being afraid of taking risks to a nation full of gutsy people willing to dare more. The last two hundred years in China’s history, when they have not been considered to be one of the major global economies, is referred to by the Chinese as ‘the little dip’. The Chinese know their history, and they know that they have been one of the world’s superpowers for much of it. They are convinced that they will soon be a power to be reckoned with again in the near future. “It’s our turn now.” People in the developed world are surprisingly indifferent to what is going on in the parts of the world that are not ‘their own’. She was shocked by how uninterested Swedes were about what was going on in other parts of the world. Swedes are living in our own little bubble. Our lack of interest constantly diminishes us. Here we are in an isolated corner of the world, and we’re going to end up without access to a richer life. If you live in a developed culture, you think you are right all the time because that is the information the media feeds you with. Westerners think that the most exciting ideas can only come from their part of the world. One of the greatest advantages that the people in developing countries have compared to those in developed countries is the fact that they know about ‘our’ part of the world as well as theirs. This leads to a greater understanding of what is going on in the whole of the world, which means that they have access to more ideas that they can combine in new ways. How much does a European or American know about Asia, for example? How many Asian trendsetters can they name? How many designers, leaders or entrepreneurs do they know? How many artists, writers or company managers are they familiar with? And can they even name the leaders of China and India? Can they give me the name of just one living Bollywood star? Usually they can not. ‘They’ – people from developing countries – are more widely exposed to everything from new ideas and thoughts to products and trends than ‘we’ – people from developed countries – are. A greater exposure to all sorts of thoughts, cultures and experiences creates a good breeding-ground for the explosion of new ideas and innovations. They have both their eyes open, whereas we only view the world with one. “I know that a Frenchman has wine in his fridge, but he doesn’t know what I keep in mine,” she told me. “This means that I can design fridges for the French, but they can’t design one for me.” “Without longing, we are lost.” Copy Tigers – very large and strong Copy Cats The ability to emulate a master is regarded as a good thing in many Asian cultures. Trying to imitate a master is a form of appreciation and respect. By copying, you are in effect saying, “Master! You have managed to do something in the best way possible, and by copying you, I hope to become a master myself one day.” “Many Westerners think that all the Chinese can do is copy and that we in the West are creative. This kind of thinking is dangerous.” We have to learn to copy more – in the sense of looking at what others have done and learning from them. The Chinese travelled around the world searching for the ‘best small town in the world’ and they found Sigtuna in Sweden. Nowadays, 30,000 Chinese live in a newly built copy of Sigtuna on the outskirts of Shanghai. By studying how other countries have created successful communities, the Chinese built up a knowledge bank. They can then extract ideas from this bank and develop them into their own innovative solutions. “All you talk about is Copyright, instead you have to learn how to copy right.” China is the world’s largest user of solar-powered water heaters, has the largest growth within wind power, is the world’s biggest producer of hydraulic power and is a global leader in the field of solar panels. Operators in developing countries have an advantage because their customers do not know what to expect and, therefore, their expectations of such services are not that high. If you read about that same earthquake in a newspaper, you will never have the same understanding and insight, of course, as someone who was actually on the scene at the time. The same thing applies to the changes that are going on in developing countries right now. “I never plan,” said Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.com. If two people compete in a race and one is planning to get up out of bed and put his shoes on while the other is already running, then the person running will come first. Those who see themselves as upstarts or challengers are the ones who find it easiest to make these changes. “We are not a big fish in a small lake. We are a slightly larger fish in the big sea.” The East is speeding up so much faster. Everyone wants to do something new here. Everyone wants to create the next big trend. This creates a lot of energy and this energy is infectious. “Chinese are interested in knowing more about developed countries like those in Europe or the USA. But have we paid enough attention to Russia? Are we learning all we can from Brazil, Vietnam, Nigeria and Egypt? Can we learn something from them? Of course we can! Have we done so? No, we haven’t!” “We Koreans are really good at doing things quickly. We might not have the perfect strategy, but we still win because we are much faster.” Launching a product that is good enough to be launched and sacrificing the time it would have taken to produce a perfect product in order to get it out on the market more quickly. Creativity consultant and author, Dilip Mukerjea from Singapore, defines a developing person like this: “A developing person feels fear and hesitation, but marches forward anyway. She feels a sense of wonder, and has the courage to fail. This person is never satisfied. She isn’t starving but she is always hungry for more.” Dilip himself could have been the role model for this description. He reads ten books a week, has written many books himself, and travels around Asia giving lectures about creativity. Michelangelo once said: “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” The Icelandic word heimskur. It is a concept that means idiot. The word supposedly comes from the Viking age. A heimskur was a Viking who had never left his home to embark on journeys to foreign countries and who, therefore, missed out on new ways of thinking about how things could be done. In the eyes of the Icelandic Vikings, you became an idiot by just sitting around at home, believing that you already knew how things could be done in the best way. By staying at home, you end up not daring to try new things You teach. I learn. You try to protect what you have got. I am determined to get what is mine.","This is a wonderfully one-sided book that shows how exciting the big growth of China, India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, and Korea are. He's found great examples of people and companies doing really innovative things, but most of all it's a mindset."
Willpower,Roy Baumeister and John Tierney,1594203075,8,"Two traits that consistently predict “positive outcomes” in life: intelligence and self-control. Most major problems, personal and social, center on failure of self-control. When people were asked about their failings, a lack of self-control was at the top of the list. 1. You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. 2. You use the same stock of willpower for all manner of tasks. People spend about a quarter of their waking hours resisting desires: urge to eat urge to sleep urge for leisure, like taking a break from work by doing a puzzle or game Sexual urges urges for other kinds of interactions, like checking e-mail and social-networking sites, surfing the Web, listening to music, or watching television. Will is to be found in connecting units across time. Will involves treating the current situation as part of a general pattern. Smoking one cigarette will not jeopardize your health. Taking heroin once will not make you addicted. One piece of cake won’t make you fat, and skipping one assignment won’t ruin your career. But in order to stay healthy and employed, you must treat (almost) every episode as a reflection of the general need to resist these temptations. Self-control lets you relax because it removes stress and enables you to conserve willpower for the important challenges. They’d successfully resisted the temptation of the cookies and the chocolates, but the effort left them with less energy to tackle the puzzles. Why marriages were going bad just when stress at work was at its worst: People were using up all their willpower on the job. They gave at the office - and their home suffered. Muscle pain: the natural impulse is to relax, but you can will yourself to keep squeezing - unless your mind has been too busy suppressing other feelings. Brain region known as the anterior cingulate cortex watches for mismatches between what you are doing and what you intended to do. Ego depletion causes a slowdown in the anterior cingulate cortex. As the brain slows down and its error-detection ability deteriorates, people have trouble controlling their reactions. Depleted persons react more strongly to all kinds of things. Desires intensified along with feelings. If you’d like some advance warning of trouble, look not for a single symptom but rather for a change in the overall intensity of your feelings. If you find yourself especially bothered by frustrating events, or saddened by unpleasant thoughts, or even happier about some good news - then maybe it’s because your brain’s circuits aren’t controlling emotions as well as usual. Ego depletion thus creates a double whammy: Your willpower is diminished and your cravings feel stronger than ever. They simply stopped worrying about unhealthy, fattening food when they were focused on exams. There’s a common misperception that stress causes those kinds of emotions. What stress really does, though, is deplete willpower, which diminishes your ability to control those emotions. Before testing people’s perseverance, he informed them that they could win money by doing well. The cash worked wonders. People immediately found reserves to perform well. Since they hadn’t been warned ahead of time, they hadn’t conserved any energy, and it showed in their exceptionally bad performances. In fact, the better they had done in the second round, the worse they did in the third round. unrelated activities - resisting chocolate and working on geometry puzzles - drew on the same source of energy, There are hidden connections among the wildly different things you do all day. You use the same supply of willpower to deal with frustrating traffic, tempting food, annoying colleagues, demanding bosses, pouting children. People often conserve their willpower by seeking not the fullest or best answer but rather a predetermined conclusion. Theologians and believers filter the world to remain consistent with the nonnegotiable principles of their faith. Focus on one project at a time. If you set more than one self-improvement goal, you may succeed for a while by drawing on reserves to power through, but that just leaves you more depleted and more prone to serious mistakes later. When people have to make a big change in their lives, their efforts are undermined if they are trying to make other changes as well. Because you have only one supply of willpower, the different New Year’s resolutions all compete with one another. Each time you try to follow one, you reduce your capacity for all the others. A better plan is to make one resolution and stick to it. That’s challenge enough. Thinking requires plentiful glucose in the bloodstream. The diet sweetener didn’t furnish any glucose. Sugar gave them a quick burst of glucose. A sugar spike is promptly followed by a crash that leaves you feeling more depleted, so it’s not a good long-term strategy. No glucose, no willpower: Ego depletion shifts activity from one part of the brain to another. Your brain does not stop working when glucose is low. It stops doing some things and starts doing others. Don’t skimp on calories when you’re trying to deal with more serious problems. When you eat, go for the slow burn. The body converts just about all sorts of food into glucose, but at different rates. Foods that are converted quickly are said to have a high glycemic index. These include starchy carbohydrates like white bread, potatoes, white rice, and plenty of offerings on snack racks and fast-food counters. Eating them produces boom-and-bust cycles, leaving you short on glucose and self-control - and too often unable to resist the body’s craving for quick hits. You’re better off eating foods with a low glycemic index: most vegetables, nuts (like peanuts and cashews), many raw fruits (like apples, blueberries, and pears), cheese, fish, meat, olive oil, and other “good” fats. When you’re sick, save your glucose for your immune system. Your immune system is using so much of your glucose to fight the cold that there’s not enough left for the brain. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair the processing of glucose. The first step in self-control is to set a clear goal. The problem is not a lack of goals but rather too many of them. An executive’s daily to-do list for Monday often contains more work than could be done the entire week. The more competing demands you face, the more time you spend contemplating these demands. You’re beset by rumination: People who think more about their goals replace action with rumination. People with clear, unconflicting goals tended to forge ahead and make progress, but the rest were so busy worrying that they got stuck. People with conflicting goals reported fewer positive emotions, more negative emotions, and more depression and anxiety. Finish a story that begins with these words: After awakening, Bill began to think about his future. In general he expected to _____ Joe is having a cup of coffee in a restaurant. He’s thinking of the time to come when _______ When Joe sat in the coffee shop thinking of the “time to come,” that time typically covered about a week in the stories from the control group, but in the heroin addicts’ stories it covered only an hour. When the control group wrote about “the future” for Bill, they tended to mention long-term aspirations, like earning a promotion at work or getting married, while the addicts wrote about upcoming events, like a doctor’s appointment or a visit with relatives. The typical person in the control group contemplated the future over four and a half years, while the typical addict’s vision of the future extended only nine days. Another drawback of daily plans is that they lack flexibility. They deprive the person of the chance to make choices along the way, so the person feels locked into a rigid and grinding sequence of tasks. Life rarely goes exactly according to plan, and so the daily plans can be demoralizing as soon as you fall off schedule. With a monthly plan, you can make adjustments. If a delay arises one day, your plan is still intact. Agreements you make with yourself: When you make an agreement and you don’t keep it, you undermine your own self-trust. The waiter explained that he remembered each order only until it was served. The Zeigarnik effect: Uncompleted tasks and unmet goals tend to pop into one’s mind. Once the task is completed and the goal reached, however, this stream of reminders comes to a stop. (Stupid songs stuck in your head:) That’s why this kind of ear worm is so often an awful tune rather than a pleasant one. We’re more likely to turn off the bad one in midsong, so it’s the one that returns to haunt us. The unconscious is asking the conscious mind to make a plan. The unconscious mind apparently can’t do this on its own, so it nags the conscious mind to make a plan with specifics like time, place, and opportunity. Once the plan is formed, the unconscious can stop nagging the conscious mind with reminders. Once you make that plan - once you put the meeting memo in the tickler file for Wednesday, once you specify the very next action to be taken on the project - you can relax. You don’t have to finish the job right away. There’s nothing worse than sitting down to write when you’ve got a blinking phone and a pile of letters and a ton of e-mails in your face. You’re not going to do your very best work. But if you know the other stuff is taken care of, you can concentrate on your writing. You can be more creative. Decision making depletes your willpower, and once your willpower is depleted, you’re less able to make decisions. Some students choose double majors in college not because they’re trying to prove something or because they have some grand plan for a career integrating, say, political science and biology. Rather, they just can’t bring themselves to say no to either option. To choose a single major is to pronounce judgment on the other and kill it off, and there’s abundant research showing that people have a hard time giving up options, even when the options aren’t doing them any good. At the online dating service, customers filled out an extensive questionnaire about their attributes. In theory, that detailed profile should have helped people find just the right mate, but in practice it produced so much information and so many choices that people became absurdly picky. Because the online seekers have so many choices, they just go on browsing. When you have all these criteria to consider, and so many people to choose from, you start striving for perfection. You don’t want to settle for someone who’s not ideal in height, age, religion, and forty-five other dimensions. Closing a door on an option is experienced as a loss, and people are willing to pay a price to avoid the emotion of loss. Sometimes that makes sense, but too often we’re so eager to keep options open that we don’t see the long-term price that we’re paying - or that others are paying. Men who saw photos of hot women shifted toward getting an immediate reward instead of waiting for a larger payoff in the future. Apparently, the sight of an attractive woman makes men want cash right away. They focus on the present rather than the future. Self-awareness evolved because it helps self-regulation. If the people could see themselves in the mirror, they were more likely to follow their own inner values instead of following someone else’s orders. Anthony Trollope believed it unnecessary - and inadvisable - to write for more than three hours a day. He became one of the greatest and most prolific novelists in history while holding a full-time job with the British Post Office. He would rise at five-thirty, fortify himself with coffee, and spend a half hour reading the previous day’s work to get himself in the right voice. Then he would write for two and a half hours, monitoring the time with a watch placed on the table. He forced himself to produce one page of 250 words every quarter hour. At this rate he could produce 2,500 words by breakfast. He didn’t expect to do so every single day - sometimes there were business obligations or fox hunts - but he made sure each week to meet a goal. For each of his novels, he would draw up a working schedule, typically planning for 10,000 words a week, and then keep a diary. Nothing surely is so potent as a law that may not be disobeyed. It has the force of the water drop that hollows the stone. A small daily task will beat the labours of a spasmodic Hercules. That little diary, with its dates and ruled spaces, its record that must be seen, its daily, weekly demand upon my industry, has done all that for me. The Quantified Self movement: Instead of paying doctors and hospitals to repair your body, you can monitor yourself to avoid illness. Instead of heeding marketers’ offerings of fast foods and instant pleasures, you can set up your life so that you’re bombarded with messages promoting health. She’s monitoring herself with new electronic sensors like the Fitbit clip, the BodyMedia armband, and the Zeo “sleep coach” headband. By measuring her movements, her skin temperature and moisture, and her brain waves, these sensors tell her exactly how much energy she expends during the day and how many hours of good sleep she gets at night. If I’m at a party in the evening, I’ll tell myself that if I leave now, I could go to bed at nine-thirty instead of ten-thirty, and I’d get more sleep, and my sleep number would look better in the morning. In many ways, it frees me to do the right thing because I can blame my behavior on the numbers. For contentment, it pays to look at how far you’ve come. To stoke motivation and ambition, focus instead on the road ahead. Public information has more impact than private information. People care more about what other people know about them than about what they know about themselves. A failure, a slipup, a lapse in self-control can be swept under the carpet pretty easily if you’re the only one who knows about it. You can rationalize it or just plain ignore it. But if other people know about it, it’s harder to dismiss. Getting your brain wired into little goals and achieving them, that helps you achieve the bigger things you shouldn’t be able to do. It’s always making things more difficult than they should be, and never falling short, so that you have that extra reserve, that tank, so you know you can always go further than your goal. For me that’s what discipline is. It’s repetition and practice. The best results came from the group working on posture. That tiresome old advice - “Sit up straight!” - was more useful than anyone had imagined. By overriding their habit of slouching, the students strengthened their willpower and did better at tasks that had nothing to do with posture. Thanks to the students’ posture exercises, their willpower didn’t get depleted as quickly as before, so they had more stamina for other tasks. The key is to concentrate on changing a habitual behavior. One simple way to start is by using a different hand for routine tasks. Many habits are linked to your dominant hand. Right-handed people, in particular, tend to use their right hands for all sorts of things without giving the matter the slightest thought. Making yourself switch to your left hand is thus an exercise in self-control. Another training strategy is to change your speech habits. Exercising self-control in one area seemed to improve all areas of life. You might think that people who start doing physical workouts would naturally start eating better, but in fact the reverse has often been observed in other studies: Once you start exercising, you feel virtuous and therefore entitled to reward yourself with high-calorie treats. (That’s an example of the “licensing effect,” when you act as if one good deed gives you license to sin.) Stanley: The Impossible Life of Africa’s Greatest Explorer. By creating the public persona of himself as Bula Matari, the unyielding Breaker of Rocks, he forced himself to live up to it. As a result of his oaths and his image, Jeal said, “Stanley made it impossible in advance to fail through weakness of will.” I mean by attention to my business, by self-denial, by indefatigable energy, to become, by this very business, my own master. A strategy to conserve willpower that he used over and over with great success: precommitment. The essence of this strategy is to lock yourself into a virtuous path. You recognize that you’ll face terrible temptations to stray from the path, and that your willpower will weaken. So you make it impossible - or somehow unthinkably disgraceful or sinful - to leave the path. Precommitment is what Odysseus and his men used to get past the deadly songs of the Sirens. He had himself lashed to the mast with orders not to be untied no matter how much he pleaded to be freed to go to the Sirens. His men used a different form of precommitment by plugging their ears so they couldn’t hear the Sirens’ songs. They prevented themselves from being tempted at all, which is generally the safer of the two approaches. “Public Humiliation Diet” followed by a writer named Drew Magary. He vowed to weigh himself every day and promptly reveal the results on Twitter - which he did, and lost sixty pounds in five months. Software from Covenant Eyes that will track your Web browsing and then e-mail a list of the sites you visit to anyone you designate in advance - like, say, your boss or your spouse. People who draw up a contract without a financial penalty or a referee succeed only 35 percent of the time, whereas the ones with a penalty and a ref succeed nearly 80 percent of the time. What began as a precommitment turned into something permanent and more valuable: a habit. “The creation of order can only have been an antidote to the destructive capacities of nature all around him.” Stanley himself offered a similar explanation for his need to shave in the jungle: “I always presented as decent an appearance as possible, both for self-discipline and for self-respect.” Orderly habits like that can actually improve self-control in the long run by triggering automatic mental processes that don’t require much energy. Orderly Web sites, like the neat lab rooms, provided subtle cues guiding people unconsciously toward self-disciplined decisions and actions helping others. People with high self-control were distinguished by their behaviors that took place more or less automatically. Self-control turned out to be most effective when people used it to establish good habits and break bad ones. The best advice for young writers and aspiring professors is: Write every day. Use your self-control to form a daily habit, and you’ll produce more with less effort in the long run. A correct principle of self-control: Focus on lofty thoughts. “Why” questions push the mind up to higher levels of thinking and a focus on the future. “How” questions bring the mind down to low levels of thinking and a focus on the present. Have people move up or down from a given concept, like the word singer. To induce a high-level mind-set, people were asked, “A singer is an example of what?” To induce a low-level mind-set, they were asked, “What is an example of a singer?” Thus the answer pushed them to think either more globally or more specifically. These manipulations of mental state had no inherent relation to self-control. Yet self-control improved among people who were encouraged to think in high-level terms, and got worse among those who thought in low-level terms. Alcohol doesn’t increase your impulse to do stupid or destructive things; instead, it simply removes restraints. It lessens self-control in two ways: by lowering blood glucose and by reducing self-awareness. Religious people are less likely than others to develop unhealthy habits, like getting drunk, engaging in risky sex, taking illicit drugs, and smoking cigarettes. They’re more likely to wear seat belts, visit a dentist, and take vitamins. They have better social support, and their faith helps them cope psychologically with misfortunes. Environmentalism is especially strong in rich countries where traditional religion has waned. The devotion to God seems to give way to a reverence for nature’s beauty and transcendence. Environmentalists’ exhortations to reduce consumption and waste are teaching children some of the same self-control lessons offered in religious sermons and Victorian primers. Bright lines: These are clear, simple, unambiguous rules. You can’t help but notice when you cross a bright line. If you promise yourself to drink or smoke “moderately,” that’s not a bright line. It’s a fuzzy boundary with no obvious point at which you go from moderation to excess. In contrast, zero tolerance is a bright line: total abstinence with no exceptions anytime. Once you’re committed to following a bright-line rule, your present self can feel confident that your future self will observe it, too. Students with higher self-esteem did have higher grades. But which came first? Did students’ self-esteem lead to good grades, or did good grades lead to self-esteem? It turned out that grades in tenth grade predicted self-esteem in twelfth grade, but self-esteem in tenth grade failed to predict grades in twelfth grade. Thus, it seemed, the grades came first, and the self-esteem came afterward. Across the country, students’ self-esteem went up while their performance declined. They just felt better about doing worse. People with high self-esteem think they’re more popular, charming, and socially skilled than other people, but objective studies find no difference. Two clearly demonstrated benefits of high self-esteem, according to the review panel. First, it increases initiative, probably because it lends confidence. People with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs, to stand up for what they believe in, to approach others, to risk new undertakings. (This unfortunately includes being extra willing to do stupid or destructive things, even when everyone else advises against them.) Second, it feels good. High self-esteem seems to operate like a bank of positive emotions, which furnish a general sense of well-being and can be useful when you need an extra dose of confidence to cope with misfortune, ward off depression, or bounce back from failure. These benefits might be useful to people in some jobs, like sales, by enabling them to recover from frequent rejections, but this sort of persistence is a mixed blessing. It can also lead people to ignore sensible advice as they stubbornly keep wasting time and money on hopeless causes. Narcissists are legends in their own mind and addicted to their grandiose images. They have a deep craving to be admired by other people (but don’t feel a special need to be liked - it’s adulation they require). They expect to be treated as special beings and will turn nasty when criticized. They tend to make very good first impressions but don’t wear well. When the psychologist Delroy Paulhus asked people in groups to rate one another, the narcissists seemed to be everyone’s favorite person, but only during the first few meetings. After a few months, they usually slipped to the bottom of the rankings. God’s gift to the world can be hard to live with. When the going gets tough, people with high self-esteem often decide they shouldn’t bother. Cultural traditions in China and other Asian countries undoubtedly play an important role in instilling self-discipline, and those traditions in Asian-American homes have contributed to the children’s low levels of narcissism as well as their later successes. The Confucian concepts of chiao shun, which means “to train,” and guan, which means both “to govern” and “to love.” These parents might have seemed cold and rigid by American standards, but their children were flourishing both in and out of school. “As I watched American parents slathering praise on their kids for the lowest of tasks - drawing a squiggle or waving a stick - I came to see that Chinese parents have two things over their Western counterparts: (1) higher dreams for their children (2) higher regard for their children in the sense of knowing how much they can take.” That feeling of accomplishment. That’s where your self-esteem comes from, not from being told you’re the greatest. Forget about self-esteem. Work on self-control. By far the most important facet of punishment - and the most difficult one for parents - is consistency. Ideally, a parent should quickly discipline the child every single time he or she misbehaves, but in a restrained, even mild manner. A stern word or two is often enough as long as it’s done carefully and regularly. This approach can initially be more of a strain on the parents than on the child. They’re tempted to overlook or forgive some misdeed, if only because they’re tired or because it may spoil the pleasant time everyone else is having. You have to do what’s right for the child, and it really is all about being consistent. They have to grow up knowing what’s appropriate and inappropriate behavior. Nearly all experts agree that children need and want clear rules, and that being held accountable for obeying the rules is a vital feature of healthy development. But rules are helpful only if children know them and understand them, so the brighter the line, the better. Anything that forces children to exercise their self-control muscle can be helpful: taking music lessons, memorizing poems, saying prayers, minding their table manners, avoiding the use of profanity, writing thank-you notes. If you’re serious about controlling your weight, you need the discipline to follow these three rules: 1. Never go on a diet. 2. Never vow to give up chocolate or any other food. 3. Whether you’re judging yourself or judging others, never equate being overweight with having weak willpower. The first step in self-control is to establish realistic goals. The dieters reacted in the opposite pattern. The ones who had downed the giant milkshakes actually ate more cookies and crackers than the ones who’d had nothing to eat for hours. The researchers gave it a formal scientific term, counterregulatory eating, but in their lab and among colleagues it was known simply as the what-the-hell effect. Dieters have a fixed target in mind for their maximum daily calories, and when they exceed it for some unexpected reason, such as being given a pair of large milkshakes in an experiment, they regard their diet as blown for the day. That day is therefore mentally classified as a failure, regardless of what else happens. Virtue cannot resume until tomorrow. So they think, What the hell, I might as well enjoy myself today - and the resulting binge often puts on far more weight than the original lapse. Dieters don’t even seem to be aware of how much damage these binges do. As long as the diet wasn’t busted for the day, the dieters tracked what they were eating. But once they broke the diet and succumbed to the what-the-hell effect, they stopped counting and became even less aware than nondieters of what they were eating. Their obesity made them likely to go on diets, and their diets caused them to rely on external instead of internal cues. Dieters learn to eat according to a plan, not to their inner feelings and cravings. You mainly try to tune out the start-eating signal, but the start and stop signals are intertwined, so you typically lose touch with the stop-eating signal, too, They have only the one bright line, and once they have passed it, there are no more limits. Non-dieters could sit next to an array of snacks - Doritos, Skittles, M&M’s, salted peanuts - without using up willpower. The dieters can resist for a while, but each act of resistance further lowers their willpower. Then, as they’re weakening, they face yet another of the peculiarly maddening challenges of controlling eating. To continue resisting temptation, they need to replenish the willpower they’ve lost. But to resupply that energy, they need to give the body glucose. They’re trapped in a nutritional catch-22: 1. In order not to eat, a dieter needs willpower. 2. In order to have willpower, a dieter needs to eat. Faced with this dilemma of whether to eat or not, a dieter might try telling herself that the best option is to slightly relax the diet. She might reason that it’s best to consume a little food and try to salve her conscience: Look, I had to break the diet in order to save it. But once she strays from the diet, we know what she’s liable to tell herself: What the hell. And then: Let the binge begin. Brush your teeth early in the evening. Make highly specific plans for automatic behavior in certain situations. If x happens, I will do y. The more you use this technique to transfer the control of your behavior to automatic processes, the less effort you will expend. People who weighed themselves every day were much more successful at keeping their weight from creeping back up. The more carefully and frequently you monitor yourself, the better you’ll control yourself. Those who kept a food diary lost twice as much weight as those who used other techniques. Telling yourself I can have this later operates in the mind a bit like having it now. It satisfies the craving. It’s less stressful on the mind to say Later rather than Never. You could sum up a large new body of research literature with a simple rule: The best way to reduce stress in your life is to stop screwing up. That means setting up your life so that you have a realistic chance to succeed. Successful people don’t use their willpower as a last-ditch defense to stop themselves from disaster. These people have less need to use willpower because they’re beset by fewer temptations and inner conflicts. They’re better at arranging their lives so that they avoid problem situations. When procrastinators are feeling anxious about a difficult job, or just bored by a mundane chore, they give in to the urge to improve their mood by doing something else. They go for the immediate reward, playing a video game instead of cleaning the kitchen or writing a term paper, and they try to ignore the long-term consequences. What matters is the exertion, not the outcome. If you struggle with temptation and then give in, you’re still depleted because you struggled. Giving in does not replenish the willpower you have already expended. Have an idea of what you want to accomplish in a month and how to get there. Leave some flexibility and anticipate setbacks. When you check your progress at month’s end. Set their top goals for the week. “You can’t have more than three goals. You can’t go off working on other goals until you’ve done the top three.” A way to boost your willpower is to expend a little of it on neatness. People exert less self-control after seeing a messy desk than after seeing a clean desk. Dorothy Parker gave her editor at The New Yorker the all-time best excuse for an overdue piece: “Somebody was using the pencil.” Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn’t the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment. Benchley explained how he could summon the discipline to read a scientific article about tropical fish, build a bookshelf, arrange books on said shelf, and write an answer to a friend’s letter that had been sitting in a pile on his desk for twenty years. All he had to do was draw up a to-do list for the week and put these tasks below his top priority - his job of writing an article. A professional writer needed to set aside at least four hours a day for his job: “He doesn’t have to write, and if he doesn’t feel like it, he shouldn’t try. He can look out of the window or stand on his head or writhe on the floor, but he is not to do any other positive thing, not read, write letters, glance at magazines, or write checks.” This Nothing Alternative is a marvelously simple tool against procrastination Two very simple rules, a. you don’t have to write. b. you can’t do anything else. The rest comes of itself. That’s the seeming effortlessness that comes from playing offense. Setting aside time to do one and only one thing. Resolve to start your day with ninety minutes devoted to your most important goal, with no interruptions. Precommitment is the ultimate offensive weapon. One of the most common reasons for the self-control problem is overconfidence in willpower. Benefit just by noting the word count at the beginning and end of the day: Games: Even when players lose battles or make mistakes or die, they remain motivated because of the emphasis on rewards rather than punishment. Instead of feeling as if they’ve failed, the players think that they just haven’t succeeded yet. When societies modernize, the newly affluent people at first tend to gorge themselves on previously forbidden (or unaffordable) fruit, but eventually they look for a more satisfying way to live. We assume we’ll magically have more free time in the future than we do today. So we say yes to a work commitment three months from now that we’d never accept if it were next week - and then discover too late that we still don’t have any time for it. Inner discipline still leads to outer kindness.","You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Two traits that consistently predict “positive outcomes” in life: intelligence and self-control. Most major problems, personal and social, center on failure of self-control. When people were asked about their failings, a lack of self-control was at the top of the list. So let's talk about self-control...."
Power of Full Engagement,Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz,126692845,8,"Every one of our thoughts, emotions and behaviors has an energy consequence. Performance, health and happiness are grounded in the skillful management of energy. To be fully engaged, we must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused and spiritually aligned. Immerse yourself in the mission you are on. Eager to get to work in the morning, equally happy to return home in the evening - and capable of setting clear boundaries between the two. Professional athletes typically spend about 90 percent of their time training, in order to be able to perform 10 percent of the time. Their entire lives are designed around expanding, sustaining and renewing the energy they need to compete for short, focused periods of time. At a practical level, they build very precise routines for managing energy in all spheres of their lives - eating and sleeping; working out and resting; summoning the appropriate emotions; mentally preparing and staying focused; and connecting regularly to the mission they have set for themselves. The primary markers of physical capacity are strength, endurance, flexibility and resilience. These are precisely the same markers of capacity emotionally, mentally and spiritually. Stretching increases flexibility. Emotional flexibility reflects the capacity to move freely and appropriately along a wide spectrum of emotions rather than responding rigidly or defensively. Emotional resilience is the ability to bounce back from experiences of disappointment, frustration and even loss. Mental endurance is a measure of the ability to sustain focus and concentration over time. Mental flexibility is marked by the capacity to move between the rational and the intuitive and to embrace multiple points of view. Spiritual strength is reflected in the commitment to one’s deepest values, regardless of circumstance and even when adhering to them involves personal sacrifice. Spiritual flexibility reflects the tolerance for values and beliefs that are different than one’s own, so long as those values and beliefs don’t bring harm to others. We, too, must learn to live our own lives as a series of sprints - fully engaging for periods of time, and then fully disengaging and seeking renewal before jumping back into the fray To build capacity, we must push beyond our normal limits, training in the same systematic way that elite athletes do. Building “muscles” in every dimension of our lives - from empathy and patience to focus and creativity to integrity and commitment. We grow at all levels by expending energy beyond our ordinary limits and then recovering. Expose a muscle to ordinary demand and it won’t grow. With age it will actually lose strength. The limiting factor in building any “muscle” is that many of us back off at the slightest hint of discomfort. To meet increased demand in our lives, we must learn to systematically build and strengthen muscles wherever our capacity is insufficient. Any form of stress that prompts discomfort has the potential to expand our capacity - physically, mentally, emotionally or spiritually - so long as it is followed by adequate recovery. Will and discipline require pushing yourself to a particular behavior. A ritual PULLS at you. The power of rituals is that they insure that we use as little conscious energy as possible. Imagine that every time you failed to focus your attention fully on the task at hand, you put someone’s life at risk. Very quickly, you would become less negative, reckless and sloppy in the way you manage your energy. We hold ourselves accountable for the ways that we manage our time, and for that matter our money. We must learn to hold ourselves at least equally accountable for how we manage our energy. Creating positive rituals is the most powerful means we have found to effectively manage energy in the service of full engagement. “How should I spend my energy in a way that is consistent with my deepest values?” It is impossible to chart a course of change until you are able to look honestly at who you are today. Face the Truth. Denying to ourselves that the choices we are making are having a consequential impact on the quantity, quality, force and focus of our energy. Go to PowerofFullEngagement.com website and take a brief version of our Full Engagement Inventory. Some of our existing habits help us get through the day, but take a long-term toll on our performance, health and happiness. Examples include relying on junk food for bursts of energy. Building rituals requires defining very precise behaviors and performing them at very specific times - motivated by deeply held values. Great leaders are stewards of organizational energy. They begin by effectively managing their own energy. As leaders, they must mobilize, focus, invest, channel, renew and expand the energy of others. The powerful source of energy that can be derived from connecting to a clear sense of purpose. Unmoored from deeply held values, he didn’t have much motivation to take better care of himself physically, or to control his impatience, or even to prioritize his time and focus his attention. An imbalance between the expenditure and the recovery of energy: they were either overtraining or undertraining. Both overtraining and undertraining have performance consequences that include persistent injuries and sickness, anxiety, negativity and anger, difficulty concentrating, and loss of passion. When we expend energy, we draw down our reservoir. When we recover energy, we fill it back up. Too much energy expenditure without sufficient recovery eventually leads to burnout and breakdown. (Overuse it and lose it.) Too much recovery without sufficient stress leads to atrophy and weakness. (Use it or lose it.) The benefits of a sustained fitness program decrease significantly after just one week of inactivity - and disappear altogether in as few as four weeks. Emotional depth and resilience depend on active engagement with others and with our own feelings. Mental acuity diminishes in the absence of ongoing intellectual challenge. Spiritual energy capacity depends on regularly revisiting our deepest values and holding ourselves accountable in our behavior. We assume that we can spend energy indefinitely in some dimensions - often the mental and emotional - and that we can perform effectively without investing much energy at all in others - most commonly the physical and the spiritual. In the sixteen to twenty seconds between points in a match, the heart rates of top competitors dropped as much as twenty beats per minute. By building highly efficient and focused recovery routines, these players had found a way to derive extraordinary energy renewal in a very short period of time. Many of us treat life as a marathon that doesn’t end until it finally ends for good. We must learn to establish stopping points in our days, inviolable times when we step off the track, cease processing information and shift our attention from achievement to restoration. To build capacity, we must systematically expose ourselves to more stress - followed by adequate recovery. We grow at all levels by expending energy beyond our normal limits, and then recovering. The catch is that we instinctively resist pushing beyond our current comfort zones. The best moments in our lives usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. The deepest satisfaction comes from our willingness to expose ourselves to new challenges and engage in novel experiences. The willingness to challenge our comfort zones depends partly on our degree of underlying security. To whatever degree we are consumed by anxious concerns, we are less willing to expose ourselves to any discomfort. Gradual and incremental exposure to increasing doses of stress. The size of our energy reservoir depends on the patterns of our breathing, the foods that we eat and when we eat them, the quantity and quality of our sleep, the degree to which we get intermittent recovery during the day, and the level of our fitness. Breathing in to a count of three and out to a count of six, lowers arousal and quiets not just the body but also the mind and the emotions. Even if you don’t feel consciously hungry, eating breakfast is critically important. It not only increases blood glucose levels, but also jump-starts metabolism. The frequency with which we eat also influences our capacity to stay fully engaged and to sustain high performance. Eating five to six low calorie, highly nutritious “meals” a day insures a steady resupply of energy. Even the most energy rich foods won’t fuel high performance for the four to eight hours that many of us frequently permit to pass between meals. Snacks between meals should typically be between 100 and 150 calories and once again should focus on low-glycemic foods such as nuts and sunflower seeds, fruits. The shifts of energy that we experience are tied to the ultradian rhythms that regulate physiological markers of alertness at 90-to 120-minute intervals. It took him four weeks to lock in these new rituals so that they began to exert a noticeable pull on him. Recommended exercise protocol is twenty to thirty minutes of continuous exercise, three to five days a week, at 60 to 85 percent of maximum heart rate. Sprinting, walking up stairs and down, bicycling and even weight lifting, so long as the effect is to rhythmically raise and lower heart rate. Stress inoculation occurs only when the stress intensity is at the optimal level - high enough to activate a person’s psychological and biological systems, but low enough so as not to overwhelm them. If the stress level is not high enough, inoculation will not occur; if the stress level is too high, stress sensitization will occur, and the individual will probably perform less effectively when he is stressed again. In short, minimizing or avoiding stress is just as destructive to capacity as excessive stress without recovery. Researchers looked at the effects of bed rest on some 16,000 patients with fifteen different medical problems. It turned out that patients got no significant beneficial effect from prolonged bed rest, regardless of their medical condition. To the contrary, bed rest tended to delay recovery and in some cases cause further damage to the patient. These conclusions even applied to conditions for which bed rest has long been recommended, including low back pain, recovery after a heart attack. He had never stuck with an exercise program long enough to derive any benefits. Committed to an exercise program for sixty days - the outer limit of what it typically takes to put a new ritual into place. The key to any new fitness regimen is to start slowly and build incrementally. Heart-rate monitor. Target heart rate. he could reach that rate simply by walking fast. He maintained it for sixty seconds and then slowed down until his heart rate dropped to 90. Repeated the same up-and-down sequence for the next twenty minutes. Rather than pushing himself continuously for twenty or twenty-five minutes, he was teaching his body both to tolerate stress and to recover efficiently. Emotional intelligence is simply the capacity to manage emotions skillfully in the service of high positive energy and full engagement. In practical terms, the key “muscles” or competencies that fuel positive emotion are self-confidence, self-control (self-regulation), social skills (interpersonal effectiveness) and empathy. Smaller, supportive “muscles” include patience, openness, trust and enjoyment. When our emotional muscles are weak or insufficient to meet demand - if we have a lack of confidence or too little patience, for example - we must systematically build capacity by devising rituals to push past our current capacity and then recover. Epidemiologist David Snowdon, study of 678 aging nuns who had been required to write a personal essay when they came into the order in their early twenties. Those nuns whose writing expressed a preponderance of positive emotions (happiness, love, hope, gratitude and contentment) tended to live longer and more productive lives. Nuns with the highest number of positive-emotion sentences had half the risk of death at any age as those with the lowest number of such sentences. Undertake activities simply because they are enjoyable and emotionally nourishing. Keeping this physical routine helped anchor him to a sense of normalcy and provided a source of emotional recovery each day. Talking freely with her new friends. She became as invested in their lives as they did in hers. True empathy requires letting go of our own agendas, at least temporarily. All virtues are entailed. Honesty without compassion, for example, becomes cruelty. To perform at our best we must be able to sustain concentration, and to move flexibly between broad and narrow, as well as internal and external focus. The key supportive muscles that fuel optimal mental energy include mental preparation, visualization, positive self-talk, effective time management, and creativity. Agents who scored in the top 10 percent for optimism sold 88 percent more than those ranked in the most pessimistic 10 percent. Da Vinci wrote, “It is a very good plan every now and then to go away and have a little relaxation…. When you come back to the work your judgment will be surer, since to remain constantly at work will cause you to lose the power of judgment.” Sequential steps of the creative process. Five stages are now widely recognized: first insight, saturation, incubation, illumination and verification. The highest form of creativity depends on a rhythmic movement between engagement and disengagement, thinking and letting go, activity and rest. Exposing one’s self to short-term stress, for example, can stimulate a burst of adrenaline that actually improves memory. A Japanese neuroscientist put a group of young people on a jogging program of thirty minutes, two to three times a week. When he tested them at the end of twelve weeks on a series of memory skills, their scores significantly increased, and so did the speed with which they completed the tests. Of equal note, their gains disappeared almost immediately when they stopped jogging. The key muscle that fuels spiritual energy is character - the courage and conviction to live by our values, even when doing so requires personal sacrifice and hardship. Supportive spiritual muscles include passion, commitment, integrity and honesty. Spiritual energy is sustained by balancing a commitment to others with adequate self-care. The disconnection from a compelling sense of purpose had robbed him of passion and of any clear sense of direction. Expanding spiritual capacity requires subordinating our own needs to something beyond our self-interest. Because we often perceive our own needs as urgent, shifting attention away from them can prompt very primitive survival fears. If I truly focus my attention on others, we worry, who is going to look out for me? It is a mark of courage to set aside self-interest in order to be of service to others or to a cause. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state, but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal. ""We are much better than we know. We have unrealized capacities that sometimes only emerge in crisis. So if there is a purpose to the suffering that is cancer, I think it must be this: it’s meant to improve us."" - Lance Armstrong We become fully engaged only when we feel that what we are doing really matters. Purpose creates a destination. Look at someone that you deeply respect. Describe three qualities in this person that you most admire. Create a vision for how we intend to invest our energy. To provide inspiration it needs to be lofty, ambitious and even a bit overreaching. It needs to be realistic, specific and personal. “Every form of addiction is bad,” wrote Carl Jung, “no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol or morphine or idealism.” We deceive ourselves in order to protect our self-esteem - our image of who we are or wish to be. Intellectualizing is a means of acknowledging a truth cognitively without experiencing its impact emotionally. But why were the most successful leaders also so consistently self-effacing, modest and eager to share credit? In part, it was that their humility gave others room to flourish. The success of any large venture depends on giving people a sense of ownership and a feeling of being valued and valuable. Genuine humility also meant that these leaders were open to opinions contrary to their own and to the possibility that their views weren’t always necessarily right. They were confident enough to be wrong without feeling diminished. “Ask someone to give a description of the personality type which he finds most despicable, most unbearable and hateful, and most impossible to get along with,” writes Edward Whitmont, “and he will produce a description of his own repressed characteristics….These very qualities are so unacceptable to him precisely because they represent his own repressed side; only that which we cannot accept within ourselves do we find impossible to live with in others.” Like all of our “muscles,” self-awareness withers from disuse and deepens when we push past our resistance to see more of the truth. We fall asleep to aspects of ourselves each and every day. Much as we must keep returning to the gym and pushing weight against resistance in order to sustain or increase our physical strength, so we must persistently shed light on those aspects of ourselves that we prefer not to see in order to build our mental, emotional and spiritual capacity. When it comes to absorbing the truth, too big a dose can be overwhelming, and even self-defeating. Some truths are too unbearable to be absorbed all at once. Ivan Lendl was far from the most physically gifted tennis player of his era, but for five years he was the number-one-ranked player in the world. His edge was in the routines that he built. He followed similar routines in every dimension of his life. He developed a rigorous fitness regimen off the court, which included sprints, middle-distance runs, long bicycle rides and strength training. He did regular ballet bar exercises to increase his balance and grace. He adhered to a low-fat, high complex-carbohydrate diet and ate at very specific times. Lendl also practiced a series of daily mental-focus exercises to improve his concentration - and regularly introduced new ones to assure that they remained challenging. At tournaments, he gave clear instructions to friends and family not to burden him with issues that might distract him from his mission. Whatever he did, he was either fully engaged or strategically disengaged. He even meticulously scheduled his time for relaxation and recovery, which included recreational golf, daily afternoon naps and regularly scheduled massages. On the court, during matches, he relied on another set of rituals to keep himself centered and focused, including visualizing entire points before playing them and following the same multiple-step ritual each time he stepped up to the line to serve. It is perfectly logical to assume that Lendl excelled in part because he had extraordinary will and discipline. That probably isn’t so. A growing body of research suggests that as little as 5 percent of our behaviors are consciously self-directed. We are creatures of habit and as much as 95 percent of what we do occurs automatically or in reaction to a demand or an anxiety. What Lendl understood brilliantly and instinctively was the power of positive rituals - precise, consciously acquired behaviors that become automatic in our lives, fueled by a deep sense of purpose. Positive energy rituals are powerful on three levels. They help us to insure that we effectively manage energy in the service of whatever mission we are on. They reduce the need to rely on our limited conscious will and discipline to take action. Finally, rituals are a powerful means by which to translate our values and priorities into action - to embody what matters most to us in our everyday behaviors. Rituals serve as anchors, insuring that even in the most difficult circumstances we will continue to use our energy in service of the values that we hold most dear. Every time we participate in a ritual, we are expressing our beliefs, either verbally or more implicitly. The sustaining power of rituals comes from the fact that they conserve energy. “We should not cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing,” Civilization advances by extending the number of operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Discipline, which imply PUSHING ourselves to action, a well-defined ritual PULLS us. We feel somehow worse if we don’t do it. It is possible to strategically build the muscle of self-control. The same training regimen applies. Exercise self-control or empathy or patience past normal limits, and then allow time for rest and these muscles become progressively stronger. Shift from the mentality of a marathoner to that of a sprinter. Because Peter told us that he felt freshest early in the morning, we had him begin his workdays at 6:30 A.M. and write for ninety minutes before he did anything else. At 8:00 A.M., Peter stopped to have breakfast with his wife Peter returned to work at 8:30 A.M. and wrote without interruption until 10:00. At that point, he took a twenty-minute recovery break - ten minutes of training with light weights followed by ten minutes of meditation. He also ate a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts before heading back to his desk. Peter’s third writing session went from 10:30 until 12:00 NOON, at which point he went jogging and then ate lunch. During those 41/2 hours of focused morning work, Peter was able to write nearly twice as much as had sitting at his desk for up to ten hours a day in previous years. If our rituals become too rigid, unvarying and linear, the eventual consequence is boredom, disengagement and even diminished passion and productivity. Hold fast to our rituals when the pressures in our lives threaten to throw us off track, and to periodically revisit and change them so that they remain fresh. There are several key elements in building effective energy-management rituals but none so important as specificity of timing and the precision of behavior during the thirty-to sixty-day acquisition period. Specificity of timing and precision of behavior dramatically increase the likelihood of success. By determining when, where and how a behavior will occur, we no longer have to think much about getting it done. The less thinking people have to do under adverse circumstances, the better. Build rituals in increments - focusing on one significant change at a time, and setting reachable goals at each step of the process. Create a daily accountability log. This exercise can be as simple as a yes or no check on a sheet kept by the side of your bed.","The authors worked with the best athletes and executives for years, and found that the best ones knew how to push themselves, then recuperate, push, recuperate. Take this same approach to your emotional, mental, physical, and even spiritual life, and it's a powerful metaphor. Think of sprints, not marathons. Be fully in whatever you're in, then give time to recuperate. But push further each time, past your comfort zone, like a good exercise plan."
Moonwalking with Einstein,Joshua Foer,159420229X,8,"## CHARACTER BUILDING Memory training was considered a form of character building, a way of developing the cardinal virtue of prudence and ethics. Only through memorizing could ideas truly be incorporated into one’s psyche and their values absorbed. Memorization techniques existed to etch foundational texts and ideas into the brain. A strong memory was seen as the greatest virtue since it represented the internalization of a universe of external knowledge. Memory training is a form of mental workout. Over time, like any form of exercise, it’ll make the brain fitter, quicker, and more nimble. Roman orators argued that the art of memory - the proper retention and ordering of knowledge - was a vital instrument for the invention of new ideas. A trained memory wasn’t just about gaining easy access to information; it was about strengthening one’s personal ethics and becoming a more complete person. A trained memory was the key to cultivating “judgment, citizenship, and piety.” Schools go about teaching all wrong. They pour vast amounts of information into students’ heads, but don’t teach them how to retain it. What one memorized helped shape one’s character. Where could one look for guidance about how to act, if not the depths of memory? The ancient and medieval way of reading was totally different from how we read today. One didn’t just memorize texts; one ruminated on them - chewed them up and regurgitated them like cud - and in the process, became intimate with them in a way that made them one’s own. Who are you going to be more impressed by, the person who has a litany of his own opinions, or the historian who can draw on the great thinkers who came before him? The people whose intellects I most admire always seem to have a fitting anecdote or germane fact at the ready. They’re able to reach out across the breadth of their learning and pluck from distant patches. ## ATTENTION What I had really trained my brain to do, as much as to memorize, was to be more mindful, and to pay attention to the world around me. Remembering can only happen if you decide to take notice. When we forget the name of a new acquaintance, it’s because we’re too busy thinking about what we’re going to say next, instead of paying attention. Part of the reason techniques like visual imagery and the memory palace work so well is that they enforce a degree of attention and mindfulness that is normally lacking. You can’t create an image of a word, a number, or a person’s name without dwelling on it. And you can’t dwell on something without making it more memorable. From the vast amounts of data pouring in through the senses, our brains must quickly sift out which information is likely to have some bearing on the future, attend to that, and ignore the noise. ## EXPERTISE On every single test of general cognitive ability, the mental athletes’ scores came back well within the normal range. The memory champs weren’t smarter, and they didn’t have special brains. When the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation. Experts see the world differently. They notice things that nonexperts don’t see. They home in on the information that matters most, and have an almost automatic sense of what to do with it. And most important, experts process the enormous amounts of information flowing through their senses in more sophisticated ways. If every sensation or thought was immediately filed away in the enormous database that is our long-term memory, we’d be drowning in irrelevant information. Most of the things that pass through our brain don’t need to be remembered any longer than the moment or two we spend perceiving them. Like a computer, our ability to operate in the world, is limited by the amount of information we can juggle at one time. Unless we repeat things over and over, they tend to slip from our grasp. Repeating them over and over again to themselves in the “phonological loop,” which is just a fancy name for the little voice that we can hear inside our head when we talk to ourselves. The phonological loop acts as an echo, producing a short-term memory buffer that can store sounds for just a couple seconds. Chunking is a way to decrease the number of items you have to remember by increasing the size of each item. What we already know determines what we’re able to learn. Chunking takes seemingly meaningless information and reinterprets it in light of information that is already stored away somewhere in our long-term memory. All experts use their memories to see the world differently. Over many years, they build up a bank of experience that shapes how they perceive new information. Chess experts tended to see the right moves almost right away. It was as if the chess experts weren’t thinking so much as reacting. They talked about configurations of pieces like “pawn structures” and immediately noticed things that were out of sorts, like exposed rooks. They weren’t seeing the board as thirty-two pieces. They were seeing it as chunks of pieces, and systems of tension. A telling fact about memory, and about expertise in general: We don’t remember isolated facts; we remember things in context. Contrary to all the old wisdom that chess is an intellectual activity based on analysis, many of the chess master’s important decisions about which moves to make happen in the immediate act of perceiving the board. Higher-rated chess players are recalling information from long-term memory. Lower-ranked players are encoding new information. The experts are interpreting the present board in term of their massive knowledge of past ones. The lower-ranked players are seeing the board as something new. What we call expertise is really just “vast amounts of knowledge, pattern-based retrieval, and planning mechanisms acquired over many years of experience in the associated domain.” In other words, a great memory isn’t just a by-product of expertise; it is the essence of expertise. ## OK PLATEAU / DELIBERATE PRACTICE Many people sit behind a keyboard for at least several hours a day in essence practicing their typing. Why don’t they just keep getting better and better? Three stages that anyone goes through when acquiring a new skill. 1. “cognitive stage” you’re intellectualizing the task and discovering new strategies to accomplish it more proficiently. 2. “associative stage,” you’re concentrating less, making fewer major errors, and generally becoming more efficient. 3. “autonomous stage,” when you figure that you’ve gotten as good as you need to get at the task and you’re basically running on autopilot. During that autonomous stage, you lose conscious control over what you’re doing. Most of the time that’s a good thing. Your mind has one less thing to worry about. Call it the “OK plateau,” the point at which you decide you’re OK with how good you are at something, turn on autopilot, and stop improving. What separates experts from the rest of us is that they tend to engage in a very directed, highly focused routine, which Ericsson has labeled “deliberate practice.” Consciously keeping out of the autonomous stage while they practice by doing three things: focusing on their technique, staying goal-oriented, and getting constant and immediate feedback on their performance. In other words, they force themselves to stay in the “cognitive phase.” Unless he’s consciously challenging himself and monitoring his performance - reviewing, responding, rethinking, rejiggering - it’s never going to make him appreciably better. Regular practice simply isn’t enough. To improve, we must watch ourselves fail, and learn from our mistakes. The best way to get out of the autonomous stage and off the OK plateau is to actually practice failing. One way to do that is to put yourself in the mind of someone far more competent at the task you’re trying to master, and try to figure out how that person works through problems. The single best predictor of an individual’s chess skill is not the amount of chess he’s played against opponents, but rather the amount of time he’s spent sitting alone working through old games. Force yourself to type faster than feels comfortable, and to allow yourself to make mistakes. Typists were repeatedly flashed words 10 to 15 percent faster than their fingers were able to translate them onto the keyboard. At first they weren’t able to keep up, but over a period of days they figured out the obstacles that were slowing them down, and overcame them, and then continued to type at the faster speed. Ericsson suggested I try the same thing with cards. He told me to find a metronome and to try to memorize a card every time it clicked. Once I figured out my limits, he instructed me to set the metronome 10 to 20 percent faster than that and keep trying at the quicker pace until I stopped making mistakes. Whenever I came across a card that was particularly troublesome, I was supposed to make a note of it, and see if I could figure out why it was giving me problems. It worked, and within a couple days I was off the OK plateau and my card times began falling again at a steady clip. If they’re not practicing deliberately, even experts can see their skills backslide. My practice would have to be focused and deliberate. That meant I needed to collect data and analyze it for feedback. And that meant this whole operation was about to get ratcheted up. Practice makes perfect. But only if it’s the right kind of concentrated, self-conscious, deliberate practice. I’d learned firsthand that with focus, motivation, and, above all, time, the mind can be trained to do extraordinary things. ## CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION Learning, memory, and creativity are the same fundamental process directed with a different focus. The art and science of memory is about developing the capacity to quickly create images that link disparate ideas. Creativity is the ability to form similar connections between disparate images and to create something new and hurl it into the future so it becomes a poem, or a building, or a dance, or a novel. Creativity is, in a sense, future memory. If the essence of creativity is linking disparate facts and ideas, then the more facility you have making associations, and the more facts and ideas you have at your disposal, the better you’ll be at coming up with new ideas. Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, was the mother of the Muses. Latin root inventio is the basis of two words in our modern English vocabulary: inventory and invention. In order to invent, one first needed a proper inventory, a bank of existing ideas to draw on. Not just an inventory, but an indexed inventory. One needed a way of finding just the right piece of information at just the right moment. This is what the art of memory was ultimately most useful for. It was not merely a tool for recording but also a tool of invention and composition. When information goes “in one ear and out the other,” it’s often because it doesn’t have anything to stick to. The people whose intellects I most admire always seem to have a fitting anecdote or germane fact at the ready. They’re able to reach out across the breadth of their learning and pluck from distant patches. People who have more associations to hang their memories on are more likely to remember new things, which in turn means they will know more, and be able to learn more. The more we remember, the better we are at processing the world. ## LANDMARKS AND NOVELTY IN LIFE The idea is to avoid that feeling you have when you get to the end of the year and feel like, where the hell did that go? How to do it? By remembering more. By providing life with more chronological landmarks. By making yourself more aware of time’s passage. The more we pack our lives with memories, the slower time seems to fly. Monotony collapses time; novelty unfolds it. You can exercise daily and eat healthily and live a long life, while experiencing a short one. If you spend your life sitting in a cubicle and passing papers, one day is bound to blend unmemorably into the next - and disappear. That’s why it’s important to change routines regularly, and take vacations to exotic locales, and have as many new experiences as possible that can serve to anchor our memories. Creating new memories stretches out psychological time, and lengthens our perception of our lives. In youth we may have an absolutely new experience, subjective or objective, every hour of the day. Life seems to speed up as we get older because life gets less memorable. Of all the things one could be obsessive about collecting, memories of one’s own life don’t seem like the most unreasonable. There’s something even strangely rational about it. Socrates thought the unexamined life was not worth living. How much more so the unremembered life? The elaborate system of externalized memory we’ve created is a way of fending off mortality. Siffre spent two months living in total isolation in a subterranean cave, without access to clock, calendar, or sun. Sleeping and eating only when his body told him to, he sought to discover how the natural rhythms of human life would be affected by living “beyond time.” Very quickly Siffre’s memory deteriorated. In the dreary darkness, his days melded into one another and became one continuous, indistinguishable blob. Since there was nobody to talk to, and not much to do, there was nothing novel to impress itself upon his memory. There were no chronological landmarks by which he could measure the passage of time. At some point he stopped being able to remember what happened even the day before. ## PERMANENCE Each time we think about a memory, we integrate it more deeply into our web of other memories, and therefore make it more stable and less likely to be dislodged. Older memories are often remembered as if captured by a third person holding a camera, whereas more recent events tend to be remembered in the first person, as if through one’s own eyes. It’s as if things that happened to us become simply things that happened. Or as if, over time, the brain naturally turns episodes into facts. Over time, as they are revisited and reinforced, memories are consolidated in a way that makes them impervious to erasure. The vast majority of us don’t trust our memories. We find shortcuts to avoid relying on them. We complain about them endlessly, and see even their smallest lapses as evidence that they’re starting to fail us entirely. If something is going to be made memorable, it has to be dwelled upon, repeated. ## ASSOCIATIONS The nonlinear associative nature of our brains makes it impossible for us to consciously search our memories in an orderly way. A memory only pops directly into consciousness if it is cued by some other thought or perception. Take the kinds of memories our brains aren’t good at holding on to and transform them into the kinds of memories our brains were built for. Change whatever boring thing is being inputted into your memory into something that is so colorful, so exciting, and so different from anything you’ve seen before that you can’t possibly forget it. It’s very important to try to remember this image multisensorily. The more associative hooks a new piece of information has, the more securely it gets embedded into the network of things you already know, and the more likely it is to remain in memory. It’s important that you deeply process that image, so you give it as much attention as possible. Things that grab our attention are more memorable, and attention is not something you can simply will. It has to be pulled in by the details. By laying down elaborate, engaging, vivid images in your mind, it more or less guarantees that your brain is going to end up storing a robust, dependable memory. Exaggerate its proportions. The funnier, lewder, and more bizarre, the better. When we see in everyday life things that are petty, ordinary, and banal, we generally fail to remember them, because the mind is not being stirred by anything novel or marvelous. But if we see or hear something exceptionally base, dishonorable, extraordinary, great, unbelievable, or laughable, that we are likely to remember for a long time. Create these sorts of lavish images on the fly, to paint in the mind a scene so unlike any that has been seen before that it cannot be forgotten. And to do it quickly. Particularly interesting, and therefore memorable: jokes and sex. Animate images tend to be more memorable than inanimate images. Disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud or smeared with red paint. He has created his own dictionary of images for each of the two hundred most common words that can’t easily be visualized. “And” is a circle (“and” rhymes with rund, which means round in German). “The” is someone walking on his knees (die, a German word for “the,” rhymes with Knie, the German word for “knee”). When the poem reaches a period, he hammers a nail into that locus. What do you do with words like “ephemeral” or “self” that are impossible to see? Gunther’s method of creating an image for the un-imageable is a very old one: to visualize a similarly sounding, or punning, word in its place. This process of transforming words into images involves a kind of remembering by forgetting: In order to memorize a word by its sound, its meaning has to be completely dismissed. Many actors will tell you that they break their lines into units they call “beats,” each of which involves some specific intention or goal on the character’s part, which they train themselves to empathize with. Giving a line more associational hooks to hang on by embedding it in a context of both emotional and physical cues. The art of memory is learning how little of an image you need to see to make it memorable. Savor the images, and really enjoy them. So long as you’re surprising yourself with their lively goodness, ## MEMORY PALACE Convert something unmemorable into a series of engrossing visual images and mentally arrange them within an imagined space, and suddenly those forgettable items become unforgettable. Create a space in the mind’s eye, a place that you know well and can easily visualize, and then populate that imagined place with images representing whatever you want to remember. He used his own body parts as loci to help him memorize the entire 56,000-word, 1,774-page Oxford Chinese-English dictionary. Humans are very, very good at learning spaces. Walking around: Without really noticing it, you’d remember the whereabouts of hundreds of objects and all sorts of dimensions that you wouldn’t even notice yourself noticing. If you actually add up all that information, it’s like the equivalent of a short novel. But we don’t ever register that as being a memory achievement. Humans just gobble up spatial information. The principle of the memory palace is to use one’s exquisite spatial memory to structure and store information whose order comes less naturally. The crucial thing was to choose a memory palace with which I was intimately familiar. I first needed a stockpile of memory palaces at my disposal. I went for walks around the neighborhood. I visited friends’ houses, the local playground. Know these buildings so thoroughly - have such a rich and textured set of associations with every corner of every room - that when it comes time to learn some new body of information, you can speed through your palaces, scattering images as quickly as you can sketch them in your imagination. The better I knew the buildings, and the more each felt like home, the stickier my images would be, and the easier it would be to reconstruct them later. I’d need about a dozen memory palaces just to begin my training. He has several hundred, a metropolis of mental storehouses. (The phrase “in the first place” is a vestige from the art of memory.) ## ORAL TRADITIONS The brain best remembers things that are repeated, rhythmic, rhyming, structured, and above all easily visualized. If you can turn a set of words into a jingle, they can become exceedingly difficult to knock out of your head. The reason we teach kids the alphabet in a song and not as twenty-six individual letters. Song is the ultimate structuring device for language. The variability that is built into the poetry of oral traditions allows the bard to adapt the material to the audience, but it also allows more memorable versions of the poem to arise. Folklorists have compared oral poems to pebbles worn down by the water. They’re made smooth over many retellings as the harder-to-remember pieces get chipped away, or made easier to retain and repeat. Irrelevant digressions are forgotten. Long or rare words are avoided. The original oral performance with its poetry was stripped of functional purpose and relegated to the secondary role of entertainment, one which it always had but which now became its sole purpose. No longer burdened by the requirements of oral transmission, poetry was free to become art. We don’t speak with spaces. Where one word ends and another begins is a relatively arbitrary linguistic convention. If you look at a sonographic chart visualizing the sound waves of someone speaking English, it’s practically impossible to tell where the spaces are, which is one of the reasons why it’s proven so difficult to train computers to recognize speech. Without sophisticated artificial intelligence capable of figuring out context, a computer has no way of telling the difference between “The stuffy nose may dim liquor” and “The stuff he knows made him lick her.” Camillo believed there were images that could encapsulate vast and powerful concepts about the universe, and simply by memorizing those images, one would be able understand the hidden connections underlying everything. ## NUMBERS / CARDS A technique known as the “Major System,” invented around 1648 by Johann Winkelmann: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_system Convert numbers into phonetic sounds. Those sounds can then be turned into words, which can in turn become images for a memory palace. Memorizing long strings of numbers, “person-action-object,” or, simply, PAO. In the PAO system, every two-digit number from 00 to 99 is represented by a single image of a person performing an action on an object. Any six-digit number, like say 34-13-79, can then be turned into a single image by combining the person from the first number with the action from the second and the object from the third. It effectively generates a unique image for every number from 0 to 999,999. Those associations are entirely arbitrary, and have to be learned in advance, which is to say it takes a lot of remembering just to be able to remember. Memorize decks of playing cards in much the same way, using a PAO system in which each of the fifty-two cards is associated with its own person/action/object image. This allows any triplet of cards to be combined into a single image, and for a full deck to be condensed into just eighteen unique images. To be maximally memorable, one’s images have to appeal to one’s own sense of what is colorful and interesting. Before I could memorize any decks of cards, I first had to memorize those fifty-two images. No minor job. ## BRAIN Memories gradually decay with time along what’s known as the “curve of forgetting.” From the moment you grasp a new piece of information, your memory’s hold on it begins to slowly loosen, until finally it lets go altogether. Hermann Ebbinghaus first brought the study of memory into the laboratory in the 1870s. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus set out to quantify this inexorable process of forgetting. In order to understand how our memories fade over time, he spent years memorizing 2,300 three-letter nonsense syllables. At set periods, he would test himself to see how many of the syllables he’d forgotten and how many he’d managed to retain. When he graphed the results, he got a curve that looked like this (falling curve of spaced interfals.) No matter how many times he performed the experiment on himself, the results were always roughly the same: In the first hour after learning a set of nonsense syllables, more than half of them would be forgotten. After the first day, another 10 percent would disappear. After a month, another 14 percent. After that, the memories that were left had more or less stabilized - they had become consolidated in long-term memory - and the pace of forgetting slowed to a gentle creep. A memory is a pattern of connections between your neurons. No one has ever actually seen a memory in the human brain. The brain makes sense up close and from far away. It’s the in-between - the stuff of thought and memory, the language of the brain - that remains a profound mystery. ## OTHER Participatory journalism. Ed was an aesthete, in the true Oscar Wilde sense. He participated in life as if it were art, and practiced a studied, careful carefreeness. His sense of what is worthy seemed to overlap very little with any conventional sense of what is useful, and if there were one precept that could be said to govern his life, it is that one’s highest calling is to engage in enriching escapades at every turn. He was a genuine bon vivant. (Amnesiac:) Trapped in this limbo of an eternal present, between a past he can’t remember and a future he can’t contemplate, he lives a sedentary life, completely free from worry. “He’s happy all the time. Very happy. I guess it’s because he doesn’t have any stress in his life.” In his chronic forgetfulness, EP has achieved a kind of pathological enlightenment, a perverted vision of the Buddhist ideal of living entirely in the present.","For those fascinated with memory. Riveting page-turner about a journalist (with no particularly good memory) who went to cover a memory championship event. Intrigued and befriending some competitors, he starts practicing, and a year later wins the U.S. memory championship event himself. Inspiring dive into the subject of memorization."
Practicing Mind,Thomas Sterner,0977657205,8,"Self-discipline, focus, patience, and self-awareness are interwoven threads in the fabric of both true inner peace and contentment in life. Together, living in the present moment and being process-oriented is the path that leads us to these all- important virtues. Everything in life worth achieving requires practice. Life itself is one long practice session. I mistakenly only associated the word “practice” with art forms such as music, dance or painting. I did not see dealing with a cranky child, an over-burdened work schedule, or a tight monthly budget as actions that required applying the same principles as did learning music. I wanted the joy and benefits that are rewarded to the individual who perseveres at working towards a lofty personal goal. I wanted to experience the self-discovery that one attains from picking a goal and steadily working toward it. If you are not in control of your thoughts then you are not in control of yourself. Without self-control, you have no real power. The problem with patience and discipline is that it requires both of them to develop each of them. When given my present moment attention, the practice sessions were very calming, not bothersome. I didn't have to be anywhere but “here,” and I didn't have to accomplish anything but exactly what I was doing “right now.” It would keep my mind in the present, out of the past or the future. I would let go of any expectations of how long it would take me to acquire a good golf swing because I was enjoying what I was doing “right now,” learning a good golf swing. “practice” and “learning” are similar but not the same. The word “practice” implies the presence of awareness and will. The word learning does not. When we “practice” something we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. Practice encompasses learning but not the other way around. Your goal is focusing on the process or staying in the present. Then there are no mistakes and no judging. You are just learning and doing. You are executing the activity, observing the outcome and adjusting yourself and your practice energy to produce the desired result. Use the final goal as a rudder to steer your practicing session, but not as an indicator of how you are doing. We are mastering ourselves by staying in the process and mastering whatever activity we are working on. This is the essence of proper practice. ""What is a supervisor?"" asked the worker. ""Someone to make sure you do your job correctly,"" answered the retailer. ""Why would I need someone to make sure I do my job correctly? That's *my* job."" Instant gratification = short term satisfaction, because anything we acquire of this nature has no real lasting value to us. You can recall everything you have worked hard and patiently for in your life, but how many things that you have attained with little or no effort can you remember? When we focus our energy on the process of attaining something, whether it be an object or a skill, and through patience and discipline we achieve it, we experience a joy that is just not present when something comes too quickly or easily. At what point in a flower's life, from seed to full bloom, has it reached perfection? Ideal images of perfection, if they are used for inspiration, they can be very beneficial; but if they are used as a measuring device, they become our downfall. At any point in the day when you are involved in an activity and you notice you are feeling bored, impatient, rushed, or disappointed with your performance level, realize that you have left the present moment in your activity. Look at where your mind and energy are focused. You will find that you have strayed either into the future or the past. We are perfect when we are where we are and absorbed in what we are doing right at that moment. The reason we bother ourselves with such a life-long effort is not to be able to say “I have mastered the technique of present moment awareness.” This is an ego-based statement. We work at this for one reason: it brings us the inner peace and happiness that we cannot attain through the acquisition of any material object or cultural status. When we are practicing correctly, we are not aware we are practicing correctly. We are only aware and absorbed in the process of what we are doing in that moment. In Zen this is referred to as ""beginner's mind."" Part of this is because, when you are a beginner at whatever activity you are attempting to learn, it takes all of your concentration to accomplish the activity and your mind is empty of chatter. One of the best examples of this is to watch someone play a computer video game. You will see perfect practice in action. Video games offer a natural environment for pulling us into a state of focused present moment awareness. In a video game, the score is essentially the end result or product that the player is working for, but the game itself is where the fun is. The process of playing the game takes all of your attention. If you take more than a second to glance at the score, it can make or break your attempt to beat the computer at the game. He had become very present moment oriented. He found it increasingly difficult to plan future events because he was so wrapped up in what he was doing right now in this moment. What we practice is going to become habit. Become aware of what habits we are forming, we can begin to free ourselves by intentionally creating the habits we want. When we say that something is a habit, it means that it is the natural way we do something. We do it intuitively, without having to think about it. What is required is that you are aware of what you want to achieve, that you know the motions you must intentionally repeat to accomplish the goal, and that you execute your actions with no emotions or judgments; just stay on course. You should do this with the comfort of knowing that intentionally repeating something over a short course of time creates a new habit and can also replace an old one. This knowledge took so much of the stress out of learning something new for me. It became much easier to stay in the process of doing something, because I wasn’t experiencing all the anticipation that results from not having any idea of how long it would take to learn something new. I would just relax and repeat the exercise and stay in the process, knowing that the learning was occurring. Also in more personality-related changes: I would objectively decide where I wanted to end up and what motions were going to get me there. Next, I would work at that process without emotion, knowing that so many intentional repetitions over a short amount of time were going to create the behavior I was after. There was no need to fret over it. I would just stay with it and know that I was where I should be right “now” and becoming what I wanted to be. The more you experience it working, the more confidence you have in your ability to shape yourself and your life into whatever you want. Being aware that all of your motions are habit, be they physical or mental, and that you have the power to choose which habits you will create, is very liberating. You are in control. You need to keep reviewing these ideas so that you can hang on to the clarity and perspective. Otherwise, life steals it away. Thinking about a situation before you are in it only scatters your energy. “But I want to have my thoughts together before I get into the situation.” Fine, then take half an hour to sit down in a chair and do nothing else but go through the meeting in your mind and be there completely, doing only that. There is an endless nature to life. There is always more to be experienced. Deep down we know this and are glad for it. The problem is that everyday life steals this from us. It pulls us away from this perspective with a constant bombardment of advertisements all promising to fulfill us: “Get this, do that and life will be perfect.” We need to let go of this futile idea that happiness is out there somewhere, and embrace the infinite growth available to us as a treasure, not something that we are impatient to overcome. People involved in the arts understand this endless nature through direct experience. It is part of all the arts. That is why I believe that a personal pursuit in some form of art is so important to a person’s sense of well-being. It teaches you this true nature of life right up front if you pay attention. Progress is a natural result of staying focused on the process of doing anything. When you stay on purpose, focused in the present moment, the goal comes to you with frictionless ease. Cheating discipline doesn’t work. Achieving any personal goal means nothing if it comes with little or no effort. **** So many people miss this point. They look at the process of working for something as an annoying effort they have to go through to get what they want. They make getting the “thing” the goal instead of “getting there” the goal. “Just getting the thing” produces a very small return investment of inner joy compared with the process of “getting there and achieving the goal.” **** Let go of your attachment to the object you desire and make your desire the experience of staying focused on working toward your goal. This shift in perspective is very small and subtle on the one hand, but it has enormous freeing power. No task seems too large to undertake. Your confidence goes way up as does your patience with yourself. You are always achieving your goal and there are no mistakes or time limits to create stress. Break the overall goal down into small sections that can be achieved with a comfortable amount of concentration. Working slowly in today’s world goes against every thought system. You can only work slowly if you do it deliberately. Being deliberate requires you to stay in the process, to work in the present moment. Anything you can do in a rushing state is surprisingly easy when you deliberately slow it down. We must work at being more objectively aware of ourselves. We cannot refine any part of our daily thought processes if we are not separate from them. The one who is quietly aware is who you really are, the Observer. The more you become aligned to the quiet Observer, your true self, the less you judge. Your internal dialogue begins to shut down and you become more detached about the various external stimuli that come at you all day long. You begin to actually view your internal dialogue with an unbiased and sometimes amused perspective. Make a habit of detaching yourself and thereby use your privilege of conscious choice. Conscious participation in the whole process of seeing it coming, observing your internal dialogue with detachment and correcting my reaction. With every difficult situation, my inner response is, “This is when the fun begins, let’s go.” As adults, we usually feel that life is going too fast. We feel there is too much to do in too little time, and most of us long for the simplicity of our school days when we were young. The older you get, the faster time seems to go. Seasons and years feel as if they are flying by. The time between when you were ten and twenty years old seemed like a century, and yet the time between say thirty and forty feels like two or three years. Children don’t seem to have a sense of where they are going in life. There is today and that’s it. They live in the present moment, In every moment of your life your skills are growing. The question is, in which direction? When we make staying focused on the process our real goal, we experience a sense of success in every moment. Even when we feel we have fallen out of that focus on the process, the fact that we are aware of it means that we have come back into the present moment.","Great simple philosophy: Life itself is one long practice session. Everything in life worth achieving requires practice. Practice is not just for artistic or athletic skill, but practicing patience, practicing communication, practicing anything you do in life. The process/practice itself is the real goal, not the outcome."
Mindset,Carol Dweck,60191954,8,"Response to an academic failure - a poor test grade in a new course. Those with the growth mindset said they would study harder for the next test. Those with the fixed mindset said they would study less for the next test. If you don’t have the ability, why waste your time? College students, after doing poorly on a test, were given a chance to look at tests of other students. Those in the growth mindset looked at the tests of people who had done far better than they had. They wanted to correct their deficiency. But students in the fixed mindset chose to look at the tests of people who had done really poorly. That was their way of feeling better about themselves. As Procter & Gamble surged into the paper goods business, Scott Paper - which was then the leader - just gave up. Instead of mobilizing themselves and putting up a fight, they said, “Oh, well... at least there are people in the business worse off than we are.” John Wooden, the legendary basketball coach, says you aren’t a failure until you start to blame. What he means is that you can still be in the process of learning from your mistakes until you deny them. When people believe their basic qualities can be developed, failures may still hurt, but failures don’t define them. If abilities can be expanded - if change and growth are possible - then there are still many paths to success. The talented but erratic hare and the plodding but steady tortoise: The lesson was supposed to be that slow and steady wins the race. But, really, did any of us ever want to be the tortoise? No, we just wanted to be a less foolish hare. We wanted to be swift as the wind and a bit more strategic - say, not taking quite so many snoozes before the finish line. The story of the tortoise and the hare, in trying to put forward the power of effort, gave effort a bad name. It reinforced the image that effort is for the plodders and suggested that in rare instances, when talented people dropped the ball, the plodder could sneak through. As a society we value natural, effortless accomplishment over achievement through effort. We endow our heroes with superhuman abilities that led them inevitably toward their greatness. French executive Pierre Chevalier says, “We are not a nation of effort. After all, if you have savoir-faire [a mixture of know-how and cool], you do things effortlessly.” In the fixed mindset, everything is about the outcome. If you fail - or if you’re not the best - it’s all been wasted. The growth mindset allows people to value what they’re doing regardless of the outcome. This book is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. I read endless books and articles. The information was overwhelming. I’d never written in a popular way. It was intimidating. Does it seem easy for me? Way back when, that’s exactly what I would have wanted you to think. Now I want you to know the effort it took - and the joy it brought. Not only weren’t they discouraged by failure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning. Alfred Binet, inventor of the IQ test, did it for growth mindset, to help schools improve. The IQ test wasn't meant to summarize children’s unchangeable intelligence. It’s not nature or nurture, genes or environment. From conception on, there’s a constant give and take between the two. In fact, as Gilbert Gottlieb, an eminent neuroscientist, put it, not only do genes and environment cooperate as we develop, but genes require input from the environment to work properly. The hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development. This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you? The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. “I don’t divide the world into the weak and the strong, or the successes and the failures. I divide the world into the learners and nonlearners.” - Benjamin Barber Fixed mindset said the ideal mate would: Put them on a pedestal. Make them feel perfect. Worship them. In other words, the perfect mate would enshrine their fixed qualities. Growth mindset said the ideal mate would: See their faults and help them to work on them. Challenge them to become a better person. Encourage them to learn new things. People with the growth mindset thrive when they’re stretching themselves. When do people with the fixed mindset thrive? When things are safely within their grasp. If things get too challenging - when they’re not feeling smart or talented - they lose interest. When do you feel smart: when you’re flawless or when you’re learning? When NASA was soliciting applications for astronauts, they rejected people with pure histories of success and instead selected people who had had significant failures and bounced back from them. Edison was not a loner. For the invention of the lightbulb, he had thirty assistants, including well-trained scientists, often working around the clock in a corporate-funded state-of-the-art laboratory! Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training. This is so important, because many, many people with the fixed mindset think that someone’s early performance tells you all you need to know about their talent and their future. When students were praised for effort, 90 percent of them wanted the challenging new task that they could learn from. “You must have worked really hard.” They were not made to feel that they had some special gift; they were praised for doing what it takes to succeed. Praising ability lowered the students’ IQs. And that praising their effort raised them. 40 percent of the ability-praised students lied about their scores. In the fixed mindset, imperfections are shameful - especially if you’re talented - so they lied them away. What’s so alarming is that we took ordinary children and made them into liars, simply by telling them they were smart. I was single at the time, and he asked me what my plan was for finding a partner. He was aghast when I said I didn’t have a plan. “You wouldn’t expect your work to get done by itself,” he said. “Why is this any different?” It was inconceivable to him that you could have a goal and not take steps to make it happen. Think about your hero. Do you think of this person as someone with extraordinary abilities who achieved with little effort? Now go find out the truth. Find out the tremendous effort that went into their accomplishment - and admire them more. Michael Jordan was cut from the high school varsity team - we laugh at the coach who cut him. He wasn’t recruited by the college he wanted to play for (North Carolina State). Well, weren’t they foolish? He wasn’t drafted by the first two NBA teams that could have chosen him. What a blooper! Because now we know he was the greatest basketball player ever, and we think it should have been obvious from the start. When we look at him we see MICHAEL JORDAN. But at that point he was only Michael Jordan. A genius who constantly wants to upgrade his genius. People prize natural endowment over earned ability. The mark of a champion is the ability to win when things are not quite right - when you’re not playing well and your emotions are not the right ones. Personal success is when you work your hardest to become your best. Those with the growth mindset found setbacks motivating. They’re informative. They’re a wake-up call. In the fixed mindset, setbacks label you. Enron did a fatal thing: It created a culture that worshiped talent, thereby forcing its employees to look and act extraordinarily talented. Basically, it forced them into the fixed mindset. Good leaders: Constantly trying to improve, they surround themselves with the most able people they can find, they look squarely at their own mistakes and deficiencies, and they ask frankly what skills they and the company will need in the future. And because of this, they can move forward with confidence that’s grounded in the facts, not built on fantasies about their talent. The minute a leader allows himself to become the primary reality people worry about, rather than reality being the primary reality, you have a recipe for mediocrity, or worse. Instead of using the company as a vehicle for their greatness, they use it as an engine of growth - for themselves, the employees, and the company as a whole. Growth-minded manager - a guide, not a judge. The approved way to foster productivity was now through mentoring, not through terror. Fixed mindset, they felt judged and labeled by the rejection. Because the fixed mindset gives them no recipe for healing their wound, all they could do was hope to wound the person who inflicted it. “Tout comprendre c’est tout pardonner.” To understand all is to forgive all. Kids with the fixed mindset are the ones who react to taunting and bullying with thoughts of violent retaliation. Now you can have a fixed mindset about three things. You can believe that your qualities are fixed, your partner’s qualities are fixed, and the relationship’s qualities are fixed - that it’s inherently good or bad, meant-to-be or not meant-to-be. Now all of these things are up for judgment. The growth mindset says all of these things can be developed. All - you, your partner, and the relationship - are capable of growth and change. In the fixed mindset, the ideal is instant, perfect, and perpetual compatibility. Like it was meant to be. A good, lasting relationship comes from effort and from working through inevitable differences. Remember the fixed-mindset idea that if you have ability, you shouldn’t have to work hard? This is the same belief applied to relationships: If you’re compatible, everything should just come naturally. Every single relationship expert disagrees with this. People with a fixed mindset believe that a couple should share all of each other’s views. If you do, then you don’t need communication; you can just assume your partner sees things the way you do. Even a minor discrepancy threatened their belief that they shared all of each other’s views. Fixed mindset is the belief that problems are a sign of deep-seated flaws. Once people with the fixed mindset see flaws in their partners, they become contemptuous of them and dissatisfied with the whole relationship. Relationship expert Daniel Wile says that choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems. Never to think these fixed-mindset thoughts: My partner is incapable of change. Nothing can improve our relationship. These ideas, he says, are almost always wrong. My husband and I invented a third party, an imaginary man named Maurice. Whenever I start in on who’s to blame, we invoke poor Maurice and pin it on him. The whole point of marriage is to encourage your partner’s development and have them encourage yours. Helping partners, within the relationship, to reach their own goals and fulfill their own potential. This is the growth mindset in action. Shy growth-minded people looked on social situations as challenges. Even though they felt anxious, they actively welcomed the chance to meet someone new. It’s not that bullies are low in self-esteem, but judging and demeaning others can give them a self-esteem rush. Bullies also gain social status from their actions. Others may look up to them and judge them to be cool, powerful, or funny. Or may fear them. Either way, they’ve upped their standing. Stan Davis, a therapist, school counselor, and consultant, has developed an anti-bullying program that works. Building on the work of Dan Olweus, a researcher in Norway, Davis’s program helps bullies change, supports victims, and empowers bystanders to come to a victim’s aid. Within a few years, physical bullying in his school was down 93 percent and teasing was down 53 percent.","Crucial distinction: People in a “fixed” mindset believe that you *are* great or flawed. People in a “growth” mindset believe your greatness (or flaws) are because of your actions. The fixed mindset is very harmful in every area of life (work, art, relationships, business, etc.) We get our initial mindset from our environment. When parents say, “You are great,” instead of ”You did great work,” they accidentally create the “fixed” mindset."
Art and Fear,David Bayles and Ted Orland,0961454733,8,"This book is about what it feels like to sit in your studio or classroom, at your wheel or keyboard, easel or camera, trying to do the work you need to do. The work we have not done seems more real in our minds than the pieces we have completed. Making the work you want to make means finding nourishment within the work itself. The flawless creature wouldn’t need to make art. The disinterest of others doesn't reflect a gulf in vision. The overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that soars. Failed pieces are essential. You learn how to make your work by making your work, Artists don’t get down to work until the pain of working is exceeded by the pain of not working. — Stephen DeStaebler Quitting is fundamentally different from stopping. The latter happens all the time. Quitting happens once. Quitting means not starting again — and art is all about starting again. For 20 years, his single-minded quest was to land a one-man show at his city’s major art museum. He finally got it. And never produced a serious piece of art again. Don't let your current goal become your only goal. Leaving art school: Not many people continue making art when — abruptly — their work is no longer seen, no longer exhibited, no longer commented upon, no longer encouraged. Could you? ""No one understands my work. No one likes my work. I’m no good."" - These fears have less to do with art than they do with the artist. The first few brushstrokes to the blank canvas satisfy the requirements of many possible paintings, while the last few fit only that painting — they could go nowhere else. The development of an imagined piece into an actual piece is a progression of decreasing possibilities. The poem in the head is always perfect. Artists don’t daydream about making great art — they daydream about having made great art. Art is like beginning a sentence before you know its ending. Making art is chancy — it doesn’t mix well with predictability. Uncertainty is the essential, inevitable and all-pervasive companion to your desire to make art. And tolerance for uncertainty is the prerequisite to succeeding. The myth of the extraordinary provides the excuse for an artist to quit trying to make art, and the excuse for a viewer to quit trying to understand it. If there were some ongoing redefinition of “what chess is”, you’d probably feel a little uneasy trying to play chess. Of course you could always stick with the game by limiting yourself to a few easy moves you’ve seen work for others. Then again you might conclude that since you weren’t sure yourself what chess was, you weren’t a real chess player and were only faking it when you moved the pieces around. That moment of completion is also a moment of loss — the loss of all the other forms the imagined piece might have taken. The world is filled with people who were given great natural gifts, yet never produce anything. When that happens, the world soon ceases to care whether they are talented. Those who rely upon that gift alone, without developing further, peak quickly and soon fade to obscurity. Artists get better by sharpening their skills or by acquiring new ones; they get better by learning to work, and by learning from their work. The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work-and learning from their mistakes — the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. Some part of you dies when you stop making art. Your work tells you about your working methods, your discipline, your strengths and weaknesses, your habitual gestures, your willingness to embrace. The lessons you are meant to learn are in your work. To see them, you need only look at the work clearly — without judgement, without need or fear, without wishes or hopes. Without emotional expectations. Ask your work what it needs, not what you need. Then set aside your fears and listen. Ben Shahn: “It may be a point of great pride to have a Van Gogh on the living room wall, but the prospect of having Van Gogh himself in the living room would put a great many devoted art lovers to rout.” Try an insulating period: a gap of pure time between the making of your art, and the time when you share it with outsiders. (So it's not reflecting on *you*, just on the work that's in your past.) In the outside world there may be no reaction to what we do; in our artwork there is nothing but reaction. The breathtakingly wonderful thing about this reaction is its truthfulness. Look at your work and it tells you how it is when you hold back or when you embrace. When you are lazy, your art is lazy; when you hold back, it holds back; when you hesitate, it stands there staring, hands in its pockets. But when you commit, it comes on like blazes. We don’t learn much about making art from being moved by it. (Seeing others' art.) We may feel almost honor-bound to make art that recaptures the power of classics. Or feel tempted to use the same techniques, the same subjects, the same symbols as appear in the work that aroused our passion — to borrow, in effect, a charge from another time and place. If, indeed, for any given time only a certain sort of work resonates with life, then that is the work you need to be doing in that moment. If you try to do some other work, you will miss your moment. Post-modernist art is post-audience art. Power can't be borrowed across space and time. There’s a difference between meaning that is embodied and meaning that is referenced. No one should wear a Greek fisherman’s hat except a Greek fisherman. New ideas come into play far less frequently than practical ideas — ideas that can be re-used for a thousand variations, supplying the framework for a whole body of work rather than a single piece. When things go haywire, your best opening strategy might be to return — very carefully and consciously — to the habits and practices in play the last time you felt good about the work. The discovery of useful forms is precious. Once found, they should never be abandoned for trivial reasons. For most artists, making good art depends upon making lots of art, and any device that carries the first brushstroke to the next blank canvas has tangible, practical value. The hardest part of artmaking is living your life in such a way that your work gets done, over and over. Finding a host of practices that are just plain useful. A piece of art is the surface expression of a life lived within productive patterns. ""When bankers get together for dinner, they discuss art. When artists get together for dinner, they discuss money."" — Oscar Wilde By leading the viewer to experience the world through the very different sensibilities of the artist, a good work of art inevitably calls the viewer’s own belief system into question. Censorship is an entirely natural state of affairs. Nature places a simple constraint on those who leave the flock to go their own way: they get eaten. Healthy artistic environments are about as common as unicorns. ""When my daughter about seven years old, she asked me one day what I did at work. I told her I worked at the college — that my job was to teach people how to draw. She stared back at me, incredulous, and said, “You mean they forgot?”"" — Howard Ikemoto The dilemma facing academia is that it must accommodate not only students who are striving to become artists, but also teachers who are struggling to remain artists. If you chase two rabbits, you catch neither. What was the artist trying to achieve? Did they succeed? Was it worth doing? Provocative art challenges not only the viewer, but also its maker. Art that falls short often does so not because the artist failed to meet the challenge, but because there was never a challenge there in the first place. Think of it like Olympic diving: you don’t win high points for making even the perfect swan dive off the low board. ""For the beginner there are many paths, for the advanced, few."" - Zen proverb The progression of most artists’ work over time is a progression from art toward craft. An artist’s major discoveries usually come early on, and a lifetime is then allotted to fill out and refine those discoveries. Answers are reassuring, but when you’re onto something really useful, it will probably take the form of a question. The people with the interesting answers are those who ask the interesting questions.",For artists and musicians only: beautiful insights into the creative process.
Drive,Daniel Pink,1594488843,8,"When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity. Rewards can deliver a short-term boost - just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off - and, worse, can reduce a person’s longer-term motivation to continue the project. Human beings have an inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise their capacities, to explore, and to learn. But this third drive was more fragile than the other two; it needed the right environment to survive. One who is interested in developing and enhancing intrinsic motivation in children, employees, students, etc., should not concentrate on external-control systems such as monetary rewards. For too long, there’s been a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. The Motivation 2.0 operating system has endured for a very long time. Indeed, it is so deeply embedded in our lives that most of us scarcely recognize that it exists. For as long as any of us can remember, we’ve configured our organizations and constructed our lives around its bedrock assumption: The way to improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad. People in the open-source movement haven’t taken vows of poverty. For many, participation in these projects can burnish their reputations and sharpen their skills, which can enhance their earning power. Lakhani and Wolf uncovered a range of motives, but they found that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. The fun of mastering the challenge of a given software problem and the desire to give a gift to the programmer community. In April 2008, Vermont became the first U.S. state to allow a new type of business called the “low-profit limited liability corporation.” Dubbed an L3C, this entity is a corporation - but not as we typically think of it. L3C operate like a for-profit business generating at least modest profits, but its primary aim is to offer significant social benefits. Three other U.S. states have followed Vermont’s lead. Muhammad Yunus has begun creating what he calls “social businesses.” These are companies that raise capital, develop products, and sell them in an open market but do so in the service of a larger social mission - or as he puts it, “with the profit-maximization principle replaced by the social-benefit principle.” “For benefit” organizations, B corporations, and low-profit limited-liability corporations all recast the goals of the traditional business enterprise. Economics isn’t the study of money. It is the study of behavior. In the course of a day, each of us was constantly figuring the cost and benefits of our actions and then deciding how to act. Economists studied what people did, rather than what we said. Bruno Frey, an economist at the University of Zurich. An algorithmic task is one in which you follow a set of established instructions down a single pathway to one conclusion. That is, there’s an algorithm for solving it. A heuristic task is the opposite. Precisely because no algorithm exists for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution. Routine work can be outsourced or automated; artistic, empathic, nonroutine work generally cannot. People are much more likely to report having “optimal experiences” on the job than during leisure. Vocation Vacations. This is a business in which people pay their hard-earned money to work at another job. They use their vacation time to test-drive being a chef, running a bike shop, or operating an animal shelter. America alone now has more than 18 million of what the U.S. Census Bureau calls “non-employer businesses” - businesses without any paid employees. In the United States, 33.7 million people telecommute at least one day a month, and 14.7 million do so every day. He tells prospective employees: “If you need me to motivate you, I probably don’t want to hire you.” People have to earn a living. Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are what I call “baseline rewards.” If someone’s baseline rewards aren’t adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance. You’ll get neither the predictability of extrinsic motivation nor the weirdness of intrinsic motivation. You’ll get very little motivation at all. But once we’re past that threshold, carrots and sticks can achieve precisely the opposite of their intended aims. Mechanisms designed to increase motivation can dampen it. Tactics aimed at boosting creativity can reduce it. Programs to promote good deeds can make them disappear. Meanwhile, instead of restraining negative behavior, rewards and punishments can often set it loose - and give rise to cheating, addiction, and dangerously myopic thinking. A key motivational principle: “Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.” There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign. Only contingent rewards - if you do this, then you’ll get that - had the negative effect. Why? “If-then” rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy. Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That’s helpful when there’s a clear path to a solution. They help us stare ahead and race faster. The less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school, the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later. Painters and sculptors who were intrinsically motivated, those for whom the joy of discovery and the challenge of creation were their own rewards, were able to weather the tough times - and the lack of remuneration and recognition - that inevitably accompany artistic careers. Those artists who pursued their painting and sculpture more for the pleasure of the activity itself than for extrinsic rewards have produced art that has been socially recognized as superior. It is those who are least motivated to pursue extrinsic rewards who eventually receive them. Goals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy. But goals imposed by others - sales targets, quarterly returns, standardized test scores, and so on - can sometimes have dangerous side effects. Like all extrinsic motivators, goals narrow our focus. That’s one reason they can be effective; they concentrate the mind. But as we’ve seen, a narrowed focus exacts a cost. For complex or conceptual tasks, offering a reward can blinker the wide-ranging thinking necessary to come up with an innovative solution. Likewise, when an extrinsic goal is paramount - particularly a short-term, measurable one whose achievement delivers a big payoff - its presence can restrict our view of the broader dimensions of our behavior. The problem with making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters is that some people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road. By offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is undesirable. In environments where extrinsic rewards are most salient, many people work only to the point that triggers the reward - and no further. CARROTS AND STICKS: The Seven Deadly Flaws 1. They can extinguish intrinsic motivation. 2. They can diminish performance. 3. They can crush creativity. 4. They can crowd out good behavior. 5. They can encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior. 6. They can become addictive. 7. They can foster short-term thinking. Ensure that the baseline rewards - wages, salaries, benefits, and so on - are adequate and fair. Without a healthy baseline, motivation of any sort is difficult and often impossible. Rewards do not undermine people’s intrinsic motivation for dull tasks because there is little or no intrinsic motivation to be undermined. For some people, much of what they do all day consists of these routine, not terribly captivating, tasks. In these situations, it’s best to try to unleash the positive side of the Sawyer Effect by attempting to turn work into play - to increase the task’s variety, to make it more like a game, or to use it to help master other skills. When the artists considered their commissions “enabling” - that is, the commission enabled the artist to do something interesting or exciting - the creativity ranking of what they produced shot back up. The same was true for commissions the artists felt provided them with useful information and feedback about their ability. Your best approach is to have already established the conditions of a genuinely motivating environment. The baseline rewards must be sufficient. That is, the team’s basic compensation must be adequate and fair - particularly compared with people doing similar work for similar organizations. Your nonprofit must be a congenial place to work. And the people on your team must have autonomy, they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery, and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose. If these elements are in place, the best strategy is to provide a sense of urgency and significance - and then get out of the talent’s way. Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete. Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project - and offering it as a contingency - will inevitably focus people’s attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem. Deci and Ryan have fashioned what they call self-determination theory. We have three innate psychological needs - competence, autonomy, and relatedness. When those needs are satisfied, we’re motivated, productive, and happy. When they’re thwarted, our motivation, productivity, and happiness plummet. When people use rewards to motivate, that’s when they’re most demotivating. Instead, Deci and Ryan say we should focus our efforts on creating environments for our innate psychological needs to flourish. Hundreds of research papers point to the same conclusion. Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives. The Type B person may also have a considerable amount of drive, but its character is such that it seems to steady him, give confidence and security to him, rather than to goad, irritate, and infuriate, as with the Type A man. Taking an interest in work is as natural as play or rest, that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility. Intrinsically motivated people usually achieve more than their reward-seeking counterparts. Alas, that’s not always true in the short term. An intense focus on extrinsic rewards can indeed deliver fast results. The trouble is, this approach is difficult to sustain. And it doesn’t assist in mastery - which is the source of achievement over the long haul. The most successful people, the evidence shows, often aren’t directly pursuing conventional notions of success. They’re working hard and persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to control their lives, learn about their world, and accomplish something that endures. People oriented toward autonomy and intrinsic motivation have higher self-esteem, better interpersonal relationships, and greater general well-being than those who are extrinsically motivated. By contrast, people whose core aspirations are Type X validations such as money, fame, or beauty tend to have poorer psychological health. Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose. In a Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE) workplace, people don’t have schedules. They show up when they want. They don’t have to be in the office at a certain time - or any time, for that matter. They just have to get their work done. How they do it, when they do it, and where they do it is up to them. People still had specific goals they had to reach - for example, completing a project by a certain time or ringing up a particular number of sales. And if they needed help, the manager was there to assist. But he decided against tying those goals to compensation. “That creates a culture that says it’s all about the money and not enough about the work.” Money, he believes, is only “a threshold motivator.” The idea of management (that is, management of people rather than management of, say, supply chains) is built on certain assumptions about the basic natures of those being managed. It presumes that to take action or move forward, we need a prod - that absent a reward or punishment, we’d remain happily and inertly in place. It also presumes that once people do get moving, they need direction - that without a firm and reliable guide, they’d wander. But is that really our fundamental nature? Or, to use yet another computer metaphor, is that our “default setting”? When we enter the world, are we wired to be passive and inert? Or are we wired to be active and engaged? Perhaps management is one of the forces that’s switching our default setting and producing that state. Resist the temptation to control people - and instead do everything we can to reawaken their deep-seated sense of autonomy. Autonomy, as they see it, is different from independence. It’s not the rugged, go-it-alone, rely-on-nobody individualism of the American cowboy. It means acting with choice - which means we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent with others. And while the idea of independence has national and political reverberations, autonomy appears to be a human concept rather than a western one. A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude. According to a cluster of recent behavioral science studies, autonomous motivation promotes greater conceptual understanding, better grades, enhanced persistence at school and in sporting activities, higher productivity, less burnout, and greater levels of psychological well-being. Researchers at Cornell University studied 320 small businesses, half of which granted workers autonomy, the other half relying on top-down direction. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover. “As an entrepreneur, I’m blessed with 100% autonomy over task, time, technique and team. Here’s the thing: If I maintain that autonomy, I fail. I fail to ship. I fail to excel. I fail to focus. I inevitably end up either with no product or a product the market rejects. The art of the art is picking your limits. That’s the autonomy I most cherish. The freedom to pick my boundaries.” - SETH GODIN New hires at Zappos go through a week of training. Then, at the end of those seven days, Hsieh makes them an offer. If they feel Zappos isn’t for them and want to leave, he’ll pay them $2,000 - no hard feelings. Hsieh is hacking the Motivation 2.0 operating system like a brilliant and benevolent teenage computer whiz. He’s using an “if-then” reward not to motivate people to perform better, but to weed out those who aren’t fit for a Motivation 3.0-style workplace. Homeshoring: Instead of requiring customer service reps to report to a single large call center, they’re routing the calls to the employees’ homes. This cuts commuting time for staff, removes them from physical monitoring, and provides far greater autonomy over how they do their jobs. (JetBlue) After a job candidate has worked a thirty-day trial period on a team, the prospective teammates vote on whether to hire that person full-time. At W. L. Gore & Associates, the makers of the GORE-TEX fabric and another example of Motivation 3.0 in action, anybody who wants to rise in the ranks and lead a team must assemble people willing to work with him. People working in self-organized teams are more satisfied than those working in inherited teams. People want to be accountable - and that making sure they have control over their task, their time, their technique, and their team is a pathway to that destination. Human history has always moved in the direction of greater freedom. And there’s a reason for that - because it’s in our nature to push for it. Mastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters. “Throughout my athletics career, the overall goal was always to be a better athlete than I was at that moment - whether next week, next month or next year. The improvement was the goal. The medal was simply the ultimate reward for achieving that goal.” SEBASTIAN COE Middle-distance runner and two-time Olympic gold medal winner In flow, the relationship between what a person had to do and what he could do was perfect. The challenge wasn’t too easy. Nor was it too difficult. It was a notch or two beyond his current abilities, which stretched the body and mind in a way that made the effort itself the most delicious reward. That balance produced a degree of focus and satisfaction. Instead of meeting with their charges for once-a-year performance reviews, managers sat down with employees one-on-one six times a year, often for as long as ninety minutes, to discuss their level of engagement and path toward mastery. Jenova Chen, a young game designer who, in 2006, wrote his MFA thesis on Csikszentmihalyi’s theory. Chen believed that video games held the promise to deliver quintessential flow experiences. While most games require players to proceed through a fixed and predetermined series of skill levels, Chen’s allows them to advance and explore any way they desire. And unlike games in which failure ends the session, in Chen’s game failure merely pushes the player to a level better matched to her ability. Chen calls his game flOw. Incremental theorists consider intelligence as something like strength. (Want to get stronger and more muscular? Start pumping iron.) Entity theorists view it as something more like height. (Want to get taller? You’re out of luck.) If you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity, then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of how much you have. If you believe intelligence is something you can increase, then the same encounters become opportunities for growth. In one view, intelligence is something you demonstrate; in the other, it’s something you develop. The entity theory is a system that requires a diet of easy successes. In this schema, if you have to work hard, it means you’re not very good. People therefore choose easy targets that, when hit, affirm their existing abilities but do little to expand them. Those who did the best typically spent the most time and effort on the mundane activities. If people are conscious of what puts them in flow, they’ll have a clearer idea of what they should devote the time and dedication to master. Effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life. Effort means you care about something, that something is important to you and you are willing to work for it. Mastery is an asymptote. Why reach for something you can never fully attain? But it’s also a source of allure. Why not reach for it? The joy is in the pursuit more than the realization. In the end, mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes. Pursue purpose - and use profit as the catalyst rather than the objective. Imagine an organization, for example, that believes in affirmative action - one that wants to make the world a better place by creating a more diverse workforce. By reducing ethics to a checklist, suddenly affirmative action is just a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it isn’t discriminating. Now the organization isn’t focused on affirmatively pursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off to show that what it did is OK (and so it won’t get sued). Before, its workers had an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing, but now they have an extrinsic motivation to make sure that the company doesn’t get sued or fined. They’re busy making money and attending to themselves and that means that there’s less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count,” Ryan added. And if the broad contours of these findings are true for individuals, why shouldn’t they also be true for organizations - which, of course, are collections of individuals? A healthy society - and healthy business organizations - begins with purpose and considers profit a way to move toward that end or a happy by-product of its attainment. A great man is one sentence. At the end of each day, ask yourself whether you were better today than you were yesterday. Did you learn your ten vocabulary words, make your eight sales calls, eat your five servings of fruits and vegetables, write your four pages? Give ourselves our own performance reviews. Here’s how. Figure out your goals - mostly learning goals, but also a few performance goals - and then every month, call yourself to your office and give yourself an appraisal. How are you faring? Where are you falling short? What tools, information, or support might you need to do better? Seek constant, critical feedback. If you don’t know how you’re doing, you won’t know what to improve. Focus ruthlessly on where you need help. If someone is bored with his current assignment, see if he can train someone else in the skills he’s already mastered. Then see if he can take on some aspect of a more experienced team member’s work. Get compensation right - and then get it out of sight. Effective organizations compensate people in amounts and in ways that allow individuals to mostly forget about compensation and instead focus on the work itself. The most important aspect of any compensation package is fairness. And here, fairness comes in two varieties - internal and external. Internal fairness means paying people commensurate with their colleagues. External fairness means paying people in line with others doing similar work in similar organizations. Paying great people a little more than the market demands, Akerlof and Yellen found, could attract better talent, reduce turnover, and boost productivity and morale. The pay-more-than-average approach can offer an elegant way to bypass “if-then” rewards, eliminate concerns about unfairness, and help take the issue of money off the table. Providing an employee a high level of base pay does more to boost performance and organizational commitment than an attractive bonus structure. Imagine you’re a product manager and your pay is determined by these factors: your sales for the next quarter your sales in the current year the company’s revenue and profit in the next two years levels of satisfaction among your customers ideas for new products and evaluations of your coworkers. If you’re smart, you’ll probably try to sell your product, serve your customers, help your teammates, and, well, do good work. When metrics are varied, they’re harder to finagle. In addition, the gain for reaching the metrics shouldn’t be too large. When the payoff for reaching targets is modest, rather than massive, it’s less likely to narrow people’s focus or encourage them to take the low road. Collins suggests four basic practices for creating a culture where self-motivation can flourish: 1. Lead with questions, not answers 2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion 3. Conduct autopsies, without blame 4. Build ‘red flag’ mechanisms In other words, make it easy for employees and customers to speak up when they identify a problem. More Info: Collins’s website: jimcollins.com People at all levels stop doing any activity that is a waste of their time, the customer’s time, or their company’s time.","Essential for all managers. Deep surprising study of motivation at work. Extrinsic vs intrinsic. Work vs play. When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity."
On Writing,Stephen King,0743455967,8,"Writing is telepathy: We’re not even in the same year together, let alone the same room. Except we are together. We’re close. We’re having a meeting of the minds. All the arts depend upon telepathy to some degree, but I believe that writing offers the purest distillation. Writing is refined thinking. WORKING: Writing has always been best when it’s intimate, as sexy as skin on skin. Stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position. (How he knew his brother wasn't a real musician:) We never heard him taking off, surprising himself with something new, blissing himself out. And as soon as his practice time was over, it was back into the case with the horn. If there’s no joy in it, it’s just no good. It’s best to go on to some other area, where the deposits of talent may be richer and the fun quotient higher. Talent renders the whole idea of rehearsal meaningless; when you find something at which you are talented, you do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head. Even when no one is listening (or reading, or watching), every outing is a bravura performance, because you as the creator are happy. The work starts to feel like work, and for most writers that is the smooch of death. Writing is at its best - always, always, always - when it is a kind of inspired play for the writer. If no one says to you, “This is wonderful!,” you are a lot less apt to slack off or to start concentrating on the wrong thing... being wonderful, for instance, instead of telling the goddam story. In the end, it’s about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life, as well. It’s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. ADVERBS: When I use adverbs, it’s usually for the same reason any writer does it: because I am afraid the reader won’t understand me if I don’t. I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing. (On adverbs:) Your man may be floundering in a swamp, and by all means throw him a rope if he is. But there’s no need to knock him unconscious with ninety feet of steel cable. Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. To write adverbs is human, to write he said or she said is divine. GOOD WRITING: Language does not always have to wear a tie and lace-up shoes. The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story - to make him/her forget, whenever possible, that he/she is reading a story at all. The single-sentence paragraph more closely resembles talk than writing, and that’s good. Writing is seduction. Good talk is part of seduction. Good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the right instruments. If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. Most writers can remember the first book he/she put down thinking: I can do better than this. Hell, I am doing better than this! What could be more encouraging to the struggling writer than to realize his/her work is unquestionably better than that of someone who actually got paid for his/her stuff? One learns most clearly what not to do by reading bad prose - one novel like Asteroid Miners (or Valley of the Dolls, Flowers in the Attic, and The Bridges of Madison County, to name just a few) is worth a semester at a good writing school. Good writing, on the other hand, teaches the learning writer about style, graceful narration, plot development, the creation of believable characters, and truth-telling. Being flattened is part of every writer’s necessary formation. You cannot hope to sweep someone else away by the force of your writing until it has been done to you. Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work. Especially work. People love to read about work. God knows why, but they do. Thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and nearsighted. Overdescription buries him or her in details and images. The trick is to find a happy medium. Good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else. When a reader puts a story aside because it “got boring,” the boredom arose because the writer grew enchanted with his powers of description and lost sight of his priority, which is to keep the ball rolling. Norris’s books provoked a good deal of public outrage, to which Norris responded coolly and disdainfully: “What do I care for their opinions? I never truckled. I told them the truth.” Some people don’t want to hear the truth, of course, but that’s not your problem. What would be is wanting to be a writer without wanting to shoot straight. If I am able, even briefly, to give you a Wilkes’-eye-view of the world - if I can make you understand her madness - then perhaps I can make her someone you sympathize with or even identify with. The result? She’s more frightening than ever, because she’s close to real. If, on the other hand, I turn her into a cackling old crone, she’s just another pop-up bogeylady. In that case I lose bigtime, and so does the reader. The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. REWRITING: When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story. When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story. Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open. Your stuff starts out being just for you, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right, it belongs to anyone who wants to read it. Or criticize it, if you’re very lucky. Every book - at least every one worth reading - is about something. Your job during or just after the first draft is to decide what something or somethings yours is about. Your job in the second draft - one of them, anyway - is to make that something even more clear. But once your basic story is on paper, you need to think about what it means and enrich your following drafts with your conclusions. If I write rapidly, putting down my story exactly as it comes into my mind, only looking back to check the names of my characters and the relevant parts of their back stories, I find that I can keep up with my original enthusiasm and at the same time outrun the self-doubt that’s always waiting to settle in. I don’t see themes until the story’s done. Once it is, I’m able to kick back, read over what I’ve written, and look for underlying patterns. If I see some (and I almost always do), I can work at bringing them out in a second, more fully realized, draft of the story. Two examples of the sort of work second drafts were made for are symbolism and theme. Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story. You’ll find reading your book over after a six-week layoff to be a strange, often exhilarating experience. It’s yours, you’ll recognize it as yours, even be able to remember what tune was on the stereo when you wrote certain lines, and yet it will also be like reading the work of someone else, a soul-twin, perhaps. This is the way it should be, the reason you waited. It’s always easier to kill someone else’s darlings than it is to kill your own. WHERE TO WORK: The biggest aid to regular production is working in a serene atmosphere. Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn’t in the middle of the room. Life isn’t a support-system for art. It’s the other way around. It’s difficult for even the most naturally productive writer to work in an environment where alarms and excursions are the rule rather than the exception. The space can be humble (probably should be, as I think I have already suggested), and it really needs only one thing: a door which you are willing to shut. The closed door is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business; you have made a serious commitment to write and intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. By the time you step into your new writing space and close the door, you should have settled on a daily writing goal. Like your bedroom, your writing room should be private, a place where you go to dream. Habituate yourself, to make yourself ready to dream just as you make yourself ready to sleep by going to bed at roughly the same time each night and following the same ritual as you go. In both writing and sleeping, we learn to be physically still at the same time we are encouraging our minds to unlock from the humdrum rational thinking of our daytime lives. OTHER READING: Light in August (still my favorite Faulkner novel), The Shakespeares, the Faulkners, the Yeatses, Shaws, and Eudora Weltys. They are geniuses. Strunk and White offer the best tools and rules you could hope for, describing them simply and clearly, with a refreshing strictness.","Great thoughts about writing (mostly books) from one of the most successful writers ever. Oddly doubles as an autobiography, telling many stories about his life from childhood."
The Geography of Bliss,Eric Weiner,044669889X,8,"“If I draw a circle, most people, when asked what I have drawn, will say I have drawn a circle or a disc, or a ball. Very few people will say I’ve drawn a hole in the wall, because most people think of the inside first, rather than thinking of the outside. But actually these two sides go together - you cannot have what is ‘in here’ unless you have what is ‘out there.’ ” In other words, where we are is vital to who we are. By “where,” I’m speaking not only of our physical environment but also of our cultural environment. Culture is the sea we swim in - so pervasive, so all-consuming, that we fail to notice its existence until we step out of it. It matters more than we think. Veenhoven: the World Database of Happiness. “When Americans say it was great, I know it was good. When they say it was good, I know it was okay. When they say it was okay, I know it was bad.” Every country has its cocktail-party question. A simple one-sentence query, the answer to which unlocks a motherlode of information about the person you’ve just met. In the United States that question is, What do you do? In Britain it is, What school did you attend? In Switzerland it is, Where are you from? That is all you need to know about someone. John Helliwell, a Canadian economist, has spent many years studying the relationship between trust and happiness. He’s found the two to be inseparable. “You can’t feel properly engaged if you don’t trust the people you engage with on a regular basis. Engagement breeds trust; trust supports engagement. It’s a two-way flow; both parts are critical.” Or consider this statement: “In general, people can be trusted.” Studies have found that people who agree with this are happier than those who do not. Trusting your neighbors is especially important. Simply knowing them can make a real difference in your quality of life. One study found that, of all the factors that affect the crime rate for a given area, the one that made the biggest difference was not the number of police patrols or anything like that but, rather, how many people you know within a fifteen-minute walk of your house. Patience and boredom are closely related. Boredom, a certain kind of boredom, is really impatience. You don’t like the way things are, they aren’t interesting enough for you, so you decide - and boredom is a decision - that you are bored. Affluence breeds impatience and impatience undermines well being. You don’t see many impatient poor people. It’s not the crime per se that makes places unhappy. It’s the creeping sense of fear that permeates everyone’s lives, even those who have never been - and probably never will be - victims of crime. E. F. Schumacher said, “There are poor societies which have too little. But where is the rich society that says ‘Halt! We have enough!’” The word “travel” stems from the same root as “travail” does. For centuries, traveling was equated with suffering. Only pilgrims, nomads, soldiers, and fools traveled. “It comes down to trustworthiness.” I’d heard the same thing in Switzerland. Trust is a prerequisite for happiness. Trust not only of your government, of institutions, but trust of your neighbors. Several studies, in fact, have found that trust - more than income or even health - is the biggest factor in determining our happiness. Drukpa Kunley, the Divine Madman http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drukpa_Kunley “Ask yourself if you are happy and you cease to be so.” - John Stuart Mill, the nineteenth-century British philosopher who believed that happiness should be approached sideways, “like a crab.” We equate happiness with comfort, but is there really any connection? Is there a point where excess comfort actually dilutes our contentment? Doha has no 7-Elevens because Qataris have no need for the convenience of a convenience store. The servants - every Qatari has at least one - do the shopping, and, being servants, their convenience isn’t anyone’s concern. Travel, at its best, transforms us in ways that aren’t always apparent until we’re back home. The entire nation of Qatar is like a good airport terminal: pleasantly air-conditioned, with lots of shopping, a wide selection of food, and people from around the world. Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, said when asked what the main aim of his life had been: “To be a good ancestor.” Qataris have no culture. Frankly, I can’t blame them. If you spent a few thousand years scraping by in the desert, fending off the solid heat, not to mention various invading tribes, you wouldn’t have time for culture, either. Back then, life was too harsh for culture. Today, it is too comfortable for culture. Cities, creative urban milieux, are places of great social and intellectual turbulence, not comfortable places at all. Aristotle would clear up this moral confusion in an Athenian minute. Happiness, he believed, meant not only feeling good but doing good. Thus, the pedophile and the suicide bomber only thought they were happy. In fact, they were not happy at all. It will drive you nuts, this infinite cycle of pleasure and adaptation. Interestingly, there are two notable exceptions to the hedonic treadmill. Noise and big breasts. Studies have found that we never really get used to loud noises, despite prolonged exposure. Another study found that women who get breast implants never tire of the enjoyment it brings them, and presumably their companions feel the same. In every Indo-European language, the word for happiness is tied to the word for luck. The English word “happiness” comes from the old Norse word “hap,” or luck. When we have a mishap, we’ve had a spell of bad luck. In modern German, the word “glück” means both “happiness” and “luck.” You can crave for something very much but take little or no pleasure in it once you had it. (Smoking, alcohol, etc:) Wanting things we don’t like. If true, it pretty much demolishes the entire field of economics. So much of human misery can be explained by this crazy way we’re wired. We assume that our intense feelings of wanting something - a new car, winning the lottery - means that, once obtained, these things will make us happy. But that is a connection that, neurologically speaking, does not exist. We are disappointed but don’t learn from our disappointment because our software is flawed. It’s not faulty data but faulty programming that is holding us back, and that is much harder to rectify. Comfort is the revolutionaries’ worst enemy. Noël Coward got it right when he observed that interesting work is “more fun than fun.” Reykjavík: Iceland’s capital is not so much a small city as a cosmopolitan village. Most cities are bigger than necessary. Beyond a certain point, the liabilities of urban life start to outweigh the benefits. Young Icelanders are deciding for themselves what is quintessentially Icelandic. It is a wonderful thing to watch. To be present at the moment of creation. Every culture has many more words to describe negative emotional states than positive ones. In Reykjavík, as in fourteenth-century Florence, there is no creative elite. Art is produced and enjoyed by everyone. The Swiss suppress envy by hiding things. Icelanders suppress envy by sharing them. Icelandic musicians help one another out. If you are free to fail, you are free to try. Americans like to think that we, too, embrace failure, and it’s true, up to a point. We love a good failure story as long as it ends with success. The entrepreneur who failed half a dozen times before hitting the jackpot with a brilliant idea. The bestselling author whose manuscript was rejected a dozen times. In these stories, failure serves merely to sweeten the taste of success. It’s the appetizer. For Icelanders, though, failure is the main course. It is not the skills we actually have that determine how we feel but the ones we think we have. Martin Seligman, founder of the positive-psychology movement, discovered that happy people remembered more good events in their lives than actually occurred. Depressed people remembered the past accurately. Icelanders: There’s no one on the island telling them they’re not good enough, so they just go ahead and sing and paint and write. One result of this freewheeling attitude is that Icelandic artists produce a lot of crap. They’re the first to admit it. But crap plays an important role in the art world. In fact, it plays exactly the same role as it does in the farming world. It’s fertilizer. The crap allows the good stuff to grow. What’s wrong with being naïve? Wasn’t Christopher Columbus naïve? Wasn’t Gandhi naïve? Weren’t the 1969 New York Jets naïve? The world, I now conclude, would be a far better place with a bit more naïveté. In Iceland, being naïve is okay because you can always start over. You can determine how your life plays out by deciding where you live. Iceland: the attitude that no matter what, no matter how bleak life seems, things will always work out. And they usually do. Hotels are wonderful inventions, but they are not the ideal window to the soul of a nation. In fact, as my stay in Qatar demonstrated, they are designed to do exactly the opposite, to keep you and the country you’re visiting at a comfortable distance. In Moldova the relationship between host and guest is reversed. It is the guest’s obligation to make the host feel at ease. The glass being half full or half empty is dead wrong. What really matters is whether water is flowing into or out of the glass. They didn’t wake up every day and say, “Gee, I wish I had more freedom.” Freedom to do what? At least back then, people had jobs and a place to live. That was a kind of freedom, and they don’t have that now. Simply by counting the acts of kindness for one week, people become happier and more grateful. “Not my problem” is not a philosophy. It’s a mental illness. Right up there with pessimism. Other people’s problems are our problems. If your neighbor is laid off, you may feel as if you’ve dodged the bullet, but you haven’t. The bullet hit you as well. You just don’t feel the pain yet. Or as Ruut Veenhoven told me: “The quality of a society is more important than your place in that society.” In other words, better to be a small fish in a clean pond than a big fish in a polluted lake. Just as the Inuit are said to have many words for snow, the Thais have many words for smile. There is yim cheun chom, the I-admire-you smile, and yim thak thaan, the I-disagree-with-you-but-go-ahead-propose-your-bad-idea smile. There is yim sao, the sad smile. And my favorite: yim mai awk, the I’m-trying-to-smile-but-can’t smile. Thais, I suspect, are too busy being happy to think about happiness. People like to say that Bangkok isn’t the “real Thailand,” just as they say that New York is not the real America and Paris is not the real France. I think this is wrong. These cities did not materialize out of nothingness. They grew organically in the soil in which they were planted. They are not the exception to the rule but, rather, the rule on steroids. New York is America, only more so. The same is true of Bangkok. American-style introspection. When Brits and Americans get together, the conversation turns to the differences that bind us, differences not immediately apparent because of the common language that divides us. In America, every conversation is held as if it might be your last on Earth. Nothing is held back. In the UK, we don’t want to bother anyone. When someone dies, we don’t call the relatives to offer our sympathies because we’re afraid we might disturb them. We don’t want to be too loud, too American. Being too American, or American at all, is pretty much the worst thing a Brit can be. “American” is synonymous with pushiness, tactlessness, and puppy-dog earnestness. Watching Brits shed their inhibitions is like watching elephants mate. You know it happens, it must, but it’s noisy, awkward as hell, and you can’t help but wonder: Is this something I really need to see? Let’s say you’re on a flight, and there is a problem, an engine has caught fire. Would you want an optimistic pilot at the controls? Perhaps, but what you really want is a wise pilot. Wisdom born from years of experience. Part of positive psychology is about being positive, but sometimes laughter and clowns are not appropriate. Some people don’t want to be happy, and that’s okay. They want meaningful lives, and those are not always the same as happy lives. In Arab countries, it’s crucial to graciously accept many, many cups of tea before asking anything that might be construed as a substantive question. In India, I found that flattery was the way to get people to talk. In America, microphobia is extremely rare, and no such foreplay is necessary. If anything, the challenge is getting people to stop talking. British remain economical with their emotions. Personal information is doled out judiciously, like premium chocolate or fine wine. As any economist will tell you, scarcity creates value. So when a Brit opens up, exposes their wounds, where it hurts, this is more valuable, more meaningful, than when an American does it. British culture hinders happiness. The most obvious manifestation is the lack of hugging. The British don’t even hug their own mothers. Nearly all creators of utopia have resembled the man who has a toothache and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having a toothache. India does not disappoint. It captivates, infuriates, and, occasionally, contaminates. It never disappoints. Yes, there are cellphones and ATMs and Internet cafés, but none has made a dent in the bedrock of Indian culture. These latest foreign intruders are no different from the Mughals or the British or any of the other interlopers who over the centuries tried to subdue the subcontinent. India always emerged victorious, not by repelling these invaders but by subsuming them. They keep coming back to India. Why? Unpredictability. Fawning over someone else is just as counterproductive, and annoying, as fawning over yourself. Narcissism turned inside out is still narcissism. “The whole thing depends on a tiny little button,” he says, with a knowing gleam in his eyes. The audience laughs and applauds. When a guru says something like that, his words are imbued with deep significance, while if you or I said it people would just assume we’re talking about a tiny little button and nothing more. Thus, just as some people are famous for being famous, gurus are wise for being wise. They can’t go wrong. “When will India be corruption free?” “When you stand up and fight against corruption.” I like that answer. It was real, and it required action of the asker. There is nothing more deadly dull than the sound of prosperity. The dull hum of an air conditioner or the muffled clicks on a keyboard simply can’t compete with the melodic calls of hawkers at an open-air market or the rhythmic clickity-clack of a sweatshop’s sewing machines. Even Third World traffic, with its symphony of honking horns and tinkling bells, beats the monotonous whoosh of a modern freeway. If you want to know India, just stand on a street corner, any street corner, and spin around 360 degrees. You will see it all. The best and worst of humanity. The ridiculous and the sublime. The profane and the profound. India. This is the country where, as Mark Twain observed, every life is sacred, except human life. Indians may care deeply about their families and circle of friends, but they don’t even notice anyone outside that circle. That’s why Indian homes are spotless, while just a few feet outside the front door the trash is piled high. It’s outside the circle. Sundar Sarukkai wrote an article about happiness that caught my eye. In one short paragraph he managed to capture a paradox that has been nagging me for some time: “Desire is the root cause of sorrow but desire is also the root cause of action. How do we counter the paralysis of action when there is no desire to motivate us?” We sit there at Khoshy’s and talk for a good hour or two. There is no rush, no agenda. It’s unpredictable, but in a good way. Time feels expansive. This, I realize, is what I love about India. The hidden little gems amid the grubbiness and the squalor and the greed. I am, dare I say, happy. One Shanti Road is the happiest place in India. All talk of paradise only starts when something has been lost. Staying in a place too long is like staying in a relationship too long. You grow bitter, and the chances of domestic violence increase. Reconciliation becomes impossible. The problem with hedonic floaters and with many of us Americans and our perpetual pursuit of happiness. We may be fairly happy now, but there’s always tomorrow and the prospect of a happier place, a happier life. So all options are left on the table. We never fully commit. That is, I think, a dangerous thing. We can’t love a place, or a person, if we always have one foot out the door. One simple question, he said, the answer to which identifies your true home. That question is: “Where do you want to die?”","Cranky NPR reporter dives deep into Iceland, Bhutan, Qatar, Holland, Switzerland, Thailand, India and Moldova to find out why people are happy (or not) in each. So beautifully written with astounding insights into culture and happiness. Amazing. Been thinking about it for weeks afterwards."
The Investor's Manifesto,William J. Bernstein,81955425,8,"The recent economic and market debacle is a great “teachable moment”, and it may represent the best investment opportunity in a generation. Our homes are best viewed as a consumption item, not as an investment. Finance is a relatively circumscribed field; not that much is really known for certain. The body of knowledge that the individual investor, or even the professional, needs to master is pitifully small. As in the depths of the Great Depression, there are now generous returns to be had for the brave, the disciplined, and the liquid. If there was ever a time to own a prudent portfolio that includes equities for the long term, it is now. I have come to the sad conclusion that only a tiny minority will ever succeed in managing their money even tolerably well. Successful investors need four abilities. #1 - an interest in the process #2 - more than a bit of math horsepower, far beyond simple arithmetic and algebra, or even the ability to manipulate a spreadsheet. Mastering the basics of investment theory requires an understanding of the laws of probability and a working knowledge of statistics. #3 - a firm grasp of financial history, from the South Sea Bubble to the Great Depression. #4 - the emotional discipline to execute their planned strategy faithfully, come hell, high water, or the apparent end of capitalism as we know it. I expect no more than 10 percent of the population passes muster on each of the above counts. This suggests that as few as one person in ten thousand (10 percent to the fourth power) has the full skill set. Wall Street is littered with the bones of those who knew just what to do, but could not bring themselves to do it. No matter how well an investor masters the theory of investing, he or she is lost if he or she lacks the ability to coolly observe extraordinary current events and say “I’ve seen this movie before, and I know how it ends.” It never occurred to them to consider the longer span of data or the broad narrative sweep of financial history. Had they done so, they would have realized that about once every decade the wheels come completely off the machinery of the markets, and the old relationships among various kinds of investments, which they profited so mightily from, temporarily reverse with a vengeance. The point is not to predict when such calamities can occur - that is impossible - but simply to know that they will occur from time to time, and that you should design your long-term investment strategy appropriately. There is no greater truism in investing than this: The less you pay for an asset, the more money you are likely to make when you eventually sell it. A fall in price, under most circumstances, should lead to a higher expected return. I emphasize three main principles: #1 - to not be too greedy #2 - to diversify as widely as possible #3 - to always be wary of the investment industry Investment return, referred to interchangeably as the “cost of capital” or the “interest rate”. For every consumer of capital, there is, more or less, a provider of capital. That is where you, the investor - the provider of capital - come into the story. In the jargon of finance, the “cost of capital” to its consumers is exactly the same as the return to the investor, and as an investor, only by understanding the risks and rewards of the consumers of your capital can you truly understand the process. For these three reasons - the increased possibility of loss, the difficulty of estimating future profits, and the residual nature of equity ownership - a substantial return premium should be demanded by equity owners. This is the “equity risk premium”. Investment return and the cost of capital for business ventures are flip sides of the same coin. In the course of earning those higher returns, your portfolio is going to lose a truckload of money from time to time. While the 2000-2001 decline was triggered when overextended, overenthusiastic tech companies ran out of cash, the current one began when overextended, overenthusiastic consumers ran out of credit. Diversification among different kinds of stock asset classes works well over the years and decades, but often quite poorly over weeks and months. Investors who can earn an 8 percent annualized return will multiply their wealth tenfold over the course of 30 years. If they have half a brain, they will care little that many days, or even years, along the way their portfolios will suffer significant losses. In the world of finance, the only black swans are the history that investors have not read. Investors who cannot approach the expected-return problem rationally and systematically are better off putting half of their money under the mattress, then lighting the rest on fire and throwing it out the window. Using historical returns to estimate future ones is an extremely dangerous exercise. It is even more dangerous to base financial planning decisions on the post-1925 database, a common zinger committed by many researchers and finance writers. Stocks do relatively well during long periods of inflation, since companies can raise the prices of the goods and services they sell. “Expected return,” one of the most important concepts in finance. Stocks and bonds work the same way as the roulette table, except that the expected payoff is almost always positive. If it were not positive, no one would invest. It is still roulette, but now the investor is the house. He will never know precisely what Lady Luck will dole out, but he can make a pretty good guess of the payout, particularly over future periods of at least two decades. U.S. Treasury securities issued with a maturity of one year or less are called “bills”; from one to 10 years, “notes”; and over 10 years, “bonds.” Notes and bonds yield an interest coupon every six months. Bills do not - rather, they are issued at a discount and redeemed at par; the difference is their “yield.” The investor estimates the expected returns of bonds simply by starting with the interest coupon, then subtracting out the failure rate. If 10-year corporate bonds yield 7 percent, but 5 percent of them per year fail, leaving us with the 2 percent Treasury return, this is not even-Steven. No, not even close: The corporate bonds churned our stomachs and kept us awake at night, whereas the T-note holders slept like babies. The single most reliable indicator of fraud is the promise of high return with low risk. With stocks, the estimation of future expected returns is the same, except that we start with the dividend yield, then add the growth rate of those dividends. Important rule of finance: Always think in after-inflation, or “real” terms; this avoids having to correct later for the effect of long-term inflation. In the end, focusing on real returns streamlines thinking and helps investors tune out the noise they will hear about how inflation “corrodes wealth.” The U.S. economy grows, on average, about 3 percent per year in real terms, and total corporate profits grow along with it at roughly the same 3 percent long-term real rate. Brokerage houses and mutual fund companies often tout the stocks of emerging-market nations, such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (the so-called BRIC countries) because of their rapid economic growth. But beware: Share dilution, and often outright theft because of lax security laws, vaporizes a lot of this growth by the time it reaches the per-share level. For example, China’s economy has been growing at a blistering 9 percent real rate per year for more than two decades. Yet between 1993 and 2008 investors actually lost 3.3 percent per year in Chinese stocks, even with dividends reinvested. You read that right: Over this 16-year period, even before expenses, the investor in Chinese stocks lost 41.5 percent of value.4 (The loss of 3.3 percent per year before inflation calculates out to a loss of 5.7 percent per year after inflation.) The same is also true, to a lesser extent, for the smaller “tiger” nations of East Asia: Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand, all of which had lower equity returns than the more slowly growing economy of the United States. Do not trust historical data - especially recent data - to estimate the future returns of stocks and bonds. Instead, rely on interest and dividend payouts and their growth/failure rates. We can now finally estimate the real expected returns of equities. As we have already seen, in the case of the S&P 500, it is as easy as adding the approximately 2.5 percent current yield of this index to the 1.32 percent real dividend growth rate to get an expected real return of slightly less than 4 percent. This simple computation - simply adding together the dividend yield and growth rate - is known as the Gordon Equation, Stocks have sold for as low as about seven times dividends (in 1932) and as high as 90 times (in 2000). The market price is but a pale imitation of the real deal: the pleasure or income stream an asset delivers over time, discounted by the appropriate rate of interest for how far in the future each part of that income accrues. A pleasure enjoyed today is almost always worth more than one enjoyed in the future. Fisher elegantly calls this the “impatience” for the item in question; it is synonymous with the rate of interest. r = D/P + g which is the Gordon Equation: Return = Dividend Yield + Growth. What now? Many observers feel that most asset classes are at least fairly valued, and that some, such as European stocks and REITs, are downright cheap. If these observers are correct and prices mean revert up, then returns should be even higher than calculated by the Gordon Equation. The 4 percent expected return we have just calculated for stocks is a real return. This means that the value of the portfolio after taking inflation into account - its actual purchasing power - should, on average, double every 18 years. At the present time, many foreign equity markets yield around 5 percent. Even if their real per-share earnings do not grow at all, their real expected returns should be quite agreeable going forward: the 5 percent dividend. In early 2009, the best real REIT return that investors could reasonably hope for was 10 percent; if substantial numbers fail over the next several years, or even if they grow more slowly than in the past, this return could be lower. (As this is being written, REIT dividend payouts are falling rapidly; if, and how much, they recover will in large part determine their future returns.) Always favor expected returns calculated from the Gordon Equation over past returns, no matter how long of a period they cover. This goes double whenever the markets are gripped by the euphoria of a bubble, as occurred in the late 1990s, or are in the throes of a panic, as happened in 2008-2009. If one of life’s secrets is to be keep your head when all those around you are losing theirs, then the Gordon Equation is the collar that will keep it there. The Gordon Equation currently suggests that there are better returns to be earned in both stocks and corporate bonds for the first time in more than a decade, perhaps in the range of 4 to 8 percent real returns for stocks of various kinds, and 2 percent real returns for bonds. Investment is the deferral of present consumption for future consumption, and if anything qualifies as present consumption, it is a residence. A home or condominium’s price should increase over time. How much? The best data on house prices suggest that, after taking inflation into account, the answer is slim to none. Home ownership is not an investment; it is exactly the opposite, a consumption item. After taking into consideration maintenance costs and taxes, you are often better off renting. A vacation home makes little financial sense unless you are leasing it out for most of the year. So if you must have a place in the mountains or on the beach, rent, do not buy. Are there other risk premiums to be earned by intelligent, brave, and disciplined investors? There appear to be at least two more: the “value” and “small” factors. Good companies most often are bad stocks, and bad companies, as a group, are good stocks. U.S. small and value stocks have expected real returns of about 5 to 6 percent; for small value stocks, which have both risk factors, about 6 to 8 percent. At a 2 percent withdrawal rate, your nest egg will survive all but catastrophic institutional and military collapse; at 3 percent, you are probably safe; at 4 percent, you are taking real chances; and at 5 percent and beyond, you should consider annuitizing most, if not all, of your nest egg. For every seller there is a buyer, and vice versa. All that changes is the price at which market transactions occur. When the news or sentiment about a stock improves, the price must rise to the point where eager buyers can induce the stock’s holders to part with it. When news or sentiment about a given stock deteriorates, the price must fall to the point where potential buyers become convinced that they will be adequately compensated for the purchase. Few should own an all-stock portfolio. Always consider Pascal’s Wager: What happens to my portfolio - and to my future - if my assumptions are wrong? Suppose they go all-in with stocks and they are wrong. Then they are ruined. Wise investors hedge their bets with a large amount of bonds, since the consequences of being wrong with this choice are not nearly as dire as being wrong with an all-stock portfolio. The heart of the investing process: The goal is not to maximize the chances of getting rich, but rather to simultaneously allow for a comfortable retirement and to minimize the odds of dying poor. The reason why 90 percent of investors and fund managers cannot pick stocks is simple: Whenever you buy or sell a stock or bond, there is someone on the other side of that trade, and that someone most likely has a name like Goldman Sachs, PIMCO, or Warren Buffett. There is even something worse than trading with Buffett, and that is trading with a top executive of the company whose stock you are buying or selling, and who likely knows more about its condition and prospects than even the smartest and best-informed security analyst. Trading individual stocks is like playing tennis against an invisible opponent; what you don’t realize is that you are volleying with the Williams sisters. “Efficient Market Hypothesis” (EMH) which states, more or less, that all known information about a security has already been factored into its price. This has two implications for investors: First, stock picking is futile, to say nothing of expensive, and second, stock prices move only in response to new information - that is, surprises. Since surprises are by definition unexpected, stocks, and the stock market overall, move in a purely random pattern. The implications of the EMH for the investor could not be clearer: Do not try to time the market, and do not try to pick stocks or fund managers. Mr. Buffett is not so much a money manager as a businessman; when he buys a company, he moves into a metaphorical corner office and helps manage it. Over the decade ending December 2008, his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has returned an annualized +3.27 percent. A respectable performance compared to the S&P 500’s -1.38 percent, but remember, Mr. Buffett is a value investor, and while he beat the passively managed DFA Large Value Fund, which returned +2.15 percent, for the period, he lagged the DFA Small Value Fund, which returned +7.55 percent. “indexed” and “passively managed.” These are not quite the same. The former means that a fund buys all of the stocks in an index, such as the S&P 500, whose composition is determined by a committee within Standard & Poor’s Inc. Once each year, this committee replaces several of the 500 companies in the index; so too must any S&P 500 index fund. From the index fund perspective, this is a messy and somewhat expensive process, since funds following the S&P 500 must all scramble at the same time to sell the stocks exiting the index and buy the ones entering it. The Russell 2000 index has an even more severe problem, since there is no mystery about the selection process, and speculators can easily predict which companies are going to be added and dropped on the changeover date. Just before this, these speculators will buy up the added companies and sell the deleted ones, bidding up and down their prices, respectively. This “front-running” dearly costs index funds tied to the Russell 2000. By contrast, a “passively managed” fund essentially creates its own private index, specifically designed to keep turnover to a bare minimum. DFA uses this approach exclusively, then takes it one step further by purchasing stocks meeting its selection criteria that typically involve total market capitalization and the book value of the company’s assets. After DFA has defined the list of stocks it can own, it proceeds to buy only those that can be transacted cheaply, thus preventing speculators from “stepping in front of” their purchases. Other fund companies solve the “indexing problem” by using less-popular indexes; Vanguard, after a royalties dispute with S&P, switched most of its index funds over to the Morgan Stanley Capital Indexes (MSCI) system, which relatively few other index funds use. Fund companies can also employ a “total market” index that has almost no turnover. The most popular of these is the Wilshire 5000. This index, which originally contained the 5,000 largest U.S. companies, now encompasses 6,700 names and essentially owns the entire universe of domestic stocks. In taxable accounts, active management incurs an additional penalty: High portfolio turnover realizes capital gains on which the shareholder must pay taxes. There is nothing magical about passive and indexed investing; any active manager who charges low fees, is highly diversified, and keeps stock turnover to a bare minimum should provide value to his or her investors. During periods of extreme economic or political turbulence, risks will seem high. This will depress the prices of both stocks and risky bonds and thus raise their future returns. Stocks and risky bonds bought at such times generally earn the highest long-term returns; stocks and risky bonds bought in times of calm and optimism generally earn the lowest long-term returns. Understand four things: save as much as you can, make sure you have enough liquid taxable assets for emergencies, diversify widely, and do so with passive or index funds. Always remember the textbook definition of investment: the deferral of current consumption for future consumption. If you cannot defer current consumption, you will die poor, even if you are possessed of Warren-Buffett-like investment acumen. Save as much as you can, and do not stop saving until you die. This book most definitely does not deal in detail with money needed in less than five years, such as saving for a house down payment. Here, the play book is very thin: Keep such funds in the safest, short-duration vehicles as possible. Yes, picking a small number of stocks increases your chances of getting rich, but as we just learned, it also increases your chances of getting poor. By buying and holding the entire market through a passively managed or indexed mutual fund, you guarantee that you will own all of the winning companies and thus get all of the market return. True, you will own all of the losers as well, but that is not as important; the most that can vanish with any one stock is 100 percent of its purchase value, whereas the winners can easily make 1,000 percent, and exceptionally 10,000 percent, inside of a decade or two. Miss just one or two of these winning stocks, and your entire portfolio will suffer. The Gordon Equation for U.S. stocks in 2009: The expected return is currently a 2.5 percent yield plus the 1.32 percent historical dividend growth rate. Thus, the ongoing dividend stream, not its expected growth, provides the lion’s share of return. Question: If you had your own choice, which would you prefer? Choice A: Stocks go up by quite a lot - and stay up for many years. Choice B: Stocks go down by quite a lot - and stay down for many years. This is a trick question, of course. While most investors would pick choice A, the long-term investor should clearly prefer choice B. Just as we buy cows for their milk and hens for their eggs, we buy stocks for their current and future dividends. If you ran a dairy, wouldn’t you prefer to have cow prices low when you were buying, so you could get more gallons of milk for your investment in cows? The conventional wisdom that young people should invest more aggressively than older individuals is quite correct. Younger investors should own a higher portion of stocks because they have the ability to apply their regular savings to the markets at depressed prices. More precisely, young investors possess more “human capital” than financial capital; that is, their total future earnings dwarf their savings and investments. Since young workers can be said to be the owners of a huge bond-like asset, their human capital, they can hold most, if not all, of their investment capital as stocks. Or so the theory goes. Vanguard: the Total World Stock Index Fund. I do not recommend it, however. The 44/56 United States/foreign split of this fund, and of its underlying index, is too foreign-heavy for my taste for three reasons. First, unless you are living abroad, you are going to be spending mainly dollars in retirement, and the foreign stocks will expose you to the risk of depreciation of the euro, yen, pound, and other foreign currencies. Second, not only are foreign stocks riskier than U.S. stocks, they are also more expensive to own. It costs more to transact abroad, and many foreign governments tax stock dividends; although you can recover this cost in a taxable account through the foreign tax credit on your U.S. tax return, you cannot do so in a retirement account. Last, the fund’s fees are higher than they need to be, uncharacteristic of a Vanguard offering. At a 0.50 percent expense ratio plus a 0.25 percent purchase fee, an investor can separately buy its components - the United States and international stock markets - much more cheaply. Investors can occasionally lose return with rebalancing, as would have occurred in the 1990s with Japanese and U.S. stocks, when the former went nearly straight down, and the latter went nearly straight up. In that case, the investor would have been continually selling what was the best future performer and buying the worst future performer. These caveats aside, over the long haul portfolio rebalancing, on average, adds value and certainly reduces risk, taking money off the table when a given asset class, or stocks in general, are on a tear and become overvalued. REITs. How much? Probably no more than 10 percent of the equity allocation: 6 percent overall of a 60/40 portfolio, for example. Tease apart the foreign stocks into those of developed nations and those of emerging-market nations, which often have very different returns. Consider adding some more risk premiums by increasing exposure to value stocks and to small stocks by dividing the equity asset classes into four corners: large market, small market, large value, and small value. Ignore the large growth and small growth categories, which have lower expected returns. If you have a large portfolio, in excess of $250,000-$500,000, and you can handle the complexity, then you might want to split your domestic and foreign developed market allocation into a small- and value-weighted “four corners portfolio”. Commodities futures: Two things are wrong with this asset class. First, its future returns will likely be low - certainly much lower than they have been in the past; commodities are what I call an “asset class du jour,” on everyone’s financial lips. This is a real warning sign, since when everyone owns something, few buyers may be left to push up the price. Second, I just do not trust any of the commodities funds, or the companies offering them. The stocks of gold, silver, and platinum mining companies provide much of the same diversification benefits as commodities futures. I am less enthusiastic about them now than I was a few years ago for two reasons. First, my old favorite in this area, the Vanguard Precious Metals and Mining Fund, has broadened its charter to invest in companies that mine base metals (mainly aluminum, copper, and lead) and other natural resources, and this significantly decreases its diversification value. Second, gold and gold stocks have also become an asset class du jour, with high recent returns and a good deal of publicity. Unless you are going on the lam, buying gold bullion itself, gold coins, or an ETF that invests in them, is rarely a good idea. The long-term, real return of the yellow metal itself is zero - an ounce of it bought a fine men’s suit in Shakespeare’s time, and still does today. In addition, gold yields no dividend and incurs storage costs. Another asset class worthy of consideration is international REITs - property companies in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Like U.S. REITs, they have suffered recent massive price falls, and consequently yield dividends in excess of 8 percent. They may also offer even more diversification than their domestic cousins. Their only drawback is that they are only available in passive funds to independent small investors in ETF form, and thus incur commissions and spreads. Since this asset class should not constitute more than a few percent of anyone’s assets, I do not recommend including it in a portfolio unless its size is at least several hundred thousand dollars, and you can tolerate a highly complex mix of assets. In every field of human endeavor, whether it is flying, medicine, or armed combat, this reflexive/reflective split cleaves the world into amateurs and professionals, the former driven by their emotions, the latter by calculation and logic. Investors also need to master their emotions. Nothing is more likely to make you poor than your own emotions; nothing is more likely to save your finances than learning how to use cool, dispassionate reason to hold these emotions in check. ""Druggy LaRoche Pharmaceuticals has just come out with a world-beating antibiotic, threeblindmycin. My patients love it, and I think it’s the next Viagra. I’m buying as much of the stock as I can get my hands on. Discounted cash flow? Intrinsic value versus current stock price? Don’t bother me with silly details."" The financial institutions on the other side of his stock purchases, naturally, have done the hard math and have decided to sell their Druggy LaRoche stock to our story-telling physician. Bonds of all stripes - except everybody’s current favorite, Treasury securities - should also do just fine, as long as the investor keeps maturities relatively short (less than five years) to mitigate the risk of unexpected high inflation. Learn to automatically mistrust simple narrative explanations of complex economic or financial events. Popular finance books provide an excellent barometer of uninformed narrative-borne public sentiment, since ambitious financial authors tend to pander to it. Why folks bought IPOs: It is so much more fun taking a chance on finding the next Amazon.com or Microsoft than owning a doggy industrial company. In short, IPOs are the investment equivalent of a lottery ticket, with high entertainment value and low investment returns. If you want excitement in your life, it is far safer and cheaper to take up skydiving than to seek it in your investment portfolio. The more public visibility a company has, and the more well-known and entertaining its story, the lower its future returns are likely to be. Because it arises from our fast-moving limbic system, fear is also a short-term phenomenon. It makes little sense that we should care about a bad day or a bad year in the stock market if it provides us with good long-term returns. But because of the importance of our limbic systems, we care - very, very much - about short-term losses. We cannot help it: That is the way we are hardwired. Between 1929 and 2008, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51.6 percent of days and fell 48.4 percent of days. If one day of losses offsets two days of gains in our psyches, then on average we would feel horrible, since the number of gaining and losing days is nearly equal. Only when we check our portfolios less than once per year do we finally clear the grim psychological two-to-one hurdle. The same thing that is true about individual companies and their stocks is also true of the economies and stock markets of entire nations. When you invest abroad, should you not favor those economies that are growing most rapidly? Actually, no. It turns out that this naive strategy will cost you plenty. For example, in Chapter 2 we saw that, since 1993, China has had one of the world’s highest economic growth rates - at times exceeding 10 percent per year. Yet between 1993 and 2008, its stock market has lost 3.3 percent per year. We also have already learned that, to a lesser degree, the same is true for the other great economic success stories of the past few decades, the Asian tigers - Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand - which since 1988 have all had lower returns than in the low-growth United States. By contrast, no major nation has seen its relative economic and geopolitical position fall farther during the twentieth century than the United Kingdom. In 1900, Britannia not only ruled the waves, but the world’s financial markets as well. In 2000, by contrast, it was little more than an open-air theme park playing second fiddle to the American hegemon. Once again, this had no impact on British equity returns, which were among the world’s highest during the twentieth century. Nations with the most rapidly growing economies often have the lowest stock returns. In many developing markets, governments do not protect shareholders from the rapacity of management as well as in nations with more established legal systems. In other words, in these countries, management and controlling shareholders find it disturbingly easy to loot a company. Nothing lasts forever: More often than not, recent extraordinary economic and financial events tend to reverse. In an environment filled with incredibly smart, hard-working, and well-informed participants, the smartest trading strategy is not to trade at all. Those suffering from major depression often have the most accurate self-assessments of their own abilities. We require a certain amount of self-delusion in order to maintain our self-esteem. Lusting after glamorous investments can damage your finances at least as much as hankering after a sexual partner, car, or house that you cannot afford. The rich would be far better off investing with the hoi polloi in plain-vanilla, low-cost index funds. The reason that “guru” is such a popular word is because “charlatan” is so hard to spell. In recent years, the darlings of the story-telling crowd have been commodities funds and BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) country stocks, with disastrous results for those who read and listened to their claptrap. If you do feel compelled to seek excitement in finance - and I do not recommend it - hive off a small portion of your portfolio with which to amuse yourself. Segregate this account, which should be no larger than 10 percent of your nest egg, from the rest of your portfolio, and never add to it. When it is gone, it is gone, and hopefully with it the thrill of stock picking. Most grizzled veterans will tell you that the best purchases are often made when they feel they are about to throw up. Unglamorous, slowly growing countries are often great markets; avoid making the classic mistake of conflating a rapidly growing economy with high equity returns. Dare to be dull. The prudent investor treats almost the entirety of the financial industrial landscape as an urban combat zone. This means any stock broker or full-service brokerage firm, any newsletter, any advisor who purchases individual securities, any hedge fund. Most mutual fund companies spew more toxic waste into the investment environment than a third-world refinery. Most financial advisors cannot invest their way out a paper bag. Who can you trust? Almost no one. Most seek employment at brokerage houses, hedge funds, and mutual funds for the same reason Willie Sutton supposedly offered for robbing banks: “Because that’s where the money is.” Consequently, you should extend an extra degree of caution to anyone who wants to manage your finances. The message of the preceding pages could not be clearer: Do not come anywhere near a stock broker or a brokerage firm. Fund companies publish their fees and expenses in fund prospectuses and regular reports. They do not publish their transactional costs, but these can be estimated by looking at the level of turnover, the size of the fund, and the size of the companies they own, all of which are available. Since stock mutual funds lose about 0.1 percent of return for every 10 percent of turnover, the lower the turnover, the better. The ownership structure of any financial services company ultimately determines just how well it serves its shareholders in the long run. Do not invest with any mutual fund family that is owned by a publicly traded parent company. Fidelity offers very low-priced, passively managed funds. They are so low-priced, in fact, that they serve as loss leaders, designed to get you into the store to buy its more expensive funds. As long as you keep to the discount rack, you should do well there. Barclays, whose iShares series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the leaders in this field. I am not wild about ETFs, but they do offer small investors indexed products in more esoteric asset classes that are not covered by Vanguard and Fidelity. As this is being written, unfortunately, iShares has just been purchased by BlackRock, thus clouding its future. A 25-year-old should be saving at least 10 percent of his or her salary, this means that a 45-year-old will need to save nearly half of his or her salary. The commission and spread costs incurred by ETFs will quickly erode their minuscule expense advantage. I do not trust most of the ETF providers to support these products over the very long term; all except Vanguard are publicly traded entities. There are a few instances in which an ETF does make sense. The first is the iShares EAFE (international) value ETF, for which Vanguard offers no corresponding index/passive mutual fund. The second is the Vanguard All-World ex-U.S. Small-Cap ETF, which does not charge the 0.75 percent purchase fee levied on the investor-class shares and also carries a much lower expense ratio (0.38 versus 0.60 percent). The third would be the iShares international REIT fund (IFGL), for which there is no equivalent open-end fund available to most small investors. I normally recommend a healthy dollop of short-term Treasury notes in place of cash, but Treasury yields are currently so low that it is better to put the funds in a money market account until short-term Treasury yields rise above 3 to 4 percent. How does Taxable Ted deploy the proceeds of the sale of his company, which are currently in cash? This can be done in at least two different ways. The first would be a simple lump sum deployment, in which he purchases all of his stock and bond positions at once. At current stock valuations, this might be a reasonable thing to do. Alternatively, Ted might set up a value averaging path for the risky stock assets in his proposed portfolio over the next several years. A compromise between the two techniques would be to invest the first half of his stock allocation right away, then value average the rest. The excess returns generated by rebalancing are not large, usually no greater than 1 percent per year, which is much smaller than the capital gains taxes you will realize on most sales. So purely from a returns point of view, you should never sell stocks to rebalance inside a taxable portfolio. Buying is fine, of course, and you can also use fund distributions - the capital gains, dividends, and interest the funds throw off - to rebalance as well. At some point, however, some selling is advisable to control risk. If you start with a 50/50 portfolio and a prolonged bull market takes your portfolio to 65/35, or even 75/25, then something needs to be done. How often should you rebalance? The answer is relatively infrequently. Rebalance your portfolio approximately once every few years; more than once per year is probably too often. In taxable portfolios, do so even less frequently. One more advantage of an indexed/passive approach to investing. When an index fund does terribly, it is because that asset class has done terribly, which usually means that it has gotten cheaper. In turn, this usually means that its expected future returns have gone up, and that the investor can buy some more of the fund with a reasonably clean conscience. On the other hand, when an actively managed fund does terribly, the possibility that the poor performance is due to the manager’s lack of skill gnaws at your self-confidence: Should you really be buying more of a fund run by a possibly incompetent manager? Did you make the wrong choice in the first place? Quite often, such poor performance is due to some combination of bad luck and poor asset-class performance. This may lead to the wrong decision: firing the fund manager just as his or her asset class is about to turn around or his or her luck is about to change. In short, indexing your investments means never having to say you’re sorry. Rebalancing can lose as well as gain return. Is there any reason to believe that, on average, rebalancing will help more than hurt? Not if we believe that market movements are random. After all, we rebalance with the hope that an asset with past higher/lower than average returns will have future lower/ higher than average returns. Is this actually true? Probably. Recall that over short periods of time asset classes demonstrate momentum, but that over periods longer than a year, they tend to mean-revert. I recommend that beginners stick to rebalancing by the calendar once every few years or so. If at some point you do decide to switch to the threshold technique, you will need to develop individual rebalancing parameters that are not only asset-class specific, but also portfolio-specific as well. Threshold rebalancing for most practitioners tends to be a work in progress. Rebalancing a given asset class too often or too infrequently is usually a signal to adjust the threshold up or down, respectively.

How We Decide,Jonah Lehrer,0618620117,8,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is responsible for integrating visceral emotions into the decision-making process. It connects the feelings generated by the ""primitive"" brain-areas like the brain stem and the amygdala, which is in the limbic system-to the stream of conscious thought. When a person is drawn to something, the mind is trying to tell him that he should choose that option. It has already assessed the alternatives - this analysis takes place outside of conscious awareness - and converted that assessment into a positive emotion. And when he sees an option he doesn't like, it is the OFC that makes him want to get away. The world is full of things, and it is our feelings that help us choose among them. Emotion and motivation share the same Latin root, movere, which means ""to move."" Feelings are often an accurate shortcut, a concise expression of decades' worth of experience. They already know how to do it. The human brain is like a computer operating system that was rushed to market. This is why a cheap calculator can do arithmetic better than a professional mathematician, why a mainframe computer can beat a grand master at chess, and why we so often confuse causation and correlation. When it comes to the new parts of the brain, evolution just hasn't had time to work out the kinks. The emotional brain, however, has been exquisitely refined by evolution over the last several hundred million years. Its software code has been subjected to endless tests, so it can make fast decisions based on very little information. The process of thinking requires feeling, for feelings are what let us understand all the information that we can't directly comprehend. Reason without emotion is impotent. After the ACC receives input from a dopamine neuron, spindle cells use their cellular velocity - they transmit electrical signals faster than any other neuron - to make sure that the rest of the cortex is instantly saturated in that specific feeling. Human emotions are rooted in the predictions of highly flexible brain cells, which are constantly adjusting their connections to reflect reality. Every time you make a mistake or encounter something new, your brain cells are busy changing themselves. Our emotions are deeply empirical. Dopamine neurons automatically detect the subtle patterns that we would otherwise fail to notice; they assimilate all the data that we can't consciously comprehend. And then, once they come up with a set of refined predictions about how the world works, they translate these predictions into emotions. These wise yet inexplicable feelings are an essential part of the decision-making process. Even when we think we know nothing, our brains know something. That's what our feelings are trying to tell us. This doesn't mean that people can coast on these cellular emotions. Dopamine neurons need to be continually trained and retrained, or else their predictive accuracy declines. Trusting one's emotions requires constant vigilance; intelligent intuition is the result of deliberate practice. For Bill Robertie, his success has a simple explanation: ""I know how to practice. I know how to make myself better."" Robertie bought a book on backgammon strategy, memorized a few opening moves, and then started to play. And play. And play. ""You've got to get obsessed. You've got to reach the point where you're having dreams about the game. I could just glance at a board and know what I should do. The game started to become very much a matter of aesthetics. My decisions increasingly depended on the look of things, so that I could contemplate a move and then see right away if it made my position look better or worse."" It's not the quantity of practice, it's the quality. The most effective way to get better is to focus on your mistakes. In other words, you need to consciously consider the errors being internalized. Searching for his errors, dissecting those decisions that could have been a little bit better. He knows that self-criticism is the secret to self-improvement; negative feedback is the best kind. An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that can be made in a very narrow field. The experience of failure had been so discouraging for the ""smart"" kids that they actually regressed. The problem with praising kids for their innate intelligence - the ""smart"" compliment - is that it misrepresents the neural reality of education. It encourages kids to avoid the most useful kind of learning activities, which is learning from mistakes. Unless you experience the unpleasant symptoms of being wrong, your brain will never revise its models. After Herb Stein finishes shooting a soap opera episode, he immediately goes home and reviews the rough cut. ""I watch the whole thing, and I just take notes. I'm looking really hard for my mistakes. I pretty much always want to find thirty mistakes, thirty things that I could have done better. If I can't find thirty, then I'm not looking hard enough."" But emotions aren't perfect. They are a crucial cognitive tool, but even the most useful tools can't solve every problem. In fact, there are certain conditions that consistently short-circuit the emotional brain, causing people to make bad decisions. The best decision-makers know which situations require less intuitive responses. Scientists found there was absolutely no evidence of the hot hand. A player's chance of making a shot was not affected by whether or not his previous shots had gone in. Each field-goal attempt was its own independent event. The stock market is a classic example of a random system. The past movement of any particular stock cannot be used to predict its future movement. Fama looked at decades of stock-market data in order to prove that no amount of knowledge or rational analysis could help anyone figure out what would happen next. All of the esoteric tools used by investors to make sense of the market were pure nonsense. Wall Street was like a slot machine.The danger of the stock market, however, is that sometimes its erratic fluctuations can actually look predictable, at least in the short term. Our brains completely misinterpret what's actually going on. We trust our feelings and perceive patterns, but the patterns don't actually exist. These computational signals are also a main cause of financial bubbles. When the market keeps going up, people are led to make larger and larger investments in the boom. Their greedy brains are convinced that they've solved the stock market, and so they don't think about the possibility of losses. You get the exact opposite effect when the market heads down. People just can't wait to get out, because the brain doesn't want to regret staying in. At this point, the brain realizes that it's made some very expensive prediction errors, and the investor races to dump any assets that are declining in value. It's silly to try to beat the market with your brain. Since the market is a random walk with an upward slope, the best solution is to pick a low-cost index fund and wait. Patiently. Don't fixate on what might have been or obsess over someone else's profits. The investor who does nothing to his stock portfolio - who doesn't buy or sell a single stock - outperforms the average ""active"" investor by nearly 10 percent. Wall Street has always searched for the secret algorithm of financial success, but the secret is, there is no secret. Over the long term, stock portfolios always generated higher returns than bond portfolios. In fact, stocks typically earned more than seven times as much as bonds. MaCurdy and Shoven concluded that people who invest in bonds must be ""confused about the relative safety of different investments over long horizons."" The key to solving the premium equity puzzle was loss aversion. Investors buy bonds because they hate losing money, and bonds are a safe bet. Instead of making financial decisions that reflect all the relevant statistical information, they depend on their emotional instincts and seek the certain safety of bonds. Loss aversion also explains one of the most common investing mistakes: investors evaluating their stock portfolios are most likely to sell stocks that have increased in value. Unfortunately, this means that they end up holding on to their depreciating stocks. Over the long term, this strategy is exceedingly foolish. Even professional money managers are vulnerable to this bias and tend to hold losing stocks twice as long as winning stocks. Why does an investor do this? Because he is afraid to take a loss - it feels bad - and selling shares that have decreased in value makes the loss tangible. We try to postpone the pain for as long as possible; the result is more losses. Loss aversion is an innate flaw. Everyone who experiences emotion is vulnerable to its effects. It's part of a larger psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias, which means that, for the human mind, bad is stronger than good. Asymmetric paternalism. That's a fancy name for a simple idea: creating policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational impulses and make better, more prudent decisions. People who are more rational don't perceive emotion less, they just regulate it better. How do we regulate our emotions? The answer is surprisingly simple: by thinking about them. As soon as people have the insight, they say it just seems obviously correct. They know instantly that they've solved the problem. When you encounter a problem you've never experienced before, when your dopamine neurons have no idea what to do, it's essential that you try to tune out your feelings. Pilots call such a state ""deliberate calm,"" because staying calm in high-pressure situations requires conscious effort. Performance choking is actually triggered by a specific mental mistake: thinking too much. Novice putters hit better shots when they consciously reflect on their actions. The more time the beginner spends thinking about the putt, the more likely he is to sink the ball in the hole. By concentrating on the golf game, by paying attention to the mechanics of the stroke, the novice can avoid beginners' mistakes. A little experience, however, changes everything. After a golfer has learned how to putt - once he or she has memorized the necessary movements - analyzing the stroke is a waste of time. The brain already knows what to do. (After black students did worse on IQ tests:) When Steele gave a separate group of students the same test but stressed that it was not a measure of intelligence - he told them it was merely a preparatory drill - the scores of the white and black students were virtually identical. The achievement gap had been closed. When the rational brain hijacks the mind, people tend to make all sorts of decision-making mistakes. They hit bad golf shots and choose wrong answers on standardized tests. They ignore the wisdom of their emotions - the knowledge embedded in their dopamine neurons - and start reaching for things that they can explain. One of the problems with feelings is that even when they are accurate, they can still be hard to articulate. Instead of going with the option that feels the best, a person starts going with the option that sounds the best, even if it's a very bad idea. He asked them to explain why they preferred one brand over another. As they tasted the jams, the students filled out written questionnaires, which forced them to analyze their first impressions, to consciously explain their impulsive preferences. All this extra analysis seriously warped their jam judgment. The students now preferred the worst-tasting jam, according to Consumer Reports. Thinking too much about strawberry jam causes us to focus on all sorts of variables that don't actually matter. Instead of just listening to our instinctive preferences - the best jam is associated with the most positive feelings - our rational brains search for reasons to prefer one jam over another. There is such a thing as too much analysis. When you overthink at the wrong moment, you cut yourself off from the wisdom of your emotions, which are much better at assessing actual preferences. You lose the ability to know what you really want. The more people thought about which posters they wanted, the more misleading their thoughts became. Self-analysis resulted in less self-awareness. Deliberative homeowners focused on less important details like square footage and number of bathrooms. It's easier to consider quantifiable facts than future emotions, such as how you'll feel when you're stuck in a rush-hour traffic jam. The prospective homeowners assumed a bigger house in the suburbs would make them happy, even if it meant spending an extra hour in the car every day. The placebo effect depended entirely on the prefrontal cortex, the center of reflective, deliberate thought. When people were told that they'd just received pain-relieving cream, their frontal lobes responded by inhibiting the activity of their emotional brain areas (like the insula) that normally respond to pain. Because people expected to experience less pain, they ended up experiencing less pain. People who'd paid discounted prices for ""brain power"" drinks consistently solved about 30 percent fewer puzzles than the people who'd paid full price for the drinks. The subjects were convinced that the stuff on sale was much less potent, even though all the drinks were identical. The effort required to memorize seven digits drew cognitive resources away from the part of the brain that normally controls emotional urges. A slight drop in blood-sugar levels can also inhibit self-control, since the frontal lobes require lots of energy in order to function. Students who were given the drink without real sugar were significantly more likely to rely on instinct and intuition when choosing a place to live, even if that led them to choose the wrong places. The reason, according to Baumeister, is that the rational brains of these students were simply too exhausted to think. They'd needed a restorative sugar fix, and all they'd gotten was Splenda. This research can also help explain why we get cranky when we're hungry and tired: the brain is less able to suppress the negative emotions sparked by small annoyances. Each of the students select a portfolio of stock investments. Then he divided the students into two groups. The first group could see only the changes in the prices of their stocks. They had no idea why the share prices rose or fell and had to make their trading decisions based on an extremely limited amount of data. In contrast, the second group was given access to a steady stream of financial information. They could watch CNBC, read the Wall Street journal, and consult experts for the latest analysis of market trends. So which group did better? To Andreassen's surprise, the group with less information ended up earning more than twice as much as the well-informed group. Being exposed to extra news was distracting, and the high-information students quickly became focused on the latest rumors and insider gossip. (Herbert Simon said it best: ""A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention."") As a result of all the extra input, these students engaged in far more buying and selling than the low-information group. They were convinced that all their knowledge allowed them to anticipate the market. But they were wrong. People almost always assume that more information is better. Modern corporations are especially beholden to this idea and spend a fortune trying to create ""analytic workspaces"" that ""maximize the informational potential of their decision-makers."" These managerial cliches, plucked from the sales brochures of companies such as Oracle and Unisys, are predicated on the assumptions that executives perform better when they have access to more facts and figures and that bad decisions are a result of ignorance. But it's important to know the limitations of this approach, which are rooted in the limitations of the brain. When a person gives their brain too many facts and then tries to make a decision based on the facts that seem important, that person is asking for trouble. He is going to buy the wrong items at Wal-Mart and pick the wrong stocks. A group of researchers imaged the spinal regions of 98 people who had no back pain or back-related problems. The pictures were then sent to doctors who didn't know that the patients weren't in pain. The result was shocking: the doctors reported that two-thirds of these normal patients exhibited ""serious problems"" such as bulging, protruding, or herniated discs. In 38 percent of these patients, the MRI revealed multiple damaged discs. Nearly 90 percent of these patients exhibited some form of ""disc degeneration."" These structural abnormalities are often used to justify surgery. This is the danger of too much information: it can actually interfere with understanding. When the prefrontal cortex is overwhelmed, a person can no longer make sense of the situation. Correlation is confused with causation, and people make theories out of coincidences. When you see a painting, you usually know instantly and automatically whether you like it. If someone asks you to explain your judgment, you confabulate. Moral arguments are much the same: Two people feel strongly about an issue, their feelings come first, and their reasons are invented on the fly, to throw at each other. When you are confronted with an ethical dilemma, the unconscious automatically generates an emotional reaction. (This is what psychopaths can't do.) Within a few milliseconds, the brain has made up its mind; you know what is right and what is wrong. These moral instincts aren't rational - they've never heard of Kant - but they are an essential part of what keep us all from committing unspeakable crimes. It's only at this point - after the emotions have already made the moral decision - that those rational circuits in the prefrontal cortex are activated. People come up with persuasive reasons to justify their moral intuition. When it comes to making ethical decisions, human rationality isn't a scientist, it's a lawyer. Benjamin Franklin: ""So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do."" ""Moral dumbfounding:"" People know something seems morally wrong - (sibling sex example) - but no one can rationally defend the verdict. The ultimatum game, a staple of experimental economics. The rules of the game are simple, if a little bit unfair: an experimenter pairs two people together, and hands one of them ten dollars. This person (the proposer) gets to decide how the ten dollars is divided. The second person (the responder) can either accept the offer, which allows both players to pocket their respective shares, or reject the offer, in which case both players walk away empty-handed. When the dictator cannot see the responder - the two players are located in separate rooms - the dictator lapses into unfettered greed. Instead of giving away a significant share of the profits, the despots start offering mere pennies and pocketing the rest. Once people become socially isolated, they stop simulating the feelings of other people. People who showed more brain activity in their sympathetic regions were also much more likely to exhibit altruistic behavior. Because they intensely imagined the feelings of other people, they wanted to make other people feel better, even if it came at personal expense. But here's the lovely secret of altruism: it feels good. The brain is designed so that acts of charity are pleasurable; being nice to others makes us feel nice. Aut is Greek for ""self,"" and autism translates to ""the state of being unto one's self."" When people were shown a picture of a starving Malawian child, they acted with impressive generosity. They donated an average of $2.50. When other people were provided with a list of statistics about starvation throughout Africa - more than three million children in Malawi are malnourished, more than eleven million people in Ethiopia need immediate food assistance, and so forth - the average donation was 50% lower. The depressing numbers leave us cold: our minds can't comprehend suffering on such a massive scale. This is why we are riveted when one child falls down a well but turn a blind eye to the millions of people who die every year for lack of clean water. And why we donate thousands of dollars to help a single African war orphan featured on the cover of a magazine but ignore widespread genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. As Mother Teresa put it, ""If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at the one, I will."" A brain that's intolerant of uncertainty - that can't stand the argument - often tricks itself into thinking the wrong thing. Why are pundits (especially the prominent ones) so bad at forecasting the future? The sin of certainty, which led the ""experts"" to mistakenly impose a top-down solution on their decision-making processes. One of the best ways to distinguish genuine from phony expertise is to look at how a person responds to dissonant data. Does he or she reject the data out of hand? Perform elaborate mental gymnastics to avoid admitting error? Use your conscious mind to acquire all the information you need for making a decision. But don't try to analyze the information with your conscious mind. Instead, go on holiday while your unconscious mind digests it. Whatever your intuition then tells you is almost certainly going to be the best choice. The easy problems - the mundane math problems of daily life - that are best suited to the conscious brain. These simple decisions won't overwhelm the prefrontal cortex. In fact, they are so simple that they tend to trip up the emotions. If the decision can be accurately summarized in numerical terms: let the rational brain take over. For important decisions about complex items, think less about those items that you care a lot about. Don't be afraid to let your emotions choose. Simple problems require reason. Novel problems also require reason. Before you entrust a mystery to the emotional brain, before deciding to let your instincts make a big bet in poker or fire a missile at a suspicious radar blip, ask yourself a question: How does your past experience help solve this particular problem? If the problem really is unprecedented - if it's like a complete hydraulic failure in a Boeing 737 - then emotions can't save you. Whenever possible, it's essential to extend the decision-making process and properly consider the argument unfolding inside your head. Bad decisions happen when that mental debate is cut short, when an artificial consensus is imposed on the neural quarrel. There are two simple tricks to help ensure that you never let certainty interfere with your judgment: #1 : Always entertain competing hypotheses. When you force yourself to interpret the facts through a different, perhaps uncomfortable lens, you often discover that your beliefs rest on a rather shaky foundation. For instance, when Michael Binger is convinced that another player is bluffing, he tries to think about how the player would be acting if he wasn't bluffing. He is his own devil's advocate. #2 : Continually remind yourself of what you don't know. Even the best models and theories can be undone by utterly unpredictable events. Powell: ""Tell me what you know. Then tell me what you don't know, and only then can you tell me what you think. Always keep those three separated."" The reason these emotions are so intelligent is that they've managed to turn mistakes into educational events. You are constantly benefiting from experience, even if you're not consciously aware of the benefits. The brain always learns the same way, accumulating wisdom through error. There are no shortcuts to this painstaking process; becoming an expert just takes time and practice. But once you've developed expertise in a particular area - once you've made the requisite mistakes - it's important to trust your emotions when making decisions in that domain. It is feelings, after all, and not the prefrontal cortex, that capture the wisdom of experience. This doesn't mean the emotional brain should always be trusted. Sometimes it can be impulsive and short-sighted. Sometimes it can be a little too sensitive to patterns. However, the one thing you should always be doing is considering your emotions, thinking about why you're feeling what you're feeling. Even when you choose to ignore your emotions, they are still a valuable source of input. If you're going to take only one idea away from this book, take this one: Whenever you make a decision, be aware of the kind of decision you are making and the kind of thought process it requires. The best way to make sure that you are using your brain properly is to study your brain at work, to listen to the argument inside your head. You can't avoid loss aversion unless you know that the mind treats losses differently than gains. And you'll probably think too much about buying a house unless you know that such a strategy will lead you to buy the wrong property. The mind is full of flaws, but they can be outsmarted. The best decision-makers don't despair. Instead, they become students of error, determined to learn from what went wrong. They think about what they could have done differently so that the next time their neurons will know what to do. Classroom flight school: The problem with this approach, is that everything was abstract. The pilot has this body of knowledge, but they'd never applied it before. The benefit of a flight simulator is that it allows pilots to internalize their new knowledge. Instead of memorizing lessons, a pilot can train the emotional brain, preparing the parts of the cortex that will actually make the decision. The goal is to learn from those mistakes when they don't count, so that when it really matters, you can make the right decision. This approach targets the dopamine system, which improves itself by studying its errors. As a result, pilots develop accurate sets of flight instincts. Their brains have been prepared in advance. The ideal atmosphere for good decision-making: where a diversity of opinions are openly shared. The evidence is looked at from multiple angles, and new alternatives are considered. -- Amanda Cook, my editor at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, was a godsend. She took a messy, convoluted, unstructured manuscript and managed to find the thread that brought it all together. She suggested stories, fixed my prose, and talked me through my confusion. She is the kind of editor - thoughtful, whip-smart, and generous - that every writer dreams about.","Brilliant book with one clear message: our emotional brain is faster and usually smarter than our logical brain. Our emotions are trained by years of logic and experience, retaining it all for real wisdom. Many decisions are better made by going with the gut feeling. Gets a little too technical with deep brain/neuro/cortex talk, but brings it back to usable points."
The Talent Code,Daniel Coyle,055380684X,8,"""You will become clever through your mistakes."" - German proverb ""Excepting fools, men do not differ much in intellect, only in zeal and hard work."" - Charles Darwin ""A teacher affects eternity. He can nevertell where his influence stops."" - Henry Brooks Adams Skill is a cellular insulation that wraps neural circuits and that grows in response to certain signals. The more time and energy you put into the right kind of practice - the longer you stay in the deep-learning zone, firing the right signals through your circuits - the more skill you get. [TWO LISTS OF WORDS: Column A, words are complete. Column B, they are missing an obvious letter, but super-easy to figure out.] You will remember three times as many more of the words in column B, the ones that contained fragments. It's as if, in those few seconds, your memory skills suddenly sharpened. When you encountered the words with blank spaces, something both imperceptible and profound happened. You stopped. You stumbled ever so briefly, then figured it out. You experienced a microsecond of struggle, and that microsecond made all the difference. You didn't practice harder when you looked at column B. You practiced deeper. Deep practice is built on a paradox: struggling in certain targeted ways - operating at the edges of your ability, where you make mistakes - makes you smarter. Experiences where you're forced to slow down, make errors, and correct them. Group A studied the paper for four sessions. Group B studied only once but was tested three times. A week later both groups were tested, and Group B scored 50 percent higher than Group A. They'd studied one-fourth as much yet learned far more. Capture failure and turn it into skill. The trick is to choose a goal just beyond your present abilities. [The flight simulator] permitted pilots to practice more deeply, to stop, struggle, make errors, and learn from them. During a few hours in a flight simulator, a pilot could take off and land a dozen times on instruments. He could dive, stall, and recover, spending hours inhabiting the sweet spot at the edge of his capabilities in ways he could never risk in an actual plane. Brazilian soccer is different from the rest of the world's because Brazil employs the sporting equivalent of a flight simulator. Futsal compresses soccer's essential skills into a small box; it places players inside the deep practice zone, making and correcting errors, constantly generating solutions to vivid problems. We'll define talent in its strictest sense: the possession of repeatable skills that don't depend on physical size. The more we fire a particular circuit, the more myelin optimizes that circuit, and the stronger, faster, and more fluent our movements and thoughts become. The best way to build a good circuit is to fire it, attend to mistakes, then fire it again, over and over. This requires immense energy and time. If you don't love it, you'll never work hard enough to be great. The more we develop a skill circuit, the less we're aware that we're using it. We're built to make skills automatic, to stash them in our unconscious mind. This process is called automaticity. The more the nerve fires, the more myelin wraps around it. The more myelin wraps around it, the faster the signals travel, increasing velocities up to one hundred times over signals sent through an uninsulated fiber. Struggle is not optional - it's neurologically required! In order to get your skill circuit to fire optimally, you must by definition fire the circuit suboptimally. You must make mistakes and pay attention to those mistakes. You must slowly teach your circuit. You must also keep firing that circuit - i.e., practicing - in order to keep myelin functioning properly. Deep practice is assisted by the attainment of a primal state, one where we are attentive, hungry, and focused, even desperate. How the human cardiovascular system actually works: that we can improve it by targeting our aerobic or anaerobic systems, that we can strengthen our heart and muscles by pushing ourselves to operate at the outer edges of our ability - lifting a slightly heavier weight, or trying to run a slightly farther distance. Expertise is the result of around ten thousand hours of committed practice. Ericsson called this process “deliberate practice” and defined it as - working on technique - seeking constant critical feedback - focusing ruthlessly on shoring up weaknesses. Some have an innate, obsessive desire to improve - what psychologist Ellen Winner calls “the rage to master.” But these sorts of self-driven deep practicers are rare and are blazingly self-evident. The great Renaissance artists had one thing in common: they all spent thousands of hours inside a deep-practice hothouse, firing and optimizing circuits, correcting errors, competing, and improving skills. Breast-fed babies have higher IQs because the fatty acids in breast milk are the building blocks of myelin. This is why the FDA recently approved the addition of omega-3 fatty acids to infant formula, and also why eating fish, which is rich in fatty acids, has been linked to lowered risk of memory loss, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. (Bartzokis takes DHA fatty acids daily.) Thinking that talent comes from genes and environment is like thinking that cookies come from sugar, flour, and butter. Whatever circuits are fired most, and most urgently, are the ones where the installers will go. Skill circuits that are fired often will receive more broadband. Skills that are fired less often, with less urgency, will receive less broadband. Chess masters are not seeing individual chess pieces but recognizing patterns. Where novices see a scattered alphabet of individual pieces, masters group those “letters” into the chess equivalent of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Skill consists of identifying important elements and grouping them into a meaningful framework: chunking. In the talent hotbeds I visited, the chunking takes place in three dimensions. 1. they look at the task as a whole - as one big chunk, the megacircuit. 2. they divide it into its smallest possible chunks. 3. they play with time, slowing the action down, then speeding it up, to learn its inner architecture. Absorb a picture of the skill until you can imagine yourself doing it. Meadowmount music school founder: Ivan Galamian. In seven weeks, most students will learn a year's worth of material, an increase of about 500 percent in learning speed. Teachers take the idea of chunking to its extreme: Students scissor each measure of their sheet music into horizontal strips, which are stuffed into envelopes and pulled out in random order. They go on to break those strips into smaller fragments by altering rhythms. If a passerby can recognize the song being played, it's not being practiced correctly. Is it possible to judge ability solely by the way people describe the way they practice? Researchers Zimmerman and Kitsantas gathered volleyball players, and asked them how they approached the serve: their goals, planning, strategy choices, self-monitoring, and adaptation - twelve measures in all. Using the answers, they predicted the players' relative skill levels, then had the players execute their serve to test the accuracy of their predictions. Ninety percent of the variation in skill could be accounted for by the players' answers. Experts practice differently and far more strategically. When they fail, they don't blame it on luck or themselves. They have a strategy they can fix. Causing skill to evaporate: just stop a skilled person from systematically firing his or her circuit for a mere thirty days. There seems to be a universal limit for how much deep practice human beings can do in a day. Ericsson's research shows that most world-class experts - including pianists, chess players, novelists, and athletes - practice between three and five hours a day, no matter what skill they pursue. A course called “How to Practice,” taught by Skye Carman. The point is to get a balance point where you can sense the errors when they come. To avoid the mistakes, first you have to feel them immediately. the sweet spot: that productive, uncomfortable terrain located just beyond our current abilities, where our reach exceeds our grasp. Deep practice is not simply about struggling; it's about seeking out a particular struggle, which involves a cycle of distinct actions. Pick a target. Reach for it. Evaluate the gap between the target and the reach. Return to step one. To get good, it's helpful to be willing, or even enthusiastic, about being bad. Other hotbeds follow the same pattern: a breakthrough success is followed by a massive bloom of talent. After Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile, 17 others did, too. The 17 runners had received a clear signal - you can do this too. The moments that lead us to say, “That is who I want to be.” Tests compared new musicians who saw themselves as in it for the long term, versus just trying it. With the same amount of practice, the long-term-commitment group outperformed the short-term-commitment group by 400 percent. The long-term-commitment group, with a mere twenty minutes of weekly practice, progressed faster than the short-termers who practiced for an hour and a half. When long-term commitment combined with high levels of practice, skills skyrocketed. It's all about their perception of self. At some point very early on they had a crystallizing experience that brings the idea to the fore, that says, I am a musician. That idea is like a snowball rolling downhill. A vision of their ideal future selves, a vision that oriented, energized, and accelerated progress, and that originated in the outside world. Being highly motivated, when you think about it, is a slightly irrational state. One forgoes comfort now in order to work toward some bigger prospective benefit later on. It's not as simple as saying I want X. It's saying something far more complicated: I want X later, so I better do Y like crazy right now. We speak of motivation as if it's a rational assessment of cause and effect, but in fact it's closer to a bet. If we're in a nice, easy, pleasant environment, we naturally shut off effort. Why work? But if people get the signal that it's rough, they get motivated now. A nice, well-kept tennis academy gives them the luxury future right now! Of course they'd be demotivated. They can't help it. Ignition is determined by simple if/then propositions, with the then part always the same: “better get busy”. See someone you want to become? Better get busy. Want to catch up with a desirable group? Better get busy. Losing a parent is a primal cue: you are not safe. You don't have to be a psychologist to appreciate the massive outpouring of energy that can be created by a lack of safety. Curaçao grew talent because the message of Jones's success was translated and amplified into a reliable combination of primal cues. Frank Curiel Field, after all, only looks like a beat-up baseball diamond. It is in fact a million-watt antenna steadily transmitting a powerful stream of signals and images that add up to a thrilling whisper: Hey, that could be you. Half of the kids were praised for their intelligence (“You must be smart at this”), and half were praised for their effort (“You must have worked really hard”). The praised-for-effort group improved their initial score by 30 percent, while the praised-for-intelligence group's score declined by 20 percent. All because of six short words. The teachers and coaches I met were quiet, even reserved. They were mostly older; many had been teaching thirty or forty years. They possessed the same sort of gaze: steady, deep, unblinking. They listened far more than they talked. They seemed allergic to giving pep talks or inspiring speeches; they spent most of their time offering small, targeted, highly specific adjustments. They had an extraordinary sensitivity to the person they were teaching, customizing each message to each student's personality. Sang needed more emotion, so Jensen turned into a hepped-up cheerleader; Delphos needed a learning strategy, so Jensen turned into a Zen master. He didn't only tell them what to do: he became what they should do, communicating the goal with gesture, tone, rhythm, and gaze. The signals were targeted, concise, unmissable, and accurate. Coach Wooden's observers noted 2,326 discrete acts of teaching. Of them, a mere 6.9 percent were compliments. Only 6.6 percent were expressions of displeasure. But 75 percent were pure information: what to do, how to do it, when to intensify an activity. One of Wooden's most frequent forms of teaching was a three-part instruction where he modeled the right way to do something, showed the incorrect way, and then remodeled the right way. Laws of learning: explanation demonstration imitation correction repetition. “Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That's the only way it happens - and when it happens, it lasts,” he wrote in The Wisdom of Wooden. “The importance of repetition until automaticity cannot be overstated,” he said in You Haven't Taught Until They Have Learned. Good coaches help the right circuit to fire as often as possible. Baby-brain DVDs don't work because they don't create deep practice - in fact, they actively prevent it, by taking up time that could be used for firing circuits. The Shyness Clinic: Founder Philip Zimbardo. “We believe that people are shy not because they lack social skills but because they haven't practiced them sufficiently. Talking on the phone or asking someone on a date is a learnable skill, exactly like a tennis forehand. The key is that people have to linger in that uncomfortable area, learn to tolerate the anxiety. If you practice, you can get to the level you want.” “Neurosis is just a high-class word for whining,” he said. “The trouble with most therapy is that it helps you to feel better. But you don't get better. You have to back it up with action, action, action.”","A great book showing that deep practice - (struggling in certain targeted ways - operating at the edges of your ability, where you make mistakes - experiences where you're forced to slow down, make errors, and correct them) - is what really makes you improve at anything."
Ignore Everybody,Hugh MacLeod,159184259X,8,"Good ideas alter the power balance in relationships. that is why good ideas are always initially resisted. Good ideas come with a heavy burden, which is why so few people execute them. So few people can handle it. 1. Ignore everybody. 2. The idea doesn’t have to be big. It just has to be yours. The sovereignty you have over your work will inspire far more people than the actual content ever will. Your idea doesn’t have to be big. It just has to be yours alone. The more the idea is yours alone, the more freedom you have to do something really amazing. 3. Put the hours in. If somebody in your industry is more successful than you, it’s probably because he works harder at it than you do. 4. Good ideas have lonely childhoods. 5. If your business plan depends on suddenly being “discovered” by some big shot, your plan will probably fail. 6. You are responsible for your own experience. 7. Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten. 8. Keep your day job. The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task at hand covers both bases, but not often. It’s balancing the need to make a good living while still maintaining one’s creative sovereignty. The young writer who has to wait tables to pay the bills, in spite of her writing appearing in all the cool and hip magazines... who dreams of one day not having her life divided so harshly. Well, over time the “harshly” bit might go away, but not the “divided.” This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended. And nobody is immune. Not the struggling waiter, nor the movie star. As soon as you accept this, I mean really accept this, for some reason your career starts moving ahead faster. 9. Companies that squelch creativity can no longer compete with companies that champion creativity. 10. Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb. You may never reach the summit; for that you will be forgiven. But if you don’t make at least one serious attempt to get above the snow line, years later you will find yourself lying on your deathbed, and all you will feel is emptiness. 11. The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props. Meeting a person who wrote a masterpiece on the back of a deli menu would not surprise me. Meeting a person who wrote a masterpiece with a silver Cartier fountain pen on an antique writing table in an airy SoHo loft would seriously surprise me. A fancy tool just gives the second-rater one more pillar to hide behind. Which is why there are so many second-rate art directors with state-of-the-art Macintosh computers. Successful people, artists and nonartists alike, are very good at spotting pillars. They’re very good at doing without them. Even more important, once they’ve spotted a pillar, they’re very good at quickly getting rid of it. Good pillar management is one of the most valuable talents you can have on the planet. Keep asking the question, “Is this a pillar?” about every aspect of our business, our craft, our reason for being alive, and go from there. The more we ask, the better we get at spotting pillars, the more quickly the pillars vanish. 12. Don’t try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether. 13. If you accept the pain, it cannot hurt you. You’re better off doing something on the assumption that you will not be rewarded for it, that it will not receive the recognition it deserves, that it will not be worth the time and effort invested in it. The obvious advantage to this angle is, of course, if anything good comes of it, then it’s an added bonus. The second, more subtle and profound advantage is that by scuppering all hope of worldly and social betterment from the creative act, you are finally left with only one question to answer: Do you make this damn thing exist or not? 14. Never compare your inside with somebody else’s outside. The more you practice your craft, the less you confuse worldly rewards with spiritual rewards, and vice versa. Never sell something you love. Otherwise, you may as well be selling your children. 15. Dying young is overrated. Every kid underestimates his competition, and overestimates his chances. Every kid is a sucker for the idea that there’s a way to make it without having to do the actual hard work. The bars of West Hollywood, London, and New York are awash with people throwing their lives away in the desperate hope of finding a shortcut, any shortcut. Meanwhile the competition is at home, working their asses off. 16. The most important thing a creative person can learn professionally is where to draw the red line that separates what you are willing to do from what you are not. It is this red line that demarcates your sovereignty; that defines your own private creative domain. What crap you are willing to take, and what crap you’re not. What you are willing to relinquish control over, and what you aren’t. What price you are willing to pay, and what price you aren’t. Art suffers the moment other people start paying for it. The more you need the money, the more people will tell you what to do. The less control you will have. The more bullshit you will have to swallow. The less joy it will bring. Know this and plan accordingly. When I see somebody “suffering for their art,” it’s usually a case of their not knowing where that red line is. 17. The world is changing. If you want to be able to afford groceries in five years, I’d recommend listening closely to the (people who push change) and avoiding the (people who resist change). In order to navigate the New Realities you have to be creative - not just within your particular profession, but in everything. Your way of looking at the world will need to become ever more fertile and original. The old ways are dead. And you need people around you who concur. That means hanging out more with the creative people, the freaks, the real visionaries. They’re easy enough to find if you make the effort, if you’ve got something worthwhile to offer in return. Avoid the folk who play it safe. They can’t help you anymore. Their stability model no longer offers that much stability. They are extinct; they are extinction. 18. Merit can be bought. Passion can’t. The only people who can change the world are people who want to. And not everybody does. Part of understanding the creative urge is understanding that it’s primal. We think we’re “Providing a superior integrated logistic system” or “Helping America to really taste Freshness.” In fact we’re just pissed off and want to get the hell out of the cave and kill the woolly mammoth. 19. Avoid the Watercooler Gang. 20. Sing in your own voice. The really good artists, the really successful entrepreneurs, figure out how to circumvent their limitations, figure out how to turn their strengths into weaknesses. Had Bob Dylan been more of a technical virtuoso, he might not have felt the need to give his song lyrics such power and resonance. 21. The choice of media is irrelevant. My cartooning MO was and still is to just have a normal life, be a regular schmoe, with a terrific hobby on the side. It’s not exactly rocket science. This attitude seemed fairly alien to the Art Majors I met. Their chosen art form seemed more like a religion to them. It was serious. It was important. It was a big part of their identity, and it almost seemed to them that humanity’s very existence totally depended on their being able to pursue their dream as a handsomely rewarded profession. 22. Selling out is harder than it looks. Diluting your product to make it more “commercial” will just make people like it less. 23. Nobody cares. Do it for yourself. 24. Worrying about “Commercial vs. Artistic” is a complete waste of time. It’s not about whether Tom Clancy sells truckloads of books or a Nobel Prize winner sells diddly-squat. Those are just ciphers, external distractions. To me, it’s about what you are going to do with the short time you have left on this earth. Different criteria altogether. Frankly, how a person nurtures and develops his or her own “creative sovereignty,” with or without the help of the world at large, is in my opinion a much more interesting subject. 25. Don’t worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually. Find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long. Writer’s block is just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with the rather weird idea that you should feel the need to say something. Why? If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. 26. You have to find your own shtick. Jackson Pollock discovering splatter paint. Or Robert Ryman discovering all-white canvases. Andy Warhol discovering silk-screen. Hunter S. Thompson discovering gonzo journalism. Duchamp discovering the found object. Jasper Johns discovering the American flag. Hemingway discovering brevity. James Joyce discovering stream-of-consciousness prose. Somehow while playing around with something new, suddenly they found they were able to put their entire selves into it. 27. Write from the heart. 28. The best way to get approval is not to need it. 29. Power is never given. Power is taken. The minute you become ready is the minute you stop dreaming. Suddenly it’s no longer about “becoming.” Suddenly it’s about “doing.” You didn’t go in there, asking the editor to give you power. You went in there and politely informed the editor that you already have the power. That’s what being “ready” means. That’s what “taking power” means. Not needing anything from another person in order to be the best in the world. 30. Whatever choice you make, the Devil gets his due eventually. 31. The hardest part of being creative is getting used to it. 32. Remain frugal. Part of being creative is learning how to protect your freedom. That includes freedom from avarice. 33. Allow your work to age with you. You become older faster than you think. Be ready for it when it happens. 34. Being Poor Sucks. The biggest mistake young people make is underestimating how competitive the world is out there. 35. Beware of turning hobbies into jobs. James Gold-Smith once quipped, “When a man marries his mistress, he immediately creates a vacancy.” What’s true in philanderers is also true in life. “Before, this man had a job and a hobby. Now suddenly, he’s just got the job, but no hobby anymore. But a man needs both, you see. And now what does this man, who’s always had a hobby, do with his time?” My friend held up his glass. “Answer: Drink.” 36. Savor obscurity while it lasts. Once you “make it,” your work is never the same. if they were still “eating dog food” after a few decades, I doubt if they’d be waxing so lyrically. But as long as you can progress from it eventually, it’s a time to be savored. A time when your work is still new to you, a time when the world doesn’t need to be fed, 37. Start blogging. 38.

Tribes,Seth Godin,1591842336,8,"A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea. A group needs only two things to be a tribe : a shared interest and a way to communicate. Tribes need leadership. People want connection and growth and something new. They want change. Humans can't help it : we need to belong. One of the most powerful of our survival mechanismsis to be part of a tribe, to contribute to (and take from) a group of like-minded people. We are drawn to leaders and to their ideas, and we can't resist the rush of belonging and the thrill of the new. Some tribes are stuck. They embrace the status quo and drown out any tribe member who dares to question authority and the accepted order. Big charities, tiny clubs, struggling corporations - they're tribes and they're stuck. I'm not so interested in those tribes. They create little of value and they're sort of boring. Every one of those tribes, though, is a movement waiting to happen - a group of people just waiting to be energized and transformed. A movement is thrilling. It's the work of many people, all connected, all seeking something better. Leaders have followers. Managers have employees. Here's what's changed : some people admire the new and stylish far more than they respect the proven state of affairs. More often than not, these fad-focused early adopters are the people who buy and the people who talk. As a result, new ways of doing things, new jobs, new opportunities, and new faces become ever more important. Marketing, the verb, changed the market. The market is now a lot less impressed with average stuff for average people, and the market is a lot less impressed with loud and flashy and expensive advertising. Today, the market wants change. Jack, an ""occasional restaurant"" run by Danielle Sucher and Dave Turner in Brooklyn. They open the restaurant only about 20 times a year, on Saturday nights. By appointment. Go online and you can see the menu in advance. Then, you book and pay if you want to go. Instead of seeking diners for their dishes, they get to create dishes for their diners. Instead of serving anonymous patrons, they throw a party. Danielle is the food columnist for the popular Gothamist website, and she and Dave run the food blog Habeas Brûlée. That means they already interact with the tribe. It means that once the restaurant is up and running, it becomes the central clearinghouse, the place to hang out with the other tribe members. Leaders don't care very much for organizational structure or the official blessing of whatever factory they work for. They use passion and ideas to lead people, as opposed to using threats and bureaucracy to manage them. There's a difference between telling people what to do, and inciting a movement. The movement happens when people talk to one another, when ideas spread within the community, and most of all, when peer support leads people to do what they always knew was the right thing. Great leaders create movements by empowering the tribe to communicate. They establish the foundation for people to make connections, as opposed to commanding people to follow them. IMPROVING A TRIBE: It only takes two things to turn a group of people into a tribe: - A shared interest - A way to communicate The communication can be: - leader to tribe - tribe to leader - tribe member to tribe member - tribe member to outsider So a leader can help increase the effectiveness of the tribe and its members by: - transforming the shared interest into a passionate goal and desire for change - providing tools to allow members to tighten their communications - leveraging the tribe to allow it to grow and gain new members At SxSW, Scott Beale was tired of waiting in line to get into the Google party, so he walked down the street, found a deserted bar, grabbed some tables in the back, and used Twitter to announce, ""Alta Vista Party at Ginger Man"". Within minutes, 8 people showed up. Then 50, then a line out the door. Organizations are more important than ever. It's the factories we don't need. Organizations give us the ability to create complex products. They provide the muscle and consistency necessary to get things to market and to back them up. Most important, organizations have the scale to care for large tribes. Organizations of the future are filled with smart, fast, flexible people on a mission. Thing is, that requires leadership. We choose not to be remarkable because we're worried about criticism. We're worried, deep down, that someone will hate it and call us on it. Watch a few people get criticized for being innovative and it's pretty easy to convince yourself that the very same thing will happen to you if you're not careful. How can I create something that critics will criticize? All great leaders are generous - they enable the tribe to thrive. The most powerful way to enable is to be statueworthy : by getting out front, by making a point, by challenging convention, and by speaking up. It's easy to hestiate when confronted with the feeling that maybe you're getting too much attention. Great leaders are able to reflect the light onto their teams, their tribes. Great leaders don't want the attention, but they use it to unite the tribe and to reinforce its sense of purpose. When you abuse the attention, you are taking something from the tribe. When a CEO starts acting like a selfish monarch, he's no longer leading. He's taking. TIGHTER: The first thing a leader can focus on is the act of tightening the tribe. It's tempting to make the tribe bigger, to get more members, to spread the word. This pales, however, when juxtaposed with the effects of a tighter tribe. A tribe that communicates more quickly, with alacrity and emotion, is a tribe that thrives. A tighter tribe is one that is more likely to hear its leader, and more likely still to coordinate action and ideas across the members of the tribe. This tightening can happen without technology, and it can happen when there's no profit motive. Keith Ferrazzi leads a tribe of smart celebrities and opinion leaders - from Meg Ryan to Ben Zander - and he leads this unleadable group merely by tightening the tribe. He introduces people. He invites them to dinner. He finds areas of common interest then gets out of the way. DISCOMFORT IS WHERE THE LEADER IS NEEDED: It's uncomfortable to stand up in front of strangers. It's uncomfortable to propose an idea that might fail. It's uncomfortable to challenge the status quo. It's uncomfortable to resist the urge to settle. When you identify the discomfort, you've found the place where a leader is needed. If you're not uncomfortable in your work as a leader, it's almost certain you're not reaching your potential as a leader. FOLLOWERS / MICROLEADERSHIP: Blind sheep do nothing but mindlessly follow instructions. They don't do the local leadership required when tribe members interact. They're not going to do a very good job of recruiting new members. Evangelism requires leadership. People eagerly engage when they want something to improve. This microleadership is essential. It's the microleaders in the trenches and their enthusiastic followers who make the difference, not the honcho who is ostensibly running the group. Leaders work hard to generate movement that can transform a group into a tribe. The posture of leaning in is rare and valuable. When looking to hire - I set up a private Facebook group for the applicants and invited each one to participate. 60 of them joined immediately. No tribe existed yet - just 60 strangers. Within hours, a few had taken the lead, posting topics, starting discussions, leaning in and leading. They called on their peers to contribute and participate. And the rest? They lurked. Whom would you hire? Not all leadership involves getting in the face of the tribe. It takes just as much effort to successfully get out of the way. Jimmy Wales leads Wikipedia not by inciting, but by enabling others to fill the vacuum. The one path that never works is the most common one : doing nothing at all. The difference between backing off and doing nothing may appear subtle, but it's not. A leader who backs off is making a commitment to the power of the tribe, and is alert to the right moment to step back in. Someone who is doing nothing is merely hiding. Leadership is a choice. It's the choice to not do nothing. Lean in, back off, but don't do nothing. Others will scoff and move on, wondering what the obsession is all about. That's what makes a tribe, of course. There are insiders and outsiders. Curious is the key word. It has to do with a desire to understand, a desire to try, a desire to push whatever envelope is interesting. Leaders are curious because they can't wait to find out what the group is going to do next. The changes in the tribe are what are interesting, and curiosity drives them. In order to lead a tribe, all you need to do is motivate people who choose to follow you. KEEPING IT SMALL: Imagine two classrooms with similar teachers. One has 15 students, the other, 32. Which group gets a better education? The smaller class - because the teacher has more time to spend customizing the lesson to each student. She has fewer students, hence fewer disruptions as well. Great leaders don't try to please everyone. Great leaders don't water down their message in order to make the tribe a bit bigger. Instead, they realize that a motivated, connected tribe in the midst of a movement is far more powerful than a larger group could ever be. Some tribes do better when they're smaller. More exclusive. Harder to get into. Some tribes thrive precisely because they're small. Push to make one of these tribes bigger and you might just ruin the entire thing. ""No one goes there anymore - it's too popular."" Leaders who set out to give are more productive than leaders who set out to get. The tribes can sniff out why someone is asking for their attention. FAITH VS RELIGION: If you watch kids learning dyno (rock climbing) you'll see that the secret to developing the skill isn't about building their muscles or learning some exotic technique. It's merely about developing the faith that it'll work. Without faith, the leap never works. There are countless religions in our lives. The religion of Broadway determines what a musical is supposed to look and feel like. The religion of the MBA standard curriculum and perceptions of what is successful. Religion gives our faith a little support when it needs it. Religion at its best is a sort of mantra, a subtle but consistent reminder that belief is OK, and that faith is the way to get where you're going. Religion at its worst reinforces the status quo, often at the expense of our faith. Sticking, without variation, to principles prevented them from turning it into a new better kind of experience. Heretics challenge a given religion, but do it from a very strong foundation of faith. In order to lead, you must challenge the status quo of the religion you're living under. Successful heretics create their own religion. New group of friends, new supporters, new rituals. Recognize the need for faith in your idea. Find the tribe you need to support you and create a new religion around your faith. When you fall in love with a system, you lose the ability to grow. STATUS QUO vs BEING FIRST: Leadership almost always involves thinking and acting like the underdog. That's because leaders work to change things, and the people who are winning rarely do. Leaders go first. Initiating : see something others are ignoring and jump on it. Cause the events that others have to react to. Make change. Everyone believes that what they've got is probably better than the risk and fear that come with change. At first, the new thing is rarely as good as the old thing was. If you need the alternative to be better than the status quo from the very start, you'll never begin. Soon enough, the new thing will be better than the old thing. But if you wait until then, it's going to be too late. This isn't about having a great idea. The great ideas are out there, for free, on your neighborhood blog. This is about taking initiative and making things happen. Getting out first and staking out the new territory almost always pays off. When you hire amazing people and give them freedom, they do amazing stuff. The biggest step comes from anyone who teachers or hires. Embrace non-sheep behavior. Reward and cherish it. MICRO-MOVEMENT KEY ELEMENTS: 1. Publish a manifesto. Give it away and make it easy for the manifesto to spread far and wide. It doesn't have to be printed or even written. Bit it's a mantra and a motto and a way of looking at the world. It unites your tribe members and gives them a structure. 2. Make it easy for your followers to connect with you. It could be as simple as visiting you or emailing you or watching you on TV. Or it could be as rich and complex as interacting with you on Facebook or Ning. 3. Make it easy for your followers to connect with one another. There's that little nod that one restaurant regular gives to another recognized regular. Or the shared drink in an airport lounge. Even better is the camradarie developed by volunteers on a political campaign or insiders involved in a new product launch. Great leaders figure out how to make these interactions happen. 4. Realize that money is not the point of a movement. Money exists merely to enable it. The moment you try to cash out is the moment you stunt the growth of your movement. 5. Track your progress. Do it publicly and create pathways for your followers to contribute to that progress. PRINCIPLES: 1. Transparency really is your only option. Every failed televangelist has learned this the hard way. The people who follow you aren't stupid. You might go down in scandal or more likely from ennui. People can smell subterfuge from a mile away. 2. Your movement needs to be bigger than you. An author and his book, for example, don't constitute a movement. Changing the way people applly to college does. 3. Movements that grow, thrive. Every day they get better and more powerful. You'll get there soon enough. Don't mortgage today just because you're in a hurry. 4. Movements are made most clear when compared to the status quo or to movements that work to push the other direction. Movements do less well when compared to other movements with similar goals. Instead of beating them, join them. 5. Exclude outsiders. Exclusion is an extremely powerful force for loyalty and attention. Who isn't part of your movement matters almost as much as who is. 6. Tearing others down is never as helpful to a movement as building your followers up. The customer service staff shows up and follows the handbook and treats every customer the same, then can't figure out why they're being disrespected in return. Be willing to be wrong. Realize that wrong isn't fatal. The secret of leadership : paint a picture of the future. Go there. It's OK to abandon the big, established, stuck tribe. It's OK to say, ""You're not going where I need to go, and there's no way I'm going to persuade all of you to follow me. So rather than standing here watching the opportunities fade away, I'm heading off. I'm betting some of you, the best of you, will follow me."" You can build a bigger, faster, cheaper tribe than you used to be able to. Transaction costs are falling while the costs of formal organizations (offices, benefits, management) keep increasing. Many big organizations are getting bigger as a way of fighting off the power of the tribes. Hoping that formal nature of their bigness will somehow successfully fight off flexible, fast, and sometimes free power of the tribe. (Very unlikely.) If you hear my idea but don't believe it, that's not your fault - it's mine. If you are a student in my class and you don't learn what I'm teaching, I've let you down. It's really easy to insist that people read the manual. It's really easy to blame the user/student/customer for not trying hard, for being too stupid to get it, for not caring enough to pay attention. It's tempting to blame those in your tribe who aren't working as hard at following as you are at leading. But none of this is helpful. If no one cares, then you have no tribe. If you don't care - really and deeply care - then you can't possibly lead. Leaders create a culture around their goal and involve others in that culture. People want to be sure you heard what they said. They're less focused on whether or not you do what they said. Listen. Really listen. Then decide and move on. Find one person who trusts you and sell him a copy. Does he love it? Is he excited about it? Excited enough to tell 10 friends because it helps them, not because it helps you? Tribes grow when people recruit other people. That's how ideas spread as well. The tribe doesn't do it for you, of course. They do it for each other. A big part of leadership is the ability to stick with the dream for a long time. Long enough that the critics realize that you're going to get there one way or another - so they follow. People don't believe what you tell them. They rarely believe what you show them. Then often believe what their friends tell them. They always believe what they tell themselves. What leaders do : give people stories they can tell themselves. Stories about the future and about change.",Inspiring look at what it takes to organize and mobilize groups of people.
How to Talk to Anyone,Leil Lowndes,007141858X,8,"There are two kinds of people in this life: Those who walk into a room and say, “Well, here I am!” Those who walk in and say, “Ahh, there you are.” You see, nobody gets to the top alone.

The way you look and the way you move is more than 80 percent of someone’s first impression of you. Give ‘em great posture, a heads-up look, a confident smile, and a direct gaze. ** How to Make Your Smile Magically Different Technique (The Flooding Smile): Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overview into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them. A big, warm smile is an asset. But only when it comes a little slower, because then it has more credibility. It’s more sincere and personalized for the recipient. ** How to Strike Everyone as Intelligent and Insightful by Using Your Eyes Technique (Sticky Eyes): Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partner’s with sticky warm taffy. Don’t break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly, reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the tiny string finally breaks. In a case study, the subjects reported significantly higher feelings of respect and fondness for their colleagues who had been counting their blinks. ** How to Use Your Eyes to Make Someone Fall in Love with You Technique (Epoxy Eyes): This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact. It says, “I can’t take my eyes off you” or “I only have eyes for you.” Concentrate on the listener – your target- rather than the speaker. You are extremely interested in his or her reactions. ** How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their Inner Infant Technique (The Big-Baby Pivot): Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent towards the new person shouts ""I think you are very, very special."" ** How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once Technique (Hello Old Friend): When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (and old customer, and old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicissitudes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy mackerel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend! The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes - and everything between. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care...about them. Whenever you're traveling in countries where you don't speak the native tongue, be sure to use the ""hello old friend"" technique. When you act as though you like someone, you start to really like them. ** How to Come Across as 100 Credible to Everyone Technique (Limit the Fidget): Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you're fibbing. Fidgety movements give listeners the sense something just isn't right. Professional communicators, squelch any signs anyone could mistake for shiftiness. They fix a constant gaze on the listener. They never put their hands on their faces. They don't massage their arm when it tingles or rub their nose when it itches. They don't loosen their collar when it's hot or blink because it's sandy. They don't wipe away tiny perspiration beads in public or shield their eyes from the sun. ** How to Read People Like You Have ESP Technique (Han’s Horse Sense): Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express your self, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves accordingly. If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got horse sense. ** How to Make Sure You Don’t Miss a Single Beat Technique (Watch the Scene Before You Make the Scene): Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR yourself chatting comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating towards you. VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically. ####PART TWO: HOW TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY AFTER YOU SAY “HI” The brighter the individual, the more he or she detests small talk. ** How to Start Great Small Talk Technique (Make a Mood Match): Before opening your mouth, take a “voice sample” of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a “psychic photograph” of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment. Small talk is not about facts. Small talk is about putting people at ease. You must first match your listener’s mood. Top communicators pick up on their listener’s tone of voice and duplicate it. Every mother knows this instinctively. To quiet a whimpering infant, Mama doesn’t just shake her finger and shout, “Quiet down.” No, Mama picks baby up. Mama cries, “Ooh, ooh, oh,” sympathetically matching baby’s misery for a few moments. Mama then gradually transitions the two of them into hush-hush happy sounds. Your listeners are all big babies! ** How to Sound Like You’ve Got a Super Personality (No Matter What You’re Saying) Technique (Prosaic With Passion): Worries about your first words? Fear not, because 80 percent of you listener’s impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting. Almost anything you say really is OK – as long as it puts people at ease and sounds passionate. How do you put people at ease? By convincing them they are OK and that the two of you are similar. ** How to Make People Want to Start a Conversation with You Technique (Always Wear A Whatzit): Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your…what IS that?” Your business cards and your Whatzit are crucial socializing artifacts. ** How to Meet the People You Want to Meet Technique (Whoozat): Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by non-politicians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers. ** How to Break into a Tight Crowd Technique (Eavesdrop In): No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infiltrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear…” Will they be taken aback? Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily. Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely! ** How to Make “Where Are You From?” Sound Exciting Technique (Never the Naked City): Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, “And where are you from?” never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist. Your hook should relate to the type of person you’re speaking with. “No man would listen to you talk if he didn’t know it was his turn next.” ** How to Come Out a Winner Every Time They Ask, “And What Do You Do?” Technique (Never the Naked Job): When asked the inevitable “And what do you do,“you may think “I’m an economist/an educator/an engineer” is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying, “I’m a paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer.” Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray. ** How to Introduce People Like the Host(ess) with the Most(est) Technique (Never the Naked Introduction): When introducing people don’t throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big calm, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity. Help “newlymets” through their first nervous moments. Mention their hobby or even talent. ** How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation Technique (Be a Word Detective): Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partner’s every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for the other person. ** How to Enthrall ‘Em with Your Choice of Topic – Them! Technique (The Swiveling Spotlight): When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it’s shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you. “When I meet someone, I learn so much more if I ask about their life.” Grow more by listening than talking. ** How to Never Need to Wonder, “What Do I Say Next?” Technique (Parroting): Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen. ** How to Get ‘Em Happily Chatting (So You Can Slip Away if You Want To!) Technique: (Encore!): The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is “Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!” The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is “Tell them about the time you…” Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance. Make sure the story you request is one in which the teller shines. ** How to Come Across as a Positive Person Technique (Ac-cen-tu-ate the Positive): When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to “ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive. ####PART THREE: HOW TO TALK LIKE A VIP 85 percent of one’s success in life is directly due to communications skills. ** How to Find Out What They Do (Without Even Asking!) Technique (What Do you Do–NOT!): A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the conspicuous absence of the question, “What do you do?” (You determine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber, a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone who’s never strolled along Easy Street.) Big cats never ask outright, “What do you do?” (Oh they find out, all right, in a much more subtle manner.) By not asking the question, one comes across as more principled, even spiritual.” “How do you spend most of your time?” is a gracious way to ask. ** How to Know What to Say When They Ask “What Do You Do?” Technique (The Nutshell Resume): Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written resume off their printers for each position they’re applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to “What do you do?” ask yourself, “What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?” Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to work into your communications bag of tricks. My friend Roberto was out of work last year. He applied for two positions: a sales manager of an ice cream company and head of strategic planning for a fast-food chain. He did extensive research and found the ice cream company had deep sales difficulties and the food chain had long-range international aspirations. Did eh send the same resume to each? Absolutely not. His resume never deviated one iota from the truth of his background. However, for the ice cream company, he highlighted his experience turning a small company around by doubling its sales in three years. For the food chain, he underscored his experience working in Europe and his knowledge of foreign markets. Both firms offered Roberto the job. Now he could play them off against each other. He went to each, explaining he’d like to work for them but another firm was offering a higher salary or more perks. The two firms started bidding against each other for Roberto. He finally chose the food chain at almost double the salary they originally offered him. Ask yourself,”How could my professional experience benefit this person’s life?” When meeting a potential friend or loved one, make your life sound like you will be a fun person to know. ** How to Sound Even Smarter Than You Are Technique (Your Personal Thesaurus): Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements. Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite. Think of a few tired, overworked words you use every day – words like smart, nice, pretty, or good. Then grab a thesaurus. ** How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity) Technique (Kill the Quick “Me, Too!”): Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger. P.S. Don’t wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like you’re being tricky. You don’t want to sound anxious to have rapport. Instead of jumping in with, “Hey, me too!” let your conversation partner enjoy talking about it. When someone starts telling you about an activity he has done, a trip she has made, a club he belongs to, an interest she has – anything that you share-bite your tongue. ** How to Be a “You Firstie” to Gain Their Respect and Affection Technique (Comm-YOU-nication): Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immediately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate in into “me” terms. When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice. Suppose, you said, “Jill, you will really love this new Indian restaurant. Will you join me there this evening for dinner?” Phrasing it that way, you’ve already subliminally answered Jill’s questions and she’s more apt to give you a quick “yes.” ** How to Make Them Feel You “Don’t Smile at Just Anybody” Technique (The Exclusive Smile): If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confederate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty big players find in each new face. If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her. Have you ever seen those low-budget, mail-order fashion catalogues that use the same model throughout? Whether she is engulfed in a wedding gown or partially clad in a bikini, her face sports the same plastic smile. Looking at her, you get the feeling if you rapped on her forehead, a tiny voice would come back saying “Nobody’s in here.” Whereas models in more sophisticated magazines have mastered a myriad of different expressions: a flirtatious “I’ve got a secret” smile on one page; a quizzical “I think I’d like to get to know you but I’m not sure” smile on next; and a mysterious Mona Lisa smile on the third. You feel there’s a brain running the operation somewhere inside that beautiful head. ** How to Avoid Sounding Like a Jerk Technique (Don’t Touch a Cliché with a Ten-Foot Pole): Be on guard. Don’t use any clichés when chatting with big winners. Don’t even touch one with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob. Instead of coughing up a cliché, roll your own clever phrases by using the next technique ** How to Use Motivational Speakers’ Technique to Enhance Your Conversation Technique (Use Jawsmith’s Jive): Whether you’re standing behind a podium facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, you’ll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills. Read speakers’ books to cull quotations, pull pearls of wisdom, and get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make ‘em rhyme, make ‘em clever, or make ‘em funny. Above all, make ‘em relevant. ** How to banter Like the Big Shots Do (Big Winners Tell It Like It Is) Technique (Call a Spade a Spade): Don’t hide behind euphemisms. Call a spade a spade. That doesn’t mean big cats use tasteless four-letter words when perfectly decent five- and six-letter ones exist. They’ve simply learned the King’s English, and they speak it. Here’s another way to tell the big players from the little ones just by listening to a few minutes of their conversation. Big cats aren’t afraid of real words. If somebody is rich, big cats call it “rich.” Little cats, substitute the word wealthy. ** How to Avoid the World’s Worst Conversational Habits Technique (Trash the Teasing): A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone else’s expense may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have the last one. Because you’ll bang your head against the glass ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their paws. Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else’s expense. You’ll wind up paying for it, dearly. ** How to Give Them the Bad News (and Have Them Like You All the More) Technique (It’s the Receiver’s Ball): A football player wouldn’t last two beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the ball with the receiver always in mind. Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it. ** How to Respond When You Don’t Want to Answer (and Wish They’d Shut the Heck Up) Technique (The Broken Record): Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never fails to flick them off. ** How to Talk to a Celebrity Technique (Big Shots Don’t Slobber): People who are VIP’s in their own right don’t slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, don’t compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight it’s given you. If you do single out any one of the star’s accomplishments, make sure it’s a recent one, not a memory that’s getting yellow in her scrapbook. If the queen bee has a drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the conversation. ** How to Make Them Want to Thank You Technique (Never the Naked Thank You): Never let the phrase “thank you” stand alone. From A to Z, always follow it with for: from “Thank you for asking” to “Thank you for zipping me up.” ####PART FOUR: HOW TO BE AN INSIDER IN ANY CROWD ** How to Be a Modern Day Renaissance Man or Woman Technique (Scramble Therapy): Once a month, scramble your life. Do something you’d never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider questions from just one exposure. ** How to Sound Like You Know All About Their Job or Hobby Technique: (Learn a Little Jobbledygook): Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a second language. What is Jobbledygook? It’s the language of other professions. Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider. How do you learn it? You’ll find no Jobbledygook cassettes in the language section of your bookstore, but the lingo is easy to pick up. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd you’ll be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few and the rewards are manifold. ** How to Bare Their Hot Button (Elementary Doc-Talk) Technique (Baring Their Hot Button): Before jumping blindly into a bevy of bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons. ** How to Secretly Learn About Their Lives Technique (Read Their Rags): Is your next big client a golfer, runner, swimmer, surfer, or skier? Are you attending a social function filled with accountants or Zen Buddhists – or anything in between? There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than you’ll ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading the rags that serve their racket. (Have you read your latest copy of Zoonooz yet?) ** How to Talk When You’re in Other Countries Technique (Clear “Customs”): Before putting one toe on foreign soil, get a book on dos and taboos around the world. Before you shake hands, give a gift, make gestures, or even compliment anyone’s possessions, check it out. Your gaffe could gum up your entire gig. ** How to Talk Them into Getting the “Insider’s Price” (on Practically Anything You Buy) Technique (Bluffing For Bargains): The haggling skills used in ancient Arab markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal. Before every big purchase, find several vendors -a few to learn from and one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, you’re ready to head for the store where you’re going to buy. ####PART FIVE: HOW TO SOUND LIKE YOU’RE PEAS IN A POD **How to Make Them Feel You’re of the Same “Class” Technique (Be a Copyclass): Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy? Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your conversation partner subliminally real comfy with you. ** How to Make Them Feel That You’re Like “Family” Technique (Echoing): Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a powerful wallop. Listen to the speaker’s arbitrary choice of nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives - and echo them back. Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates subliminal rapport. It makes them feel you share their values, their attitides, their interests, their experiences. Use their words, not yours. ** How to Really Make It Clear to Them Technique (Potent Imaging): Does your customer have a garden? Talk about “sowing the seeds for success.” Does your boss own a boat? Tell him or her about a concept that will “hold water” or “stay afloat.” Maybe he is a private pilot? Talk about a concept really “taking off.” She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits the “sweet spot.” Evoke your listener’s interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give your points more power and punch, use analogies from your listener’s world, not your own. Potent Imaging also tells your listeners you think like them and hints you share their interests. ** How to Make Them Feel You Empathize (Without Just Saying “Yep, Uh Huh, Yeah”) Technique (Employ Empathizers): Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like “I see what you mean.” Sprinkle it with sentimental sparkles like “That’s a lovely thing to say.” Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue. ** How to Make Them Think You See/Hear/Feel It Just the Way They Do Technique (Anatomically Correct Empathizers): What part of their anatomy are your associates talking through? Their eyes? Their ears? Their gut? For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make them think you feel the same way they do. Suppose a business colleague describing a financial plan says, “With this plan, we can see out way clear in six months.” Since this time she’s using primary visual references, say “I see what you mean” or “You really have a clear picture of that situation. If, instead, your colleague had said, “This plan has a good ring to it, “you’d substitute auditory empathizers like “It does sound great,” or “I hear you.” A third possibility. Suppose she had said, “I have a gut feeling this plan will work. “Now you give her a kinesthetic empathizer like “I can understand how you feel,” or “You have a good grasp of that problem.” ** How to Make ‘Em Think We (Instead of You vs. Me) Technique (The Premature We): Create the sensation of intimacy with someone even if you’ve met just moments before. Scramble the signals in their psyche by skipping conversational levels one and two and cutting right to level three and four. Elicit intimate feelings by using the magic words we, us, and our. Use the word “we” prematurely. At a party, you might say to someone standing behind you ate the buffet line, “Hey, this looks great. They really laid out a nice spread for us.” Or, “Uh-oh, we’re going to get fat if we let ourselves enjoy all of this. ** How to Create a Friendly “Private Joke” with Them Technique (Instant History): When you meet a stranger you’d like to make less a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just like old friends, you have a history together, and Instant History. With anyone you’d like to make part of your personal or professional future, look for special moments together. Then make them a refrain. ####PART SIX: HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE THE POWER OF PRAISE FROM THE FOLLY OF FLATTERY Mind boggling, isn’t it? Sociologists’ research shows: 1) a compliment from a new person is more potent than from someone you already know, 2) your compliment has more credibility when given to an unattractive person or an attractive person whose face you’ve never seen, 3) you are taken more seriously if you preface your comments by some self-effacing remark-but only if your listener perceives you as higher on the totem pole. If you’re lower, your self-effacing remark reduces your credibility. ** How to Compliment Someone (Without Sounding Like You’re Brownnosing) Technique (Grapevine Glory): A compliment one hears is never as exciting as the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend. This way you escape possible suspicion that you are an apple-polishing, bootlicking, egg-sucking, back-scratching sycophant trying to win brownie points. You also leave recipients with the happy fantasy that you are telling the whole world about their greatness. ** How to Be a “Carrier Pigeon” of Good Feelings Technique (Carrier Pigeon Kudos): People immediately grow a beak and metamorphosize themselves into carrier pigeons when there’s bad news. (It’s called gossip.) Instead, become a carrier of good news and kudos. Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment. Your fans may not posthumously stuff you and put you on display in a museum like Stumpy Joe. But everyone loves the carrier pigeon of kind thoughts. ** How to Make ‘Em Feel Your Admiration “Just Slipped Out” Technique (Implied Magnificence): Throw a few comments into your conversation that presuppose something positive about the person you’re talking with. But be careful. Don’t blow it like the well intentioned maintenance man. Or the southern boy who, at the prom, through he was flattering his date when he told her, “Gosh, Mary Lou, for a fat gal you dance real good.” ** How to Win Their Hears by Being an “Undercover Complimenter” Technique (Accidental Adulation): Become an undercover complimenter. Stealthily sneak praise into the parenthetical part of your sentence. Just don’t try to quiz anyone later on your main point. The joyful jolt of your accidental adulation strikes them temporarily deaf to anything that follows. ** How to Make ‘Em Never Forget You with a “Killer Compliment” Technique (Killer Compliment): Whenever you are talking with a stranger you’d like to make part of your professional or personal future, search for one attractive, specific, and unique quality he or she has. At the end of the conversation, look the individual right in the eye. Say his or her name and proceed to curl all ten toes with the Killer Compliment. A Killer Compliment is more like “What exquisite eyes you have,” (very specific) or “You have a wonderful air of honesty about you,” (very personal). ** How to Make ‘Em Smile with Itty-Bitty Boosters Technique (Little Strokes): Don’t make your colleagues, your friends, your loved ones look at you and silently say, “Haven’t I been pretty good today?” Let them know how much you appreciate them by caressing them with verbal Little Strokes like “Nice job!” “Well done!” “Cool!” ** How to Praise with Perfect Timing Technique (The Knee-Jerk “Wow!”): Quick as a blink, you must praise people the moment they finish a feat. In a wink, like a knee-jerk reaction say “You were terrific!” Don’t worry that they won’t believe you. The euphoria of the moment has a strangely numbing effect on the achiever’s objective judgment. ** How to Make ‘Em Want to Compliment You Technique (Boomeranging): Just as a boomerang flies right back to the thrower, let compliments boomerang right back to the giver. Like the French, quickly murmur something that expresses “That’s very kind of you.” ** How to Make a Loved One Feel You Are THE Partner for Life Technique (The Tombstone Game): Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but don’t mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say “I appreciate you” or “I love you.” Fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier. You take people’s breath away when you feed their deepest self-image to them in a compliment. “At last,” they say to themselves, “someone who loves me for who I truly am.” We say to ourselves, “Maybe the world will little note nor long remember how brilliant, how wonderful, how witty, how creative or caring I really am. However, those who truly know and love me – they will recognize my greatness, my magic, my specialness over all other ordinary mortals.” When we find people with supernatural powers of perception to recognize our remarkableness, we become addicted to the heady drug of their appreciation. Telling him you admire him for the same reason he admires himself has an impact on Joe like no other compliment in the world. ####PART SEVEN: HOW TO DIRECT DIAL THEIR HEARTS ** How to Sound More Exciting on the Phone Technique (Talking Gestures): Think of yourself as the star of a personal radio drama every time you pick up the phone. If you want to come across as engaging as you are, you must turn your smiles into sound, your nods into noise, and all your gestures into something your listener can hear. You must replace your gestures with talk. Then punch up the whole act 30 percent! ** How to Sound Close (Even if You’re Hundreds of Miles Away) Technique (Name Shower): People perk up when they hear their own name. Use it more often on the phone than you would in person to keep their attention. Your caller’s name re-creates the eye contact, the caress, you might give in person. Saying someone’s name repeatedly when face-to-face sounds pandering. But because there is physical distance between you on the phone –sometimes you’re a continent apart-you can spray your conversation with it. ** How to Make ‘Em Happy They Called You Technique (“Oh Wow, It’s You!”): Don’t answer the phone with an “I’m just sooo happy all the time” attitude. Answer warmly, crisply, and professionally. Then, after you hear who is calling, let a huge smile of happiness engulf your entire face and spill over into your voice. You make your caller feel as through your giant warm fuzzy smile is reserved for him or her. **How to Sneak Past the Gatekeeper Technique (The Sneaky Screen): If you must screen your calls, instruct your staff to first say cheerfully, “Oh yes, I’ll put you right through. May I tell her who’s calling?” If the party has already identified himself, it’s “Oh of course, Mr. Whoozit. I’ll put you right though.” When the secretary comes back with the bad news that Mr. or Ms. Bigwig is unavailable, callers don’t take it personally and never feel screened. They fall for it every time, just like I did. ** How to Get What You Want on the Phone from Big Shots Technique (Salute the Spouse): Whenever you are calling someone’s home, always identify and greet the person who answers. Whenever you call someone’s office more than once or twice, make friends with the secretary. Anybody who is close enough to answer the phone is close enough to sway the VIP’s opinion of you. ** How to Get What You Want – by Timing! Technique (What Color Is Your Time?): No matter how urgent you think your call, always begin by asking the person about timing. Either use the What Color Is Your Time? Device or simply ask, “Is this a convenient time for you to talk?” When you ask about timing first, you’ll never smash your footprints right in the middle of your telephone partner’s sands of time. You’ll never get a “No!” just because your timing wasn’t right. ** How to Impress Everyone with Your Outgoing Voicemail Message Technique (Constantly Changing Outgoing Message): If you want to be perceived as conscientious and reliable, leave a short, professional, and friendly greeting as your outgoing message. No music. No jokes. No inspirational messages. No boasts, bells, or whistles. And here’s the secret: change it every day. Your message doesn’t have to be flawless. A little cough or stammer gives a lovely unpretentious reality to your message. ** How to Get Them to Call You Back Technique (Your Ten-Second Audition): While dialing, clear your throat. If an answering machine picks up, pretend the beep is a big Broadway producer saying “Nexxxt.” Now you’re on. This is Your Ten-Second Audition to prove you are worthy of a quick callback. **How to Make the Gatekeeper Think You’re Buddy-Buddy with the VIP Technique (The Ho-Hum Caper): Instead of using your party’s name, casually let the pronoun he or she roll off your tongue. Forget “Uh, may I speak to Ms. Bigshot please?” Just announce, “Hi, Bob Smith here, is she in?” Tossing the familiar she off your tongue signals to the secretary that you and her boss are old buddies. ** How to Make Them Say You Have Super Sensitivity Technique (I Hear Your Other Line): When you hear a phone in the background, stop speaking-in midsentence, if necessary-and say “I hear you r other line,” (or your dog is barking, your baby is crying, your spouse calling you). Ask whether she has to attend to it. Whether she does or not, she’ll know you’re a top communicator for asking. **How to “Listen Between the Lines” on the Phone Technique (Instant Replay): Record all your business conversations and listen to them again. The second or third time, you pick up significant subtleties you missed the first time. It’s like football fans who often don’t know if there was a fumble until they see it all over again in Instant Replay. ####PART EGHT: HOW TO WORK A PARTY LIKE A POLITICIAN WORKS A ROOM Ask “Who’s coming?” As the party giver chats casually about the guest list, politicians scribble the names of the people who interest them, then resolve to meet each. Biggies get there early to start hitting their marks as each arrives. VIP’s frequently come early to get their business done before party regulars who “hate to be the first one there” start arriving. Once they’ve accomplished what they set out to do, they’re on their way to the next opportunity. Why is the Party Being Given? Their knowledge also makes them valuable agents for the party giver. A savvy politician introduces the job-seeking daughter to some executives at the party or tells the most alluring women at the bash what a great guy birthday boy is. When chatting with reporter, he talks up the host’s business that needs good PR. Using “The Business Card Dossier” technique described later in this section, they decide how, when, and if to deal with each. Does this person require a phone call? Should that one receive a handwritten note? Shall I E-mail or call the other one? ** How to Avoid the Most Common Party Blooper Technique (Munching Or Mingling): Politicians want to be eyeball to eyeball and belly to belly with their constituents. Like any big winner well versed in the science of proxemics and spatial relationships, they know any object except their belt buckle has the effect of a brick wall between two people. Therefore they never hold food or drink at a party. Come to munch or come to mingle. But do not expect to do both. Like a good politician, chow down before you come. Politicians always eat before they come to the party. ** How to Make an Unforgettable Entrance Technique (Rubberneck the Room): When you arrive at the gathering, stop dramatically in the doorway. Then s-l-o-w-l-y survey the situation. Let your eyes travel back and forth like a SWAT team ready in a heartbeat to wipe out anything that moves. It is significant that, while you’re standing in the doorway, you’re not thinking, “Look at me.” The reason you’re Rubbernecking the Room is not to show off. It is so you can diagnose the situation you’re walking into. Take note of the lighting, the bar, and most important, the faces. Listen to the music, the buzz of the crowd, the clinking of glasses. ** How to Meet the People YOU Want to Meet Technique (Be The Chooser, Not the Choosee): The lifelong friend, the love of you life, or the business contact who will transform your future may not be at the party. However, someday, somewhere, he or she will be. Make every party a rehearsal for the big event. Do not stand around waiting for the moment when that special person approaches you . You make it happen by exploring every face in the room. No more “ships passing in the night.” Capture whatever or whomever you want in your life. ** How to Subliminally Lure People to You at a Gathering Technique (Come-Hither Hands): Be a human magnet, not a human repellent. When standing at a gathering, arrange your body in an open position-especially your arms and hands. People instinctively gravitate toward open palms and wrists seductively arranged in the “come hither” position. They shy away from knuckles in the “get lost or I’ll punch you” position. Use your wrists and palms to say “I have nothing to hide,” “I accept you and what you’re saying,” or “I find you sexy.” Women instinctively turn their wrists and palms upward when a man excites them. Position yourself near a doorway since everyone must pass your way at some point in the evening. ** How to Make ‘Em Feel Like a Movie Star Technique (Tracking): Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your conversation partners’ lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a powerful sense of intimacy. When you invoke the last major or minor event in anyone’s life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom. Politicians make a science out of Tracking. They keep a little black box either on their desk, in their computer, or in their brain of the last concern, enthusiasm, or event discussed with everyone in their life. They keep track of where the people were, what they said, and what they were doing since the last conversation. Then the first words of the next phone call or meeting with that person relates to that information. ** How to Amaze Them with What You Remember About Them Technique (The Business Card Dossier): Right after you’ve talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation: his favorite restaurant, sport, movie, or drink; whom she admires, where she grew up, a high school honor; or maybe a joke he told. In your next communication, toss off a reference to the favorite restaurant, sport, movie, drink, hometown, high school honor. Or reprieve the laugh over the great joke. ** How to Make the Sale with Your Eyeballs Technique (Eyeball Selling): The human body is a twenty-four-hour broadcasting station that transmits “You thrill me.” “You bore me.” “I love that aspect of your product.” “That one puts my feet to sleep.” Set the hidden cameras behind your eyeballs to pick up on all your customers’ and friends’ signals. Then plan your pitch and your pace accordingly. ####PART NINE: HOW TO BREAK THE MOST TREACHEROUS GLASS CEILING OF ALL How many times has one of your associates made a dumb, insensitive gaffe? How often have you written somebody off because of some stupid move” Do you think he knew what he was doing? Of course not. He had no idea he was crossing a line or stepping on your toes. Probably no one ever told him about the subtleties we’re going to discuss in this final section of Hot to Talk to Anyone. ** How to Win Their Affection by Overlooking Their Bloopers Technique (See No Bloopers, Hear No Bloopers): Cool communicators allow their friends, associates, acquaintances, and loved ones the pleasurable myth of being above commonplace bloopers and embarrassing biological functions. They simply don’t notice their comrades’ minor spills, slips, fumbles, and faux pas. They obviously ignore raspberries and all other signs of human frailty in their fellow mortals. Big winners never gape at another’s gaffes. People hate to be reminded of the moments when they’re not shining. ** How to Win Their Heart When Their Tongue is Faltering Technique (Lend A Helping Tongue): Whenever someone’s story is aborted, let the interruption play itself out. Give everybody time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story –interrupts, “Now please get back to your story.” Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, “So what happened after the…” (and fill in the last few words) ** How to Let ‘Em Know “What’s In It” for Them Technique (Bare the Buried WIIFM (and WIIFY): Whenever you suggest a meeting or ask a favor, divulge the respective benefits. Reveal what’s in it for you and what’s in it for the other person-even if it’s zip. If any hidden agenda comes up later, you get labeled a sly fox. ** How to Make Them Want to Do Favors for You Technique (Let ‘Em Savor the Favor): Whenever a friend agrees to a favor, allow your generous buddy time to relish the joy of his or her beneficence before you make them pay the piper. How long? At least twenty-four hours. ** How to Ask for Favors (and Get Them!) Technique (Tit for [Wait . . . Wait] Tat): When you do someone a favor and it’s obviously that “he owes you one,” wait a suitable amount of time before asking him to “pay.” Let him enjoy the fact (or fiction) that you did it out of friendship. Don’t call in your tit for their tat too swiftly. ** How to Know What Not to Say at Parties Technique (Parties Are for Pratter): There are three sacred safe havens in the human jungle where even the toughest tiger knows he must no attack. The first of these is parties. Parties are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations. Big players, even when standing next to their enemies at the buffet table, smile and nod. They leave tough talk for tougher setting. ** How to Know What Not to Say at Dinner Technique (Dinner’s For Dining): The most guarded safe haven respected by big winners is the dining table. Breaking bread together is a time when they bring up no unpleasant matters. While eating, they know it’s OK to brainstorm and discuss the positive side of the business: their dreams, their desires, their designs. They can free associate and come up with new ideas. But no tough business. Only after they have played out this crucial charade can they discuss business. But no dirty business. The biggies can brainstorm over coffee. They can discuss proposals over dessert. They can toss around new ideas over cordials. They can explore the positive side of the merger, the acquisition, or the partnership while waiting for the check. ** How to Know What Not to Say in a Chance Meeting Technique (Chance Encounters Are for Chitchat): If you’re selling, negotiating, or in any sensitive communication with someone, do NOT capitalize on a chance meeting. Keep the melody of your mistaken meeting sweet and light. Otherwise, it could turn into your swan song with Big Winner. ** How to Prepare Them to Listen to You Technique (Empty Their Tanks): If you need information, let people have their entire say first. Wait patiently until their needle is on empty and the last drop drips out and splashes on the cement. It’s the only way to be sure their tank is empty enough of their own inner noise to start receiving your ideas. ** How to Turn Their Anger Around (in Three Sentences or Less) Technique (Echo the Emo): Facts speak. Emotions shout. Whenever you need facts from people about an emotional situation, let them emote. Hear their facts but empathize like mad with their emotions. Smearing on the emo is often the only way to calm their emotional storm. ** How to Make ‘Em Like You (Even When You’ve Messes Up): Technique (My Goof, Your Gain): Whenever you make a boner, make sure your victim benefits. It’s not enough to correct your mistake. Ask yourself, “What could I do for this suffering soul so he or she will be delighted I made the flub?” Then do it, fast! In that way, your goof will become your gain. ** How to trap a Rat with Class Technique (Leave an Escape Hatch): Whenever you catch someone lying, filching, exaggerating, distorting, or deceiving, don’t confront the dirty duck directly. Unless it is your responsibility to catch or correct the culprit-or unless you are saving other innocent victims by doing so-let the transgressor out of your trap with his tricky puss in one piece. Then resolve never to gaze upon it again. Why do big winners let bad-news people get away with bummers? By closing your mouth (and then the door forever), you are saying, “You are so beneath me I’m not going to even waste my words on you.” ** How to Get Whatever You Want from Service Personnel Technique (Buttercups for Their Boss): Do you have a store clerk, accountant, law firm junior partner, tailor, auto mechanic, maître d’, massage therapist, kid’s teacher-or any other worker you want special attention from in the future? The surefire way to make them care enough to give you their very best is send a buttercup to their boss. ** How to Be a Leader in a Crowd, Not a Follower Technique (Lead the Listeners): No matter how prominent the big cat behind the podium is, crouched inside is a little scaredy-cat who is anxious about the crowd’s acceptance. Big winners recognize you’re a fellow big winner when they see you leading their listeners in a positive reaction. Be the first to applaud or publicly commend the man or woman you agree with (or want favors from). ** How to Make All the Right Moves Technique (The Great Scorecard in the Sky): Any two people have an invisible scorecard hovering above their heads. The numbers continually fluctuate, but one rule remains: players with lower score pays deference to player with higher score. The penalty for not keeping your eye on The Great Scorecard in the Sky is to be thrown out of the game. Permanently. Big winners-before putting pen to paper, fingers to keyboard, mouth to phone, or hand to someone else’s to shake it-do a quick calculation. They ask themselves “Who has the most to benefit from this relationship? What has each of us done recently that demand deference from the other?” And what can I do to even the score?","Wonderful considerate book about conversational people skills. (Warning: it’s written in an extremely flowery style, but try to see past that to get to the good stuff.) Gives specific instructions that are really useful for people who are not naturals. Just do what this book says, and people will warm up to you."
Brain Rules,John Medina,0979777704,8,"==== SUMMARY: ## RULE #1 : Exercise boosts brain power. The human brain evolved under conditions of almost constant motion. From this, one might predict that the optimal environment for processing information would include motion. That is exactly what one finds. Indeed, the best business meeting would have everyone walking at about 1.8 miles per hour. Researchers studied two elderly populations that had led different lifestyles, one sedentary and one active. Cognitive scores were profoundly influenced. Exercise positively affected executive function, spatial tasks, reaction times and quantitative skills. So researchers asked: If the sedentary populations become active, will their cognitive scores go up? Yes, it turns out, if the exercise is aerobic. In four months, executive functions vastly improve; longer, and memory scores improve as well. Exercise improves cognition for two reasons: - Exercise increases oxygen flow into the brain, which reduces brain-bound free radicals. One of the most interesting findings of the past few decades is that an increase in oxygen is always accompanied by an uptick in mental sharpness. - Exercise acts directly on the molecular machinery of the brain itself. It increases neurons’ creation, survival, and resistance to damage and stress. ## RULE #2 : The human brain evolved, too. The brain is a survival organ. It is designed to solve problems related to surviving in an unstable outdoor environment and to do so in nearly constant motion (to keep you alive long enough to pass your genes on). We were not the strongest on the planet but we developed the strongest brains, the key to our survival. The strongest brains survive, not the strongest bodies. Our ability to solve problems, learn from mistakes, and create alliances with other people helps us survive. We took over the world by learning to cooperate and forming teams with our neighbors. Our ability to understand each other is our chief survival tool. Relationships helped us survive in the jungle and are critical to surviving at work and school today. If someone does not feel safe with a teacher or boss, he or she may not perform as well. If a student feels misunderstood because the teacher cannot connect with the way the student learns, the student may become isolated. There is no greater anti-brain environment than the classroom and cubicle. ## RULE #3 : Every brain is wired differently. What YOU do and learn in life physically changes what your brain looks like – it literally rewires it. We used to think there were just 7 categories of intelligence. But categories of intelligence may number more than 7 billion — roughly the population of the world. No two people have the same brain, not even twins. Every student’s brain, every employee’s brain, every customer’s brain is wired differently. You can either accede to it or ignore it. The current system of education ignores it by having grade structures based on age. Businesses such as Amazon are catching on to mass customization (the Amazon homepage and the products you see are tailored to your recent purchases). Regions of the brain develop at different rates in different people. The brains of school children are just as unevenly developed as their bodies. Our school system ignores the fact that every brain is wired differently. We wrongly assume every brain is the same. Most of us have a “Jennifer Aniston” neuron (a neuron lurking in your head that is stimulated only when Jennifer Aniston is in the room). Theory of Mind : The ability to understand the interior motivations of someone else, and the ability to construct a predictable ""theory of how their mind works"" based on that knowledge. We try to see our entire world in terms of motivations, ascribing motivations to our pets and even to inanimate objects. The skill is useful for selecting a mate, navigating the day-to-day issues surrounding living together, for parenting. We have it like no other creature. It is as close to mind reading as we are likely to get. People with advanced Theory of Mind skills possess the single most important ingredient for becoming effective communicators of information. If someone does not feel safe with a teacher or boss, they may not be able to perform as well. If a student feels misunderstood because the teacher cannot connect with the way the student learns, the student may become isolated. ## RULE #4 : We don't pay attention to boring things. What we pay attention to is profoundly influenced by memory. Our previous experience predicts where we should pay attention. Culture matters too. Whether in school or in business, these differences can greatly effect how an audience perceives a given presentation. We pay attention to things like emotions, threats and sex. Regardless of who you are, the brain pays a great deal of attention to these questions: Can I eat it? Will it eat me? Can I mate with it? Will it mate with me? Have I seen it before? The brain is not capable of multi-tasking. We can talk and breathe, but when it comes to higher level tasks, we just can’t do it. Driving while talking on a cell phone is like driving drunk. The brain is a sequential processor and large fractions of a second are consumed every time the brain switches tasks. This is why cell-phone talkers are a half-second slower to hit the brakes and get in more wrecks. Workplaces and schools actually encourage this type of multi-tasking. Walk into any office and you’ll see people sending e-mail, answering their phones, Instant Messaging, and on MySpace — all at the same time. Research shows your error rate goes up 50% and it takes you twice as long to do things. When you’re always online you’re always distracted. So the always online organization is the always unproductive organization. If a teacher can't hold a student's interest, knowledge will not be richly encoded in the brain's database. Brains in wild animals are 15%-30% larger than tame, domestic counterparts. The cold, hard world forced the wild animals into constant learning mode. It is the same with humans. The more activity you do, the larger and more complex it can become. The brain cannot multi-task. It is a myth. The brain focuses attention on concepts sequentially, one at a time. Switching takes time. ## RULE #5 : Repeat to remember. The human brain can only hold about seven pieces of information for less than 30 seconds! Which means, your brain can only handle a 7-digit phone number. If you want to extend the 30 seconds to a few minutes or even an hour or two, you will need to consistently re-expose yourself to the information. Memories are so volatile that you have to repeat to remember. Improve your memory by elaborately encoding it during its initial moments. Many of us have trouble remembering names. If at a party you need help remembering Mary, it helps to repeat internally more information about her. “Mary is wearing a blue dress and my favorite color is blue.” It may seem counterintuitive at first but study after study shows it improves your memory. Brain Rules in the classroom. In partnership with the University of Washington and Seattle Pacific University, Medina tested this Brain Rule in real classrooms of 3rd graders. They were asked to repeat their multiplication tables in the afternoons. The classrooms in the study did significantly better than the classrooms that did not have the repetition. If brain scientists get together with teachers and do research, we may be able to eliminate need for homework since learning would take place at school, instead of the home. The first few seconds of encoding new information is crucial in determining whether something that is initially perceived will be remembered. The more elaborately we encode information at the moment of learning, the stronger the memory. When encoding is elaborate and deep, the memory that forms is much more robust than when encoding is partial and cursory. The neural pathways initially used to process new information end up becoming the permanent pathways the brain reuses to store the information. (Like the college professor that made no sidewalks in the new campus. He waited to see where students would walk anyway, then later paved the paths.) The more a learning focuses on the meaning of the processed information, the more elaborately the encoding is processed. When you are trying to drive a piece of information into your brain's memory, make sure you understand exactly what that information means. If you are trying to drive information into someone else's brain, make sure they understand what it means. Don't try to memorize by rote and pray the meaning will reveal itself! The more repetition cycles a memory experienced, the more likely it is to persist in your mind. The space between repetitions is the critical component for transforming temporary memories into more persistent forms. Spaced learning is greatly superior to massed learning. Deliberately re-expose yourself to information *more elaborately*, in fixed spaced intervals, to make retrieval the most vivid it can be. Learning occurs best when new information is incorporated gradually into the memory store rather than jammed in all at once. Physically, ""student"" neurons need to get the same information from the ""teacher"" neuron within 90 minutes, or its excitement will vanish. The cell will literally reset itself to zero and act as if nothing happened. Information must be repeated after a period of time has elapsed. If the information is repeatedly pulsed in discretely timed intervals, the relationship between teacher and student neuron begins to change, so increasingly smaller and smaller inputs from the teacher are required to elicit increasingly stronger and stronger outputs from the student. Forgetting allows us to prioritize events. Events irrelevant to our survival will take up wasteful cognitive space if we assign them the same priority as events critical to our survival. So we don't. In school, every 3rd or 4th day would be reserved for reviewing the facts delivered in the previous 3-4 days. Previous information would be presented in compressed fashion. Inspect notes, comparing with what the teacher was saying in the review. That would result in a greater elaboration of the information. A formalized exercise in error-checking. ## RULE #6 : Remember to repeat. It takes years to consolidate a memory. Not minutes, hours, or days but years. What you learn in first grade is not completely formed until your sophomore year in high school. Medina’s dream school is one that repeats what was learned, not at home, but during the school day, 90-120 minutes after the initial learning occurred. Our schools are currently designed so that most real learning has to occur at home. How do you remember better? Repeated exposure to information / in specifically timed intervals / provides the most powerful way to fix memory into the brain. Forgetting allows us to prioritize events. But if you want to remember, remember to repeat. ## RULE #7 : Sleep well, think well. When we’re asleep, the brain is not resting at all. It is almost unbelievably active! It’s possible that the reason we need to sleep is so that we can learn. Sleep must be important because we spend 1/3 of our lives doing it! Loss of sleep hurts attention, executive function, working memory, mood, quantitative skills, logical reasoning, and even motor dexterity. We still don’t know how much we need! It changes with age, gender, pregnancy, puberty, and so much more. Napping is normal. Ever feel tired in the afternoon? That’s because your brain really wants to take a nap. There's a battle raging in your head between two armies. Each army is made of legions of brain cells and biochemicals –- one desperately trying to keep you awake, the other desperately trying to force you to sleep. Around 3 p.m., 12 hours after the midpoint of your sleep, all your brain wants to do is nap. Taking a nap might make you more productive. In one study, a 26-minute nap improved NASA pilots’ performance by 34 percent. Don’t schedule important meetings at 3 p.m. It just doesn’t make sense. Students given a series of math problems that all had a shortcut that was not revealed to them. Only 20% found the shortcut if answers had to be given same-day. But if asked after sleep, 60% found the shortcut. No matter how many times the experiment is run, the sleep group consistently outperforms the non-sleep group about to 3 to 1. ## RULE #8 : Stressed brains don't learn the same way. You brain is built to deal with stress that lasts about 30 seconds. The brain is not designed for long term stress when you feel like you have no control. The saber-toothed tiger ate you or you ran away but it was all over in less than a minute. If you have a bad boss, the saber-toothed tiger can be at your door for years, and you begin to deregulate. If you are in a bad marriage, the saber-toothed tiger can be in your bed for years, and the same thing occurs. You can actually watch the brain shrink. Stress damages virtually every kind of cognition that exists. It damages memory and executive function. It can hurt your motor skills. When you are stressed out over a long period of time it disrupts your immune response. You get sicker more often. It disrupts your ability to sleep. You get depressed. The emotional stability of the home is the single greatest predictor of academic success. If you want your kid to get into Harvard, go home and love your spouse. You have one brain. The same brain you have at home is the same brain you have at work or school. The stress you are experiencing at home will affect your performance at work, and vice versa. ## RULE #9 : Stimulate more of the senses. Our senses work together so it is important to stimulate them! Your head crackles with the perceptions of the whole world, sight, sound, taste, smell, touch, energetic as a frat party. Smell is unusually effective at evoking memory. If you're tested on the details of a movie while the smell of popcorn is wafted into the air, you'll remember 10-50% more. Smell is really important to business. When you walk into Starbucks, the first thing you smell is coffee. They have done a number of things over the years to make sure that’s the case. The learning link. Those in multisensory environments always do better than those in unisensory environments. They have more recall with better resolution that lasts longer, evident even 20 years later. - students learn better from words and pictures than words alone - students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaenously - students learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near to each other rather than far from each on the page or screen - students learn better when extraneous material is excluded rather than included - students learn better from animation and narration than from animation and on-screen text ## RULE #10 : Vision trumps all other senses. We are incredible at remembering pictures. Hear a piece of information, and three days later you'll remember 10% of it. Add a picture and you'll remember 65%. Pictures beat text as well, in part because reading is so inefficient for us. Our brain sees words as lots of tiny pictures, and we have to identify certain features in the letters to be able to read them. That takes time. Why is vision such a big deal to us? Perhaps because it's how we've always apprehended major threats, food supplies and reproductive opportunity. Toss your PowerPoint presentations. It’s text-based (nearly 40 words per slide), with six hierarchical levels of chapters and subheads—all words. Professionals everywhere need to know about the incredible inefficiency of text-based information and the incredible effects of images. Burn your current PowerPoint presentations and make new ones. ## RULE #11 : Male and female brains are different. What’s different? Mental health professionals have known for years about sex-based differences in the type and severity of psychiatric disorders. Males are more severely afflicted by schizophrenia than females. By more than 2 to 1, women are more likely to get depressed than men, a figure that shows up just after puberty and remains stable for the next 50 years. Males exhibit more antisocial behavior. Females have more anxiety. Most alcoholics and drug addicts are male. Most anorexics are female. Men and women handle acute stress differently. When researcher Larry Cahill showed them slasher films, men fired up the amygdale in their brain’s right hemisphere, which is responsible for the gist of an event. Their left was comparatively silent. Women lit up their left amygdale, the one responsible for details. Having a team that simultaneously understood the gist and details of a given stressful situation helped us conquer the world. Men and women process certain emotions differently. Emotions are useful. They make the brain pay attention. These differences are a product of complex interactions between nature and nurture. ## RULE #12 : We are powerful and natural explorers. The desire to explore never leaves us despite the classrooms and cubicles we are stuffed into. Babies are the model of how we learn—not by passive reaction to the environment but by active testing through observation, hypothesis, experiment, and conclusion. Babies methodically do experiments on objects, for example, to see what they will do. Google takes to heart the power of exploration. For 20 percent of their time, employees may go where their mind asks them to go. The proof is in the bottom line: fully 50 percent of new products, including Gmail and Google News, came from “20 percent time.”","New scientific insights into why our brains work this way, and how to use what we now know to learn or work better."
"You, Inc - The Art of Selling Yourself",Harry Beckwith,0446578215,8,"COMMUNICATING: We assume the first rule of communication is, ""Communicate so that you are understood."" It's not. The first rule is, ""Communicate so that you cannot be misunderstood."" The first 15 words are as important as the next 1500. Give listeners a compelling reason to listen, but without giving away your ending. Like audiences for movies, listeners lose interest in a story when they know its ending. Once you open with a strong lead and provide some detail, you need to jump-start it with the next lead. Reclaim their attention. (""But wait - there's more!"" ""But the best part is what happened next..."") This prompts the audience to rise up and ask, ""Now what?"" Most impressions used to be made face-to-face. Now with email, your communication skills are like your appearance. Clarity becomes more important as time has become more valuable. Ambiguity is expensive. Power comes from the words of the communicator, and the most potent words are those that are expressed succinctly and vividly. Those who can express themselves in words that cannot be misunderstood have more power and more value. Make yourself clearer and people will think you are an expert. All good stories have a hero, and two other key elements: 1. A serious challenge. 2. A hero dealing with the challenge and learning something as a result. But make sure you put the audience, not you, in the hero's shoes. People identify with themselves. They want solutions to their problems. They are interested in making their own lives better. Simplify. What we want is certainty and simplification gives us that. Less options. Constantly edit your story. Find your message, keep it simple, and repeat it often. Whatever you write, read it aloud. Edit. Revise every memo and revise it again. Advance just one strong argument. You cannot say too little. Get your listener's attention first with that one argument, then wait for them to ask more. Don't say ""solutions"". That's plural. People want one. Your friend tells you an unfunny joke. You laugh anyway. That's natural. You're being kind. Same thing happens when you send someone a clever self-promotion, encouraged by the people who laugh out of manners. So you keep trying the gimmick. Same thing happens when you tell a joke in a presentation. False consensus effect: assuming others agree with us when they do not. Many people feel uncomfortable with your implication: that they lack sophistication, are easily fooled, and may even be frivolous. A gimmick also makes it appear that you have nothing important to say, so you are relying on bad puns, word play, and tricks instead. LISTENING AND SPEAKING: When you listen to someone, pause a full second before replying. It signals that you have listened. If you start immediately, it gives the impression you've just been waiting for them to stop, so you could get to the important part : your words, your thoughts. A great presentation must be motivational. A poor teacher describes. A good teacher explains. An excellent teacher demonstrates. A great teacher inspires. Slide presentations with bullet points strip all emotional context. Imagine MLK speech: 1. HAVE A DREAM a. better life b. racial equality c. can see promised land Would Lincoln at Gettysburg have fared better if he had visual aids? You know you gave a great presentation when people say, ""I wish he would have spoken longer."" Leaving a group wanting to hear more, and you have sold something : a second audience with them. RELATING: Top law firm in Minneapolis got to the top because they do something amazing : they say, ""If your problem falls outside our specialty, we'll help you find the best firm for that issue."" Position yourself as the solution to almost everything, and everyone will see you as the solution for nothing. People want specialists. But you can offer something valuable in this age of so many choices, so many people, so many possible solutions : you can be a source. You can be seen as someone who can solve the problem - or find someone who can. Be the person who has just what they need - or knows who does. Get to know all the top people. Be consistent in your hours, habits, and behaviors. We are most comfortable with people whose behavior we can predict. OTHER: Don't think outside the box - (most people can't) - just grow your box. Bring new things in. Tinker with your box. Buy an orange sport coat and red suede shoes. See what changes. Study different cultures. Education does more than prepare us for careers. It enlarges our world - the number of people with whom we can connect. The more you learn, the more people you can engage. Do what you love. The money may follow and please you. The money may follow but pleases you less than you expected. The money may follow but pleases you only briefly. (Maslow said humans are only capable of temporary satisfaction. Once something satifies us, we move on to our next unsatisfied desire.) The money may not follow, which might disappoint you. But if you're doing what you love, you will have loved what you've been doing. That will satisfy you so deeply that the result must either be called success or recognized as something even more enriching. If an idea doesn't make you at least a little uncomfortable, it's not an idea. A little discomfort is a good thing. A lot usually proves to be even better. No one gets out of here alive. There is a term for those who live vitally, with passion and humor : élan. Italians give special praise on people who ignore the weight of life's burdens, and live with its lightness. sprezzatura http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura (roughly translated as nonchalance) Sprezzatura is the signal trait of successful people. Comparing yourself to others is a waste of time. When you see someone else, you only see the part of the iceberg above the water. A financial planner raised his fees by 40%. The first year following that increase, his income increased 65%. Today it's up 150%. A Canadian decorator charged $75/hr for years. Raised her fee to $125/hr, and the effect was immediate. Inquiries increased, from people eager to work with the region's ""premier interior decorator"". Her conversion rates improved. Once prospects believed they were dealing with the area's best decorator - the conclusion they came to from her fee - they were more apt to say, ""When can we start?"" Sales took less time. The fee increase also meant her more affluent clientele paid faster, more willingly, and without fail.","One of my favorite authors, and a massive inspiration for my e-book.

How to Get Rich,Felix Dennis,1591842050,8,"Whatever qualities the rich may have, they can be acquired by anyone with the tenacity to become rich. The key is confidence. Confidence and an unshakable belief it can be done and that you are the one to do it. Tunnel vision helps. Being a bit of a shit helps. A thick skin helps. Stamina is crucial, as is a capacity to work so hard that your best friends mock you, your lovers despair, and the rest of your acquaintances watch furtively from the sidelines, half in awe and half in contempt. Luck helps, but only if you don't seek it. Money is exactly like sex. You think of nothing else if you don't have it, and think of other things if you do. Money is color-blind, race-blind, sex-blind, degree-blind, and couldn't care less who brought you up or in what circumstances. Money is one of the most neutral substances on earth. Others may conspire against you obtaining it through bigotry or prejudice, but they can only succeed if you let them. As a young penniless and inexperienced person, you are not an ""expert"". No track record to defend. Thus you are more willing to learn than those in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. You are not afraid of making mistakes, admitting them when you do, and getting right back on track. Ambition, fearlessness, self-belief, stamina, a degree of callousness, a willingness to learn. These are your advantages over the middle-aged and old. == HARNESSING THE FEAR OF FAILURE Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Employees wanting to do their own new project : I fear them. I fear they may have spotted something we have missed, some gap in the market. I fear their new venture will grow at our expense while it poaches our personnel and our market share. The only way to deal with fear is to cozy up to it. Look it in the eye and pump its hand. Translate its negative energy into adrenaline. To harness it. To laugh with it rather than at it. ""Dare not"" is one thing. ""Cannot"" is another. Not everyone can be rich, but anyone can dare to. Somebody has to. If I had my time again, knowing what I know today, I would dedicate myself to making just enough to live comfortably ($60-$80M) as quickly as I could - by the time I was 35. I would then cash out and retire to write poetry and plant trees. ""Once begun, the job's half-done."" Because that first irrevocable step has proved to be the most difficult part of nearly every venture I've been involved in. No matter how much faculty of idle seeing a man has, the step from knowing to doing is rarely taken. There are so many reasons not to do anything, many of them highly persuasive. Everywhere you look, you find people who appear to take perverse pleasure in pointing out the obvious: that if a new venture does not succeed, it may result in failure. Prompt decisions and orders, right or wrong, are far healthier than endless debate. This applies equally to a debate within one's own mind. Fretting is counterproductive at any level. And so is lack of action. Knowing that fear of failure is holding you back is a step in the right direction. But it isn't enough, because knowing isn't doing. You must grow a mental armor. Not so thick as to blind you to well-constructed criticism and advice, especially from those you trust. Nor so thick as to cut you off from friends and family. But thick enough to shrug off the inevitable sniggering and malicious mockery that will follow your inevitable failures, not to mention the poorly hidden envy that will accompany your eventual success. If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically, you stand very little chance of ever getting rich. If you cannot treat your quest to get rich as a game, you will never be rich. If you cannot face up to your fear of failure, you will never be rich. I am convinced the fear of failing in the eyes of the world is the single biggest impediment to amassing wealth. Trust me on this. == THE SEARCH (what field to go into) Salary begins to have an attraction and addictiveness all of its own. A regular paycheck and crack cocaine have that in common. Working too long for other people can blunt your desire to take risks. The ability to live with and embrace risk is what sets apart the financial winners and losers in the world. Team spirit is for losers, financially speaking. It's the glue that binds losers together. It's the methodology employers use to shackle useful employees to their desks without having to pay them too much. It acts as a subtle handicap and a brake to ambitious individuals. Which, in a way, it's designed to do. Too many people want to make a blockbuster movie and live in Beverly Hills. Not enough people want to dig holes. (Friend of his is incredibly rich digging holes, essentially.) New or rapidly developing industries, whether glamorous or not, very often provide more opportunities to get rich than established sectors. Three reasons for this are availability of risk capital, ignorance, and the power of a rising tide. Investors are drawn to emerging industries in the hope of making a fast buck. To acquire capital you need to be where the loose capital is searching for a home. By the time our bigger rivals were comfortable enough to launch against us, a hesitation resulting from ignorance, the tide had carried us beyond the reach of their big guns. New capital, ignorance, and a rising tide had done the trick. Capitalism demands that whoever takes the most financial risk calls the piper's tune. The biggest rewards go not to those individuals who came up with the idea, nor to those individuals who built the empire. They go to those entities or individuals who funded the enterprise and own the most stock. Your inclinations really do count. You have to pay attention to them. Do not fall into the error of making a fetish of your passion. It is the instict to seize an opportunity when it presents itself that perhaps sets apart the self-made filthy rich from the comfortably poor, the willingness to ignore conventional wisdom and risk everything on what others consider to be folly. ""The harder I practiced, the luckier I got."" Fortune favors not just the brave, but the bold. Boldness has a kind of genius in it. Should boldness succeed, should the chance be seized and sufficiently well executed, then success will surely lead to glory. All around us, every day, opportunities to get rich are popping up. The more alert you are, the more chance you have of spotting them. The more preparation you have done, the more chance you have of succeeding. The more bold you are, the better chance you have of getting in on the ground floor and confounding the odds. The more self-belief you can muster, the more certain will be your aim and your timing. The less you care what the neighbors think, the more likely you are to take the plunge and exploit an opportunity. == THE FALLACY OF THE GREAT IDEA The original is not the greatest. If you want to be rich, watch your rivals closely and never be ashamed to emulate a winning strategy. They may josh you a little for doing it, but that's a price well worth paying. The problem with the great idea is that it concentrates the mind on the idea itself. Unless the idea is executed efficiently, and with panache and originality, then it doesn't matter how great the idea is, the enterprise will fail. If you never have a single great idea in your life, but become skilled at executing the great ideas of others, you can succeed beyond your wildest dreams. Seek them out and make them work. They do not have to be your ideas. Execution is all in this regard. On the other hand, if you spend your days thinking up and developing in your mind this great idea or that, you are unlikely to get rich. Although you are likely to make many others rich. Ideas don't make you rich. The correct execution of ideas does. == OBTAINING CAPITAL Venture capitalists, major investors and bankers all have their part to play in providing capital for individuals and start-up companies. But if it is at all possible, give me the fish over the sharks and dolphins every time. It may take a mite longer to get there, but you'll be far richer, or at very least happier in the long run. == THE FIVE MOST COMMON START-UP ERRORS You can improve cash flow by observing the following suggestions in a start-up's early days: - Keep payroll down to an absolute minimum. Overhead walks on two legs. - Never sign long-term rent agreements or take upmarket office space. - Never buy a business meal if the other side offers to. - Pay yourself just enough to eat. - Issuing staff credit cards, company cell phones, or cars is the road to ruin. - Play one supplier against another, ruthlessly. They want your business. - Only enter a factoring deal in absolute extremity. Exit it fast. Reinforcing failure : the hardest error to avoid in this entire book. Success has a thousand fathers, while failure is famously always an orphan. Success is the ability to go from one failure to another, unrepentant and with no loss of enthusiasm. It is this possibility, the chance that we are onto a slow-burn winner, rather than being stuck with an out-and-out loser, that persuades so many of us to hang in there with a product or service in financial trouble. There is no victory over customers. Thinking big. That's the secret. Of the dozens of indie magazine publishers in Britain in the 1970s, hardly one of them dared to think big enough to get on an airplane and hawk their wares in the biggest market in the world. Those few that did so licensed their magazines, they never thought to create a partnership and risk their own capital. But the corollary of thinking big is to act small. Just because you have a success or two under your belt doesn't mean you have it made. ""Success is never permanent; failure is never fatal. The only thing that really counts is to never, never, never give up."" Once you begin to believe that you are infallilble, that success will automatically lead to more success, and that you have ""got it made"", reality will be sure to give you a rude wake-up call. Believing your own bullshit is never more fatal than for the owner of a start-up venture. By acting small, I mean remaining in touch. Remaining flexible. Most of the worst errors I have made in my life came from forgetting to act small. It's hard to do when you're rolling around in coin and everything is going your way. But acting big leads to complacency and complacency is the reason that many successful start-ups falter. When you come across real talent, it is sometimes worth allowing them to create the structure in which they choose to labor. 90% of the time, by inviting them to take responsibility and control for a new venture, you will motivate them to do great things. What talent seeks, more often than not, is the chance to prove itself and the opportunity to excel. You must identify talent. Then you must move heaven and earth to hire it. You must nurture it, reward it properly, and protect it from being poached. If necessary, dream up a new project. Better still, get the talent to dream it up. Youth is a further factor. By the time talent is in its mid-to-late forties or early fifties, it will have become very very expensive. Young talent can be found and underpaid for a short while, providing the work is challenging enough. Then it will be paid at the market rate. Talent is indispensable, although it is always replaceable. Just remember the simple rules concerning talent : identify it, hire it, nurture it, reward it, protect it. And, when the time comes, fire it. == CARDINAL VIRTUES Stubborness is not persistence. Stubbornness implies that you intend to persist despite plentiful evidence that you should not. A stubborn person fears to be shown that he or she is wrong. A persistent person is convinced that he or she has been right all along, and that the proof lies just around the corner. That with just a little further effort, the veil of failure will be torn away to reveal success. Quitting is not dishonorable. Quitting when you believe you can still succeed, is. I ask that you begin right now right at this very moment to ask yourself whether you believe in yourself. Do you believe in yourself? Do you? Without self-belief, nothing can be accomplished. With it, nothing is impossible. Doubt is a warning system and plays its part in reaching decisions. It's rude and arrogant to invest in a company you intend to bring into your stable without a thorough and honest discussion of pros and cons with senior colleagues. It's not good business, but it is the only business an entrepreneur has the right to be doing. I'm not a manager. I'm not even a businessman. I'm an entrepreneur and I go with my gut. After that, managers and beancounters and financial advisors take over, but only afterwards. If you do not launch the weekly edition, even though you know it's a good idea, then your rivals will do it for you. Let's take another example of building more baskets just as quickly as you can. Richard Branson has done it. Some of his Virgin enterprises are not as strong as others. Western Capitalism will have to sink into an ocean of darkness before all of Richard's Virgin businesses go broke. Richard has perfected one cardinal rule : he owns or part-owns more baskets than anyone else alive. It's certainly one way to become a billionaire. How many baskets should you go for? In the beginning it would be best if you can keep them related to your core business. During the start-up you concentrate on that one basket, as if your life depends on it. But once you have something that's working, start looking around quickly for another opportunity. The more baskets the better. I do not bring to any project the passion and insight of those more closely involved. The biggest basket I ever built wasn't my 1st or 2nd, it was my 20th. But if I wouldn't have built my 2nd, I never would have reached my 20th. I want to be where people can reach me on certain days of the week. Why? Because I want to hear what they have to say. Not because I'm a sociable chap. When you stop listening, you stop learning. And if you stop learning, it's time to get out of the kitchen, and let someone else do the cooking. Listening is the most powerful weapon, after self-belief and persistence, that you can bring into play as an entrepreneur. Talking to your own executives and senior managers is necessary, of course. But talking to people you do not know, or who work in some obscure corner of your industry, or even in your own company, is just as necessary. Moreso, perhaps. If you have experience, a little investment cash, and will make the time, then the world will bring to your door an amazing collection of visionaries, con artists, madmen, and budding entrepreneurs. They all have something to say. Most of your time will be wasted. But what is not wasted will make you richer - much richer. Being courteous and always failing merely makes you a courteous loser. Courtesy is not a cardinal virtue in getting rich, but it helps. My advice, based on thousands of such meetings over the years, is to keep them short. Unless your gut tells you you've stumbled across a winner, set the meeting at 20 minutes. Have someone interrupt you after 25 minutes and have the caller ushered swiftly from your room. It's usually better to leave no doubt in your visitor's mind if you're not interested in their project or idea. In a way, it's kinder, as well. Now let's talk about ideas and who owns what. If someone comes to see you with an idea you're already considering or working on, no matter how loose the connection, then stop them abruptly and tell them the situation. That's only fair. Ideas, by the way, can not be owned by anyone. You can not trademark or patent or copyright any idea. You can only protect the execution of an idea, and trademark the name. This is an important thing to know in any business, and is often misunderstood by people who come to you with an idea. Such people often request you sign an NDA, and I'm usually happy to do so. What if they come up with an idea which the company then develops then proves to be a huge success - who owns it? The company does. You do, if you are the owner of the company, and your employee put forth the idea. If someone came to you with an idea. How far has she gone towards executing this idea? She should not have come to you without protecting that idea very very carefully indeed. However, if she brought out a sample which does not work well, but worked to some degree, the case is altered. She has executed her idea, however badly. If you wish to invest in the idea, you would almost certainly have to come to a legal agreement with the inventor. Listening continuously - listening and learning - is one of the vital components for those of you who wish to be rich. == A FEW WORDS ABOUT LUCK Listen to people who are good with money, and always invest in property with a good address, providing you can pay cash for it, and will not need to sell it for a few years. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Preparation multiplied by opportunity. To become rich, you must behave as a predator. You must become a predator. (about unlucky friend) He weighs options too carefully. He is capable of imagining defeat. So while he is clever enough to want to minimize his risks by switching to yet another new uncontested marketplace, he leads himself into uncertainty and into error. Having too much money isn't important. Breaking your neck is important. Getting cancer is important. Having nothing to eat is important. But too much money is absolutely not important. It's just a part of the game. As H. L. Mencken put it, the chief value of money is that one lives in a world in which it is overestimated. == THE ART OF NEGOTIATING All great companies, all well-run organizations, need great managers and great staff. The acquisition of managers who can bring a sense of mission to even mundane tasks, who can identify potential candidates, nurture late-bloomers, fire dullards and whiners, and adapt to changing circumstances. That is not about negotiating. You may well have to masquerade as a manager for a short while on the way to becoming rich. And you should strive to be a good manager while the role is forced upon you. But even if you discover you truly have a talent for the minutea, the management demands, it's best to abandon the role just as soon as you can afford to hire the appropriate personnel. The world is full of aspiring lieutenants. Most people seek job security, job satisfaction, and power over others, far more than they seek wealth. Management efficiency really does count, of course. Loyalty counts. Fairness counts. A steady disposition counts. A sense of appropriate compromise counts. An organization will fail without managers who apply such virtues consistently. (About your enemy:) The first thing to be done, the most vital thing, is to establish exactly where those weaknesses lie. An immediate balance of weakness may well prove more decisive than any long-term balance of strengths. The elephant and the flea : the elephant must show his master that he is an up-to-date elephant, a savvy elephant, and elephant that knows what's just around the corner, and what the next big thing is going to be in his patch of jungle. Otherwise he risks his share price dropping and being hurt by the nasty iron stick, or even shot by the fierce institutional investor, who will then acquire a new elephant. A few tips on negotiating: * - If you're a poor negotiator, then set a limit on what you will pay or accept, and on any conditions attached. Do not deviate. Your first thought is your best thought. * - Most negotiations are unnecessary. Don't enter into them. * - Do your homework. What you don't know or haven't bothered to find out can kill you in any serious type of negotiation. * - Get all of the professional help you can trust. Do not surrender control of negotiations or the agenda to such professionals. They are not the one who will have to live with the consequenses. You are. * - If your advisors are leading you down a path you don't approve of, call a time-out and tell them privately that if they continue along that route you will get new advisors. * - They're not your friend. They're your enemy. If you do not understand that real winners and real losers emerge from real negotiations, then you'll be robbed, whatever the circumstances. * - Listen, when engaged in serious negotiations. You are in no hurry. Nobody ever got poor listening. Use silence as a weapon. * - Choose a rogue element to your advantage, and bring it into the negotiation at a late stage. * - Divide and rule always works. * - Permit no such weaknesses in your own camp. == OWNERSHIP! OWNERSHIP! OWNERSHIP! We pretend that mere names can own things. But what is a partnership, a corporation, or a country, but a name? It's easy to be philsophical when you've already amassed a fortune. There's some truth in that, but there's also truth in the assertion that I may well have only been able to put a few hundred million dollars in the bank because I recognized that this getting rich malarkey is just a game. Being rich is fine, and at very least is better than being poor. But it shouldn't be the be-all end-all of your life or anyone's life. If you can laugh in the midst of early poverty and in the face of real adversity, and if you can still laugh while you're coining it in, then you will almost certainly continue to coin it in. To become rich, you must be an owner, and you must try to own it all. You must strive with every fiber of your being, while recognizing the idiocy of your behavior. To own and retain control of as near to 100% of any company as you can. Never never never hand over a single share of anything you've created or acquired, if you can help it. Nothing. Not one share, to no one, no matter what the reason, unless you genuinely have to. Ownership is the only thing that counts. Why doth treason never prosper? For shouldest thou fail, thou must hang. And if it doth succeed, why 'twas never treason! Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done and let them howl. The partnership held, and has always reflected two principles as far as sharing the pie : (1) who is putting what capital into a venture? (2) who is putting what work on that venture? That's the best part of a true partnership: you always have a brother to help carry the load, and if things go wrong, you have a built-in drinking buddy with whom to drown your sorrows. Despite our close friendship and real affection for each other, this knowledge that any one of us could walk away from the others if he wished, that illusion of freedom made it possible to compromise with each other when things got tough in our partnership business. If our partnership had been the only hope I had of making any real money, it might have disintegrated before it began. A partnership is not a marriage. In a marriage you should be willing to die or kill or share everything. In a partnership, money comes first. Establish yourself first, retaining as much control of any startup or acquisition as you can. Only then, seek pastures new with partners in the picture. Ownership buys you the luxury of time. Not only the luxury of occasionally considering a partnership or an investment elsewhere. Ownership means never having to waste time saying sorry that a business didn't work out. It means not having to spend weeks and weeks trying to persuade your partners that a certain course of action is necessary. It means that you can concentrate on building the business and making money - or losing it without the added burden of guilt. Time is the only thing we cannot replace, apart from our health and our lives. I resent wasting a moment of it. == THE JOYS OF DELEGATION How much would Howard Stern earn if he delegated his show to others? After a short while, he would get nothing. His audience would not put up with a substitute. Actors, celebreties, kings, politicians, artists, either do the job in person or they lose the job and the income that comes with the job. If you own a company and that company's purpose is to make you wealthy, you will be content, delighted even, for any amount of glory to go to anyone who works there, providing you get the money. If you do not own the company or part of it then it's possible you are only a senior manager because you like power. Bossy people and glory hounds are mostly interested in building a power base so they can have yet more people to boss about. The devil can quote scripture for his own purpose. The whole point about getting rich is not to have to deal with this nonsense of office politics. True delegation can often be a joy to be involved in on both sides. As an owner you must always be alert of the tell-tale signs that here is a candidate for promotion and delegation. They are smart, smarter than you are, they work hard and appear to love the work they do. They ask intelligent questions and don't waste time gossiping and mucking about. They listen and correct their errors and don't repeat them. They want your job. Especially in the early days of your company, delegation and promotion are among your most powerful weapons in getting rich. Almost everyone wishes to be respected. With promotion comes respect. With delegation comes promotion. If your company is young and a bit rickety, meritocracy, delegation and promotion are the bricks and mortar that will make it stronger. By setting an example early on with a program of carefully tailored delegation and well-deserved promotion, you will create an atmosphere of loyalty, efficiency and comradery that feeds upon itself. An atmosphere poisonous to toads. Good morale, a pervasive feeling of ""us against the world"", combined with the promise of responsible delegation, and promotion based on achievement can move mountains The work undertaken by your colleagues and employees is more important than your work. Your job is to lead. Hard work never bothers the young. They think they are built of steel. What else do I delegate? Almost everything now. I do not run my companies and have not done so in many many years. Meetings : Verbatim minutes are taken. I read all of the minutes of these meetings very carefully and I can get a mite cross if they are not produced promptly and accurately. For me they are not a memorandum of past events. They are a tool to understanding current positions. I also have my personal financial manager as well as my group CFO placed on all these boards. If I'm not present you can be sure he is. Without my express permission: 1. they may not vote anyone on or off the board 2. they may not physically move the headquarters of the company 3. they may not dispose of or shut down any substantial asset 4. they may not purchase or launch any substantial new product or business 5. they may not award themselves bonuses or salary increases Within these guidelines, the managers of my companies are free to get on with their jobs, grow the business, and reach the margin return agreed-upon at the beginning of the year. A margin they will have arrived at, amongst themselves, by consensus with my CFO's eyes on them while they do it. If things go wrong in a particular part of the business then I will get involved. When we are about to launch, sell, or close something - then I'm always involved. Absentee landlords never prosper. One thing I do to compensate for the style of ownership is to look hard for signs of excellent work. When I spot it, I drop a handwritten note to whoever is responsible. Most of all, because I learned to delegate a long time ago, and to accept that you must allow young managers the opportunity to make mistakes without crushing or blaming them when thing go wrong, (you can always fire them if they make the same error over & over). == PIECE OF THE PIE Craft bonuses for those who work for you to achieve margin, cost, and revenue targets. You won't get far if you attempt to financially ""incentivize"" the salt of the earth. (The types that just enjoy working hard.) Praise, the ability to discern when a good job has been done, and the courtesy to say so, fairness, integrity, and camraderie should be employed instead. It takes more trouble than mere bribery, but it produces wonderful results. Always ensure that you want to fight and ought to fight on a larger competitor's ground. If he is anxious to buy you, determined to park his tanks on your ground, maybe you should let him - for the right price. If your competitor is smaller, try to hire him or buy him or join with him. If he won't budge, take drastic action and smash him. If that won't work, then learn to be friends and collude against the wolly mammoths together. Ways to make more pie: - Make annual bonuses generous - ""ring fence"" investment costs from ongoing business : investment money for new projects taken out of ongoing business as a real expense - never delegate bonus arrangements. - at senior level, insist on collective responsibility for bonuses - praise excellent work - fire poor workers mercilessly - turn a cold eye to company perks - avoid all ""jollies"" : trips to Hawaii - set an example : don't waste company money - have senior managers go over annual results with you one-on-one : their comments can be priceless - back up your managers - seek out and promote talent - interview your rivals' talent - discourage secrecy - save a little bit of pie for suppliers - never bad-mouth rivals - sell early (real money rarely comes from horsing around running an asset-laden business if you're an entrepreneur. you're not a manager, remember? whenever the chance comes to sell an asset at the top of its value, do so. things do not keep increasing in value forever. get out while the going is good and move on to the next venture.) - enjoy the business of making money == THE POWER OF FOCUS Look carefully around you at the prevailing industries where wealth appears to be gravitating - then go where the money is! Few fortunes are made in mature industries, unless you are lucky enough to create a monopoly in one. What business should I have gravitated toward? Software, technology, internet startups, cable and satellite TV, property, environmental waste clean-up, alternative energy sources. Do I know anything about these industries? No. But then I didn't know anything about magazines in 1967, either. Stupid people are easy to hire. The world is full of stupid people. Many are extremely pleasant but will not add to your wealth. Avoid them like the plague. What you need are clever, cunning, and adept people. Providing you can pay much cleverer but risk-averse people properly, and promote them and lead them in such a way that they are all rowing in the same direction, they will sign on to your little ship. Persuading them to join is not the problem, but separating the wheat from the chaff is harder. They look so much alike. This is where you have to focus your energy and concentration. Choosing human capital: 1. Never choose an important employee or a key supplier alone. Get others to interview them or talk to them as well, either with you or separately. The final choice must be yours alone. 2. Go further than reading a person's references. It's such a pain, but it pays. Make an appointment with their last company or with a supplier's other customers. Go and see someone there. Get chatty. Listen hard. You will discover more about the person or supplier in a few minutes in this way than in hours of conversation with them. 3. Make notes. Speak little. Have a series of questions ready to shoot out when they grind to a halt. Focus like mad on what your instict is telling you. You are being interviewed, too, so best to keep your mouth shut. 4. Good suppliers respect attention to detail. 5. Pay employees well. Bonuses better. 8. Ignore your prejudices. 10. Don't leave senior employees in any job too long. You will get the most out of any senior employee in their first year or two in a new position. After that, they enter a comfort zone. == WHOOPS! A failure in the offing represents one of the only times that minority shareholders become a potential boon. If you can off-load your share of a failing company on them and shimmy out the door, then you should do so. They may be prepared to take over and attempt themselves to make a success from your failure. Before you dump your dream into the gutter, ensure you do the rounds of other companies in your neck of the woods. It only takes two of them to become interested and you have the chance of getting an auction going. == RECAP FOR IDLERS You have to cut loose to get rich. There isn't any other way. You must cut yourself loose from naysayers and negative influences. They drain confidence and optimism from you. Often including your parents, lover, husband, or wife, and friends. They fear you're placing yourself in harm's way - and to them that's not a good thing. They fear that if you should succeed, you will expose their own timidity to the light of day. You must cut loose in your mind from your previous life. Getting rich comes from an attitude of mind. It isn't going to happen if things drift on pretty much the way they are right now. The world is full of money. Some of it has my name on it. All I have to do is collect it. I have about a hundred good ideas every day. You have to choose a new mine where you suspect there is money, or an old mine with a different angle to get rich. The right mountain. A great new mine right now is in telecommunications, or the internet, or legalized gambling. Property is always good. (You can start small in property and get lucky quickly. It's a crowded market, though, for that very reason.) Go for what attracts you. Go for something that exploits your natural talents. Try for just a single day, a whole day when you refuse to acknowledge fear of failure, fear of making yourself look like an idiot, fear of losing your lover, fear of anything and of any kind. Fear will creep back, but laugh at it and tell it to take a hike. Go on. I dare you. If you can do it, this will transform your life. You will instantly perceive (among many other things) just how much money there is in the world, and how pitifully easy it is to obtain it. Money that already has your name on it. It is fear that rules us. Love and respect and other such emotions make it bearable, at a price. Watch out for blowhards. There are a lot of them out there and they are very negative influences. They can stop you from getting started, from getting going, from taking a massive running leap into the dark. Always remember that they want you to fail, just as they did. Ignore them. == HOW TO STAY RICH The faster you give it away, the more money will flow back to you. Not because of ""karma"", but because you then spend less time defending it and more time making more of it. Never loan it to friends. You will lose your friend as well as your money. Give, but don't loan. Broadcast your policy loudly. If you do not begin to isolate yourself pronto when you get rich, then you will be driven mad pretty swiftly. Don't develop plate-glass vision. Talk with random strangers. The professionals who run your private wealth for you must be the classiest. There is no substitute for a first-class lawyer, tax advisor, accountant, auditor, estate manager, and business advisor. None. Install good accounting systems the second you can afford it. Never stop looking for talent and promoting talent. More entrepreneurs get themselves into trobule by overreaching than exercising discipline. Lead. Do not be led. You have employed smart people. Great. But you are their leader. If you sniff an opportunity, get them to consider it. If they still don't get excited, take the project into your private office and begin it there. Do not leave the opportunity within the company to be sabotaged, focus-grouped and committeed to death. If you're bored with a business, sell it. Try to sell before you have to. Try to sell them before their peak. Buyers require ""blue sky"" (further growth) to get excited and offer a great price. Retirement will kill you. Deliberately employ men and women who are smarter than you - and listen to them.",Shockingly honest thoughts from a filthy rich bastard.
The Innovator's Solution,Clayton Christensen,1578518520,8,"BOOK SUMMARY : Starting with a cost structure in which attractive profits can be earned at low price points and which can be carried up-market Being in a disruptive position relative to competitors so that they are motivated to flee rather than fight Starting with a set of customers who had been nonconsumers so that they are pleased with modest products Targeting a job that customers are trying to get done Skating to where the money will be, not to where it was Assigning managers who have taken the right courses in the school of experience and putting them to work within processes and organizational values that are attuned to what needs to be done Having the flexibility to respond as a viable strategy emerges Starting with capital that can be patient for growth CHAPTER 2 : HOW CAN WE BEAT OUR MOST POWERFUL COMPETITORS? The Innovators Dilemma identified two distinct categories - sustaining and disruptive - based on the circumstances of innovation. In sustaining circumstances - when the race entails making better products that can be sold for more money to attractive customers - we found that incumbents almost always prevail. In disruptive circumstances - when the challenge is to commercialize a simpler more convenient product for less money and appeals to a new or unattractive customer set - the entrants are likely to beat the incumbents. This is the phenomenon that so frequently defeats successful companies. It implies that the best way for upstarts to attack established competitors is to disrupt them. A sustaining innovation targets demanding high-end customers with better performance than what was previously available. Sometimes incremental improvements. Sometimes breakthrough leapfrog-over-competition. But the established competitors almost always win the battles of sustaining technology. Disruptive innovations introduce products and services that are not as good as currently available products. Other benefits, though : simpler, more convenient, less expensive - that appeal to new or less-demanding customers. Once the disruptive product gains a foothold in new or low-end markets, the improvement cycle begins. Because of the pace of technology is faster than customers' ability to use it, the previously not-good-enough technology improves enough to intersect with the path of the more demanding customers. Disrupting has a paralyzing effect on industry leaders. They are always motivated to go up-market, almost never motivated to defend the new or low-end markets that the disruptors find attractive. Leaders are so much easier to beat if the idea for a new product or business is shaped into a disruption. Shaping a business idea into a disruption is an effective strategy for beating an established competitor. It's much easier to beat competitors when they are motivated to flee rather than fight. Sustaining innovations are so attractive and important that the best sustaining companies systematically ignore disruptive threats and opportunities until the game is over. Entrepreneurs who have entered on a sustaining trajectory should turn around and sell out to one of the industry leaders behind them. If executed succesfully, getting ahead of the leaders on the sustaining curve and then selling quickly can be a straightforward way to make an attractive financial return. If you create and attempt to sell a better product into an established market to capture established competitors' best customers, the competitors will be motivated to fight rather than flee. If your idea might represent a sustaining improvement for others, then you should go back to the drawing board. You need to define an opportunity that is disruptive relative to ALL the established players. When a company tries to take a higher-cost business model down-market to sell products at lower price points, almost none of the incremental revenue will fall to its bottom line. Established firms that hope to capture the growth created by disruption need to do so from within an autonomous business with a cost structure that offers as much headroom as possible for subsequent profitable migration up-market. To create a new-growth business : target products and markets that the established companies are motivated to ignore or run away from. New customers who previously lacked the money or skills to buy and use the product. Enable a whole new population of people to begin owning and using the product. Low-end disruptions attack the least-profitable and most overserved customers. Incumbent leaders feel no pain and little threat until the disruption is in its final stages. When disruptors begin pulling customers out of the low end, it actually feels good to the leading firms. Wal-mart : Customers were overserved, did not need well-trained floor salespeople to help them get what they needed. Acceptable profit through a different formula. Many disruptions : Southwest Airlines appealed to people who couldn't afford to fly, and those that were overserved by other airlines. == ** SHAPING IDEAS TO BECOME DISRUPTIVE: THREE LITMUS TESTS: Ideas that get shaped into sustaining innovations could just as easily be shaped into disruptive business plans, with far greater growth potential. Execs must answer three sets of questions, to determine whether an idea has disruptive potential. #1 - CAN IT BE A NEW-MARKET DISRUPTION? Are there lots of people who have not had the money, equipment or skill to do this for themselves, and have gone without it altogether, or have needed to pay someone with more expertise to do it for them? To use the product or service, do customers need to go to an inconvenient centralized location? #2 - CAN IT BE A LOW-END DISRUPTION? Are there customers at the low-end of the market who would be happy to purchase a product with less, but good enough, performance if they could get it at a lower price? Can we create a business model that enables us to earn attractive profits at the discount prices required to win the business of these overserved customers at the low end? #3 - DOES IT DISRUPT ALL? Is the innovation disruptive to *all* of the significant incumbent firms? If it appears to be sustaining to one ore more significant players, the odds will be stacked in that firm's favor, and entrant is unlikely to win. == Disruption is a theory : a conceptual model of cause and effect that makes it possible to better predict the outcomes of competitive battles in different circumstances. These forces almost always topple industry leaders when an attacker has harnessed them because disruptive strategies are predicated on competitors doing what is in their best and most urgent interest : satisfying their most important customers and investing where profits are most attractive. In a profit-seeking world, this is a safe bet. CHAPTER 3 : WHAT PRODUCTS WILL CUSTOMERS WANT TO BUY? Customers ""hire"" products to do specific ""jobs"". Segmenting markets according to the jobs the customers are trying to get done addresses other important marketing challenges such as brand management. Customers - people and companies - have ""jobs"" that arise regularly and need to get done. When customers become aware of a job that they need to get done in their lives, they look around for a product or service that they can ""hire"" to get the job done. Effectively, conveniently, inexpensively as possible. CHAPTER 4 : WHO ARE THE BEST CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS? Successful innovations will emerge from companies who carve disruptive footholds by targeting nonconsumption and moving up-market with better products only after they have started simple and small. #1 - The target customers are trying to get a job done, but because they lack the money or skill, a simple inexpensive solution has been beyond reach. #2 - These customers will compare the disruptive product to having nothing at all. As a result, they are delighted to buy it even though it may not be as good as other products available at high prices to current users with deeper expertise in the original value network. The performance hurdle required to delight such new-market customers is quite modest. #3 - The technology that enables the disruption might be quite sophisticated, but disruptors deploy it to make the purchase and use of the product simple, convenient, and foolproof. It's this foolproof aspect that creates new growth by enabling people with less money and training to begin consuming. #4 - The disruptive innovation creates a whole new value network. The new consumers typically purchase the product through new channels and use the product in new venues. Established competitors view the entrants into the emerging network as irrelevant. Incumbents have the wrong response : they invest massive sums trying to advance the technology enough to please the customers in the existing value network. If you frame a phenomenon as a threat, it gets a more intense and energetic response than if you frame it as an opportunity. Response to threat is ""threat rigidity"" : you cease being flexible, become ""command and control"" oriented, and focus everything on countering the threat in order to survive. Best way to use this to your advantage in corporate land : Get top-level commitment by framing something as a threat, then shift responsibility to an autonomous organization that can frame it as an opportunity. It is foolish to give salespeople a financial incentive to push disruptive products. Disruptive products require disruptive channels. CHAPTER 5 : GETTING THE SCOPE OF THE BUSINESS RIGHT The problem with making decisions based on your core competence : What might seem to be a noncore activity today might become an absolutely critical competence to have mastered in a proprietary way in the future, and vice-versa. IBM, for example : in the process of outsourcing what it didn't feel was its core (the O.S. and the CPU) : it put into business two companies (Microsoft and Intel) that captured a majority of the profits for years. Instead of asking what their company does best today, managers should ask, ""What do we need to master today, and what will we need to master in the future, in order to excel on the trajectory of improvement that customers will define as important?"" The standardization inherent in modularity takes too many degress of design freedom away from engineers. One sign that the functionality and reliability of a product have become too good is that employees say, ""Why can't they see that our product is better than the competition? They're treating it like a commodity!"" This is evidence of overshooting. Modular architectures help companies to compete on the dimensions that matter in the lower right portions of the disruption diagram. Companies can introduce new products faster because they can upgrade individual subsystems without having to redesign everything. In a modular world, you can prosper by outsourcing or by supplying just one element. Customers become less and less willing to reward further improvements in functionality and reliability with premium prices. People cannot efficiently resolve interdependent problems while working at arm's length across organizational boundary. CHAPTER 6 : HOW TO AVOID COMMODITIZATION Commoditization : whenever it is at work somewhere in a value chain, a reciprocal process of DE-commoditizatoion is at work somewhere else in the value chain. De-commoditization affords opportunities : the locus of the ability to differentiate shifts continuously in a value chain. Companies who position themselves at a spot in the value chain where performance is not yet good enough will capture the profit. Wayne Gretzky slogan : don't go where the money presently is, but to where the money will be. Companies that are the most successful are integrated companies that design and assemble the not-good-enough end-use products. Making highly differentiable products with strong cost advantages is a license to print money. Customers will not pay still-higher prices for products they already deem too good. Before long, modularity rules, and commoditization sets in. When the relevant dimensions of your product's performance are determined not by you but by the subsystems, it becomes difficult to earn anything more than substinence returns. When your world becomes modular, you'll need to look elsewhere in the value chain to make any serious money. A company that finds itself in a more-than-good-enough circumstance can't win. Either disruption will steal its markets or commoditiziation will steal its profits. De-commodoitization occurs in places where attractive profits were hard to attain in the past : in the formerly modular and undifferentiable processes, components or subsystems. Modular disruptors should carry their low-cost business models up-market as fast as possible, to keep competing at the margin against higher-cost markers of proprietary products. Find the best performance-defining components and subsystems, incorporating them in their products faster than anyone else. Profit accumulated where products that were not yet good enough. Architectures therefore tended to be interdependent and proprietary. What makes an industry appear to be attractively profitable is the circumstance in which its companies happen to be at a particular point in time. IBM hard drives : skate to where the money would be, by using modularity to decouple its head and disk operations from its disk drive design and assembly business. Sell its most advanced heads and disks to competing 2.5"" drive makers, it could de-emphasize the assembly of drives and focus on the more profitable head and disk. On the more-than-good-enough side, a better strategy is to sell bullets to the combatants. It didn't occur to the company's management that the activities they were outsourcing weren't the other company's core competencies, either! Whether or not something is a core competence is not the determining factor of who can skate to where the money will be. For many suppliers, eating their way up the value chain creates opportunities to design subsystems with increasingly optimized internal architectures that become key performance drivers of the modular products that its customers assemble. Core competence, as it is used by many managers, is a dangerously inward-looking notion. Competitiveness is far more about doing what customers value than doing what you think you're good at. Staying competitive as the basis of competition shifts necessarily requires a willingness and ability to learn new things rather than clinging hopefully to the past sources of glory. The challenge for incumbent companies is to rebuild their ships while at sea. Knowing this is going to happen gives managers the opportunity to own or acquire and manage as separate growth-oriented businesses, the component or subsystem suppliers that are positioned to eat their way up the value chain. This is the essense of skating to where the money will be. Brands are most valuable where things aren't yet good enough. When customers aren't yet certain whether a product's performance will be satisfactory. A well-crafted brand can step in and close the gap between what customers need and what they fear they might get if they buy the product from a supplier of unknown reptuation. Good brands get price premium. The ability of brands to command premium prices dissolves when the performance of a class of products from multiple suppliers is manifestly more than adequate. Performance-defining subsystems within the product, or at the retail interface when it is the speed, simplicity, and convenience of getting exactly what you want that is not good enough. The power to capture attractive profits will shift to those activities in the value chain where the immediate customer is not yet satisfied with the performance of available products. The customer interface is the place in the value chain where the ability to excel on this new dimension of competition is determined. Companies that are integrated in a proprietary way across the interface to the customer can compete on these not-good-enough dimensions more effectively. CHAPTER 7 : IS YOUR ORGANIZATION CAPABLE OF DISRUPTIVE GROWTH? Three classes or sets of factors that define what an organization can and can not accomplish: RPV (1) - resources (2) - processes (3) - values Innumerable failed efforts - primarily caused by the wrong people chosen to lead the venture. Right-stuff thinking (""this guy has the right stuff!"") gets the categories wrong. You encounter very different problems in starting up a new venture than in running a well-tuned one. Failure and bouncing back from failure can be critical courses in the school of experience. Look for people willing and able to learn, doing things wrong and recovering from mistakes. First step : predict the problems, challenges, situations that this new venture will be in. (A set of forseeable problems.) From this, list the ""courses"" (lessons) you would want the team of managers of the new venture to have already learned. Experiences through which they would have developed the intuition and skill to understand and manage this set of forseeable problems. This list of experiences should constitute a ""hiring specification"" for the senior management team. Rather than specifying a set of right-stuff attributes, specify the circumstances in which the new team will be asked to manage. Example: ""we would want a CEO who in the past had launched a venture thinking he/she had the right strategy, realized it wasn't working, then iterated towards a strategy that did work. We'd want a marketing exec who had insightfully figured out how a just-emerging market was structured, had helped to shape a new product and service package that did an important job well for customers who had been nonconsumers."" etc Organizations create value as employees transform inputs of resources (the work of people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, energy, and cash) into products and services of greater worth. The patterns through which they make these transformations are called processes. Whether they are formal, informal, or cultural, processes define how an organization transforms inputs into things of greater value. When the same, seemingly efficient process is employed to tackle a very different task, it often seems bureaucratic and inefficient. Innovating managers often try to start new-growth businesses using processes that were designed to make the mainstream business run effectively. They succumb to this temptation because the new game begins before the old game ends. It seems simpler to have a one-size-fits-all process for doing things, but VERY often the cause of a new venture's failure is that the wrong processes were used to build it. Tough to judge whether the mainstream organization's processes will facilitate or impede a new-growth business. Ask whether the organization has faced simliar situations or tasks in the past. If that organization has not repeatedly formulated plans for competing in markets that do not yet exist, it's safe to assume no processes for making such plans exist. Values are the standards by which employees make prioritization decisions : whether an order is attractive, whether a particular customer is more important, which customers they will call on. It's important for senior managers to train employees at every level to make prioritization decisions that are consistent with the strategic direction and business model of the company. Successful senior executives that spend so much time articulating clear, consistent values that are broadly understood throughout the organization. Resources and processes are often enablers that define what an organization can do. Values often represent restraints : they define what an organization cannot do. As companies upgrade, they often add overhead cost. Gross margins will seem unattractive at a later point. As companies become large, they literally lose the capability to enter small emerging markets. Huge size makes a disability in creating new-growth businesses. In the start-up stages, much of what gets done is attributable to its resources, that is : its people. Over time, the capabilities will shift towards processes and values. When hot young companies flame-out, The founding team fails to institute the processes or values that came help the company follow-up with a sequence of hot new products. As a new company's processes and values are coalescing, the actions and attitudes of the company's founder typically have a profound impact. As successful companies mature, employees gradually come to assume that the priorities they have learned to accept, the ways of doing things, are the right way to work. Once members of the organization begin to adopt ways of working and criteria for making decisions by assumption, rather than conscious decision, those processes and values come to constitute the organization's culture. Culture is powerful management tool. When organization's capabilities lies many in people, changing to address new problems is simple. When they have become embedded in a culture, change can become extraordinarily difficult. Disruptive innovations occur so intermittently that no company has a practiced process for handling them. Disruptions are inconsistent with the leading companies' values. Established companies have the resources (people, money, technology) required to succeed at disruptive, but their processes and values are disabilities in their efforts to succeed at disruptive innovation. Ensure that responsibility for making the venture successful is given to an organization whose processes will facilitate what needs to be done and whose values and prioritize those activities. If execs can stop using one-process- and one-organization-fits-all policies for all types of growth innovations, they can greatly improve the probabilities that their growth ventures will succeed. What is disruptive to one company might have a sustaining impact on another. Organizations cannot disrupt themselves. If innovations are developed within the mainstream organization, the processes and values ensure that it can only implement sustaining innovations. Processes and values can also be made or bought. Identify managers who are able, here and now, to grapple succesfully with the challenges of building a new business. To develop managers for the future, organizations need to put up-and-coming managers into situations and responsibilities for which they are not yet qualified! It is the only way they can learn the skills required to succeed. You need to be creating successful businesses in order to have the right curriculum within your internal schools of experience in which next-gen managers can learn. Yet having capable managers in place is a prerequisite to building these growth businesses. Successfully wrestling with these dimensions if the innovator's dilemma is a critical responsibility of a director of human resources. Potential should not be measured by attributes, but rather by the ability to acquire the attributes and skills needed : the ability to learn. Avoid the trap of assuming that the finite list of competencies important for today are those that will be required in the future. Look for ""seeks opportunities to learn"", ""seeks and uses feedback"", ""asks the right questions"", ""looks at things from new perspectives"", ""learns from mistakes"". Those who are ""ready now"" are, by definition, the ones that have the least to learn by doing it. A company that works to develop a sequence of new-growth businesses can build a virtuous cycle in management development. Launching growth businesses creates a set of rigorous demanding schools in which next-gen execs can learn how to lead disruption. Companies that only sporadically attempt to create new-growth businesses, in contrast, offer to their next-gen execs precious few of the courses they need to successfully sustain growth. When there is a well-defined interface between the activities of two different people or groups - meaning that you can clearly specifiy what each is supposed to deliver, you can measure and verify what they deliver, and there are no unanticipated interdependencies between what one does and what the other must do in response - then those people and groups can interface at arm's length and need not be on the same team. The reason an organization cannot disrupt itself is that successful organizations can only naturally prioritize innovations that promise improved profit margins relative to their current cost structure. For Schwab, for example, it was far more straightforward to create a new business model that could view $29 as a profitable proposition than it would have been to hack enough cost out of the original organization so that it could make money at the disruptive price point. This is the best way to change values, because the new disruptive game almost always must begin while the established business still has substantial profitable sustaining potential. The disruptive business needs to have the freedom to create new processes. Judgement calls are a key role of the CEO. Every time one company buys another, it buys its resources, processes, and values. CHAPTER EIGHT : MANAGING THE STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS Though execs are obsessed with finding the right strategy, they can wield greater leverage by managing the process used to develop the strategy. Deliberate strategies are the appropriate tool for organizing actions if three conditions are met: (1) - the strategy must encompass and address correctly all of the important details required to succeed, and those responsible for implementation must understand each important detail in management's deliberate strategy. (2) - if the organization is to take collective action, the strategy needs to make as much sense to all employees as they view the world from their own context as it does to top management, so they will act appropriately and consistently. (3) - the collective intentions must be realized with little unanticipated influence from outside political, technological, or market forces. Because it is so difficult to find a situation in which all three of these conditions apply, the emergent strategy-making process almost always alters the strategy that the company actually implements. Emergent strategy bubbles up from within the organization - the cumulative effect of day-to-day prioritization and investment decisions. Tactical, day-to-day operation decisions made by people who are not in a visionary, futuristic or strategic state of mind. EXAMPLES: Sam Walton's decision to build the 2nd Wal-Mart in another small town near his first one was just for logistical and managerial efficiency. Intel had ""top performing gets top priority"" process at the bottom ranks, and this process alone moved them from RAM into CPUs, without top execs hardly even noticing. (""Senior management recognized that Intel had become a microprocessor company"") Intel's remarkable strategy shift was not the result of an intended strategy articulated within the executive ranks. Rather it emerged through the daily decisions made by middle managers as they allocated resources. Most of the ideas for developing new products, services, businesses bubble up from employees within the organization. Emergent processes should dominate in circumstances in which the future is hard to read and in which it is not clear what the right strategy should be. This is almost always the case during the early phases of a company's life. In 90% of all successful new businesses, the strategy that the founders had deliberately decided to pursue was not the strategy that ultimately led to the business's success. Entrepreneurs rarely get their strategies right the first time. The successful ones make it because they have money left over to try again after they learn their initial strategy was flawed, whereas the failed ones typically have spent their resources implementing a deliberate strategy before its viability could be known. Learn from emergent sources what is working and what is not, then learn to cycle that learning back into the process through the deliberate channel. Act before everything is fully understood. Respond to an evolving reality rather than having to focus on a stable fantasy. Learning what works. Failure often comes from implementing a deliberate strategy in the early stages when the right strategy cannot be known. Efforts to catch new waves of disruptive growth need to be guided through emergent processes. The mainstream business needs to be guided by deliberate strategy. Many companies' execs perceived the need to allocate resources to disruptive growth before it's too late, but very rarely are they able to consistently manage the strategy development process appropriately across a range of businesses in various stages of maturity. After they have entered a deliberate strategy mode, they find it very difficult to let new businesses be guided through an emergent process. EXAMPLE: Prodigy in 1992 noticed that their 2 million subscribers were spending more time on email than web. They had planned on being a web company so they started charging extra fees for sending more than 30 emails per month! Rather than seeing email as an emergent strategy signal, the company tried to filter it out, because in deliberate mode, management's job was to implement the original strategy. EXAMPLE: Handheld computers. Apple Newton, HP. All failed. Palm, who made the O.S., succeeed. What was the mistake? The computer companies employed deliberate strategy processes from beginning to end. Invested massively to implement their strategies, then wrote the projects off when the strategies proved wrong. Palm was the only one that shifted to an emergent strategy process when its original delibrate strategy failed. When a viable strategy emerged, Palm shifted back to a deliberate process as it migrated up-market. Managers must: (1) - Carefully control the initial cost structure of a new-growth business because this will quickly determine the values that will drive the critical resource allocation decisions in that business. (2) - Actively accelerate the process by which a viable strategy emerges by ensuring that business plans are designed to test and confirm critical assumptions using tools such as discovery-driven planning. (3) - Personally and repeatedly intervene, business by business, exercising judgement about whether the circumstance is such that the business needs to follow an emergent or deliberate strategy-making process. CEOs must not leave the choice about strategy process to policy, habit, or culture. Execs need to pay careful attention to getting the initial conditions right. New ventures need a cost structure that makes small customers and products financially attractive. Enthusiastically pursue the small orders. DELIBERATE planning (TRADITIONAL / for existing-sustaining): (1) - make assumptions about the future (2) - make a strategy based on those assumptions & build financial projections based on that strategy (3) - make decisions to invest based on those financial projections (4) - implement the strategy in order to achieve projected financial results DISCOVERY-DRIVEN PLANNING: (for disruptions) (1) - make the targeted financial projections (2) - what assumptions must prove true in order for these projections to materialize? (3) - implement a plan to learn - to test whether the critical assumptions are reasonable (4) - invest to implement the strategy note #3 : a plan to test the validity of the most important assumptions. This plan needs to generate quickly, with as little expense as possible, validating or invalidating information about the most critical assumptions. The resource allocation process can get sticky, which is why the CEO needs to keep their hands on the control constantly and consciously. When a viable strategy has emerged and it's time for execution, the CEO needs to aggressively switch to a deliberate strategy mode and stop funding emergent opportunities that might divert the company from its focus on the winning plan. CHAPTER TEN : THE ROLE OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN LEADING NEW GROWTH Create a Disruptive Growth Engine : which capably and repeatedly launches successful growth businesses. Sense when the circumstances are changing, and keep teaching others how to recognize these signals. One problem with the ""send the big decisions to the big people"" theory is that most of the data is in the divisions. Decision-making processes that work well without senior attention are critical to success in circumstances of sustaining innovation. For those decisions that the mainstream processes and values were designed to make effectively (sustaining, primarily) less senior executive invovlement is needed. It's when senior execs sense that the processes and values of the mainstream organization were not designed to handle important decisions in an organization (such as in disruptive circumstances), that senior execs need to participate. Disruptive innovation : powerful senior managers must personally be involved. Sustaining innovation : delegation works effectively. Barring the employees from deviating from the standard would kill innovation. Create a system to surface the most important and successful innovations from the day-to-day operations level of the company. Plant managers were evaluated on the measures of plant performance in these reports, and their reputation was affected by the relative ranking of their plants. This system, in other words, provided ample motivation for managers to search for any innovation that would improve their performance and relative ranking. *** CREATING A GROWTH ENGINE: (1) - It needs to operate rhythmically, by policy, rather than in response. Start before you need to. Build while you are still growing. A budgeted number of new businesses that need to be launched each year. (2) - CEO or senior exec must lead the effort - someone who has authority to lead from the top when necessary Be able to separate ideas with disruptive potential from those that are best deployed on an established sustaining trajectory (3) - Establish a small corporate-level group - ""movers and shapers"" - whose members develop a repeatable system for shaping ideas into disruptive business plans that are funded and launched Create a separately operating process through which ideas can be shaped into high-potential disruptions. Collect disruptive innovation ideas and mold them into propositions that fit the litmus tests outlined in Chapters 2-6. The members of this team have to understand these theories at a deep level, stick together, and apply them frequently. (4) - Train the troops : System for training and retraining people throughout the organization, to identify disruptive opportunities and take them to the movers and shapers Capturing ideas for new-growth from people in direct contact with markets and technologies is far more productive. EPLIOGUE: Where you start, relative to the direction of the competitive, technological, and profit-seeking forces acting upon you, can make a huge difference in the probability that you will succeed. This view simplifies the challenge of creating new-growth businesses. It means that when you start a new business you do not need to envision accurately the details of your strategy or predict foresightedly how technology will evolve. Rather, you need to focus primarily on getting the initial conditions right. If you start from a good place, then the choices that lead to success will look like the right choices. ADVICE TO EXECS: * - Never say yes to a strategy that targets customers and markets that look attractive to an established competitor. Find clients that established competitors will be happy to ignore. * - If your target customer is already using pretty-good products, instead find a way to find nonconsumers. Customers need to be delighted to have a simple inexpensive alternative to nothing. * - If there are no nonconsumers available, explore whether a low-end disruption is feasible * - Help customers get done more conveniently and inexpensively what they are already trying to get done * - Segment the market in ways that mirror the jobs customers are trying to get done. * - Develop competencies where the money will be made in the future * - When a new venture is said to fit your company's core competence, ask these 3 questions: * - Do we have the resources to succeed? * - Will our processes facilitate what needs to be done to succeeed in the new business? * - Will our values enable the critical people to give the needed priority to this initiative, when compared to the other initiatives that compete for time/money/talent? * - Ask these last 3 questions about your channel partners, as well. * - In choosing the management team for your new venture, search their resumes for the problems they have grappled with, and compare them to the problems that you know this venture must confront. * - Halt decisive plans to implement any strategy before there is evidence that it works. * - Be impatient for profit * - Keep your company growing so that you can be patient for growth","Required reading for business-owners and investors. Shows how technology improves faster than people's ability to use it, so when someone says a technology is “not good enough”, add “yet” and prepare for disruption."
Small is the New Big,Seth Godin,1591841267,8,"A true brand is something where the self-esteem value far exceeds the utility. There's a truly emotional connection between the brand and the user. The future is about work that's really and truly hard: the kind of work that requires us to push ourselves. This is where our future job-security, our financial profit, and our future joy lie. It's hard work to invent a new system, service, or process that's remarkable. Working hard is about taking an apparent risk : something that the competition (and co-workers) believe is unsafe but that you realize is in fact more conservative than sticking with the status quo. Remarkable doesn't mean weird, cheap, expensive, big, or small. It's just something worth talking about. things you can do to start Zooming: 1. for dinner tonight, try a food you've never tasted. then a different one tomorrow night. 2. listen to a CD from a genre you hate or have never heard 3. every week, read a magazine you've never read 4. every week, meet with someone from outside your area of expertise. go to a trade show on a topic you have no interest in. 5. change the layout of your office The art of Zooming makes it easier for you to see everything as an opportunity. Why are the fire-trucks so clean? Because when there isn't a fire, they wait for the siren to ring. While waiting, they clean the truck. Sounds like where you work? Staffed with people waiting for the alarm to ring. Instead of going out to the community and working to prevent new fires, the mind-set is that firemen are working to put out the fires that have started. Hotel desk clerks don't write letters or make calls to generate new business. They stand at the desk waiting for new business to arrive. In fast-changing markets, clean fire trucks show attention to detail but rarely lead to growth and success. Your business has to work when it's small in order to survive to the point where it gets big. Clowns think science is optional. If you run ads and they don't work, it doesn't matter how you spin it, they didn't work. Clowns refuse to measure results. Wishful thinking is not a replacement for the real world. Figure out how to get every employee to understand that they are the marketing department. One real-estate broker in Massachusetts now works by the hour. If you work by the hour, what would happen if you worked by commission? If you work by commission, what would happen if you worked by the hour? You can avoid the zero-profit condition by creating a huge barrier to entry. You do that with the assets, the extras, and the skills your competition can't get quickly. Competence is the enemy of change. Competent people resist change because change threatens to make them less competent. Competent people like being competent. That's who they are, and sometimes that's all they've got. No wonder they're not in a hurry to rock the boat. Do what Southwest Airlines does : don't hire people with experience at another airline unless you're sure they can unlearn what they learned there. Professional women in NYC think that lots of women keep their maiden name when married, but it's actually less than 5%. People who work out all the time figure that most people do, too. (They don't.) People who run wineries figure that lots of people care about wine. (They don't.) Most people don't care as much as you do about the stuff you care about. Why as soon as a company gets successful does it cease to innovate? How do the founders forget it was innovation that got them there? They didn't succeed by worrying about doing the same old thing out of fear of criticism, but by being willing to take a risk and break the rules. Market leaders are afraid. Successful companies fear external criticism. Successful innovators are more subject to harsh criticism. Less innovative employees have carte blanche to criticize the innovators unfairly. When people become associated with an idea or company, the personal stakes get higher. They risk greater criticism and losing the respect and devotion of the public. Steve Jobs, Julia Roberts, etc : it's not about the money, it's about the aura of wisdom and insight they've created. Apprach one of them with a daring new idea, and you're going to face quite a challenge in getting them to accept it. As companies mature and grow, they are far more likely to hire people to perform tasks, as opposed to hiring people who figure out how to change their jobs for the better. These new people are there because they like the status quo. They like their jobs. That's why they took them. Whatever you want to change at your company as to be unfairly compared with whatever is happening there now, like this: ""The worst possible outcome of what you're promoting must be better than the best possible outcome of what we're doing now."" New idea proposed gets shot down with, ""But that will upset people who want XYZ!"" - even if that's only 1% of customers. Disrespect is in the eye of the beholder. If you feel disrespected, then you were. (Describes bad customer service.) All the other person had to do was use a 1-or-2-sentence apology and the whole thing would have been fine. It's not the substance, it's the style. Ask people who are thriving in today's economy to name 5 things that helped them succeed, and they'll say: 1. finding, hiring, and managing super-great people 2. embracing change and moving quickly 3. understanding and excelling at business development and making deals with other companies 4. prioritizing tasks in a job that changes every day 5. selling: to people, companies, markets If you're defining yourself and your business in terms of your competition, you're living in an echo chamber. There are 2 ways to grow: by stealing from the competition, or by growing the market. The 1st is slow and painful, the 2nd is where the magic of fast growth kicks in. BLOGGING: Blogging requires you to have a healthy respect for your opinions as well as the generous desire to share them with others. Blogs matter : if you want to grow, you'll need to touch the information-hungry idea-sharing people that read and write them. Blogs work when they are based on candor, urgency, timeliness, pithiness, controversy, utility. If you can't be at least 4 of these, don't bother. Great story about odd promotion : buy $200 of stuff, get $40 gift certificate. (No notice before the purchase. Not designed as an enticement to get me to buy anything.) Seth bought two ties for $39. Woman carrying big shopping bags was on her fourth batch of gift certificates. Every time she got $20, she needed to spend it right away. Ended up spending more than $100 each time, so then went back to get another certificate, then needed to spend those, etc. Many people were doing this. People ""earn"" the certificate, then afraid to lose what's theirs, they go over to collect it, and because it's free money, they spend it, and the cycle continues. This is so much more effective than the typical markdown. I bet it would work even better online. Imagine how it could help shopping cart conversion. Turn strangers into friends. (""friends"" are prospects you've earned permission to talk with: even though they haven't turned into customers yet) Turn friends into customers. (""customers"" were converted from total strangers, to interested friends, then all the way to dedicated users.) Turn your customers into salespeople. (* most important) Figure out how to empower people who like you, who have a vested interest in your success. Flickr: the community is too large and powerful. You can't outperform them. You must join them. Functionality is the new marketing. Why else did Amazon spend millions to search book contents? Big Hairy Audacious goals restore your view of the future. Without a big hairy audacious goal, it's too easy to be distracted by momentary setbacks. It's cheaper to make stuff right the first time, than to fix it later. Style is free. (Apple store: carpeting, paneling, etc, all costs regardless, so might as well style it great.) When I change my mind, something chemical happens. I go from one mental state to another, and I can feel something flip. Don't assume your co-workers are open to change. Loosen up their flip-muscle. Start by changing everyone's minds about something astonishingly simple, obvious, and unimportant. Establish a pattern in which people flip (change their minds). That's the first step towards creating an atmosphere where things actually get done. If you're going to do it, do it now. Take the cash and momentum you get from being at the Local Max (big fish small pond), and invest a fraction of it into a new smaller team without traditional constraints that will launch something new and disruptive. Even something that competes. Local Max companies make 2 big mistakes: 1 - believing they can get to the next Max in a linear, pain-free way 2 - believing the best way to get there is with brute force (more products, salespeople, ads, buildings, staff) The opposite is true. The more you coddle your new team, the harder it will be for them to find the new Max. Marketer doesn't get to run the conversation : it's a brand cocktail party. You get to set the table and invite the first batch of guests, but after that the conversation is going to happen with or without you. You don't get the privilege of deciding what people will think. If they think it, then their truth is already established. When selling to a big company that is saying ""not yet"", saleswoman said, ""If you don't commit today, we're going to have to offer it to your competitors. All I need you to do is to initial this sheet of paper that says you heard the presentation and that you decided not to take advantage of our offer."" ""Not yet"" or ""no decision today"" means ""NO""! Put an email address on every x-ray machine at every airport, saying, ""Do you know how to make security screening better? Drop us a line!"" Some companies have decided the best way to make a buck is to race to the bottom, to be the cheapest or fastest to market. (People who cut corners during the day so they can buy what they like at night.) When you win a race to the top, you end up with healthy motivated people focused on adding creativity and joy to your products. Profit and market-shar and a community that's glad you're there. When you win a race to the bottom? .... Mission statements used to have a purpose: to force management to make hard decisions about what the company stood for. Giving up one thing to get another. I don't believe that sucking the money out of the music business will eliminate the musicians, but it will change the middlemen. NAMING: A brand name is a peg on which people hang all the attributes of your business. The less it has to do with your category, the better. If you call yourself International Postal Consultants, there's a lot less room to hang other attributes. Some names I like : Starbucks, Nike, Apple. Pick a real English word or a string of them. JetBlue, Ambient, and Amazon are good. Fewer trademark hassles. Flickr, 37Signals. Millions of names like this : Lemonpie for a scuba tour company. But get a great tagline. ""Lemonpie, the easy way to learn scuba."" Come up with a cool name that means nothing and is easy to hang a good brand upon. Having the perfect domain name is nice, but way more important to have a name that works in a search for you. (A built-in search optimization strategy.) Pick a unique name that is easy to remember and spell - and one that is likely to put you at the top of the search engine results. Don't get too generic, or people will never find you without the .com A great word is more important than a perfect domain. Try http://www.nameboy.com Figure out what the ""always"" is, and do something else. (Purple Cow) ""Pay attention"" are key words. If you've got someone's attention, they're already paying with the most precious commodity they've got. Online, you don't have one retail store, you have 50,000 retail stores, and you know what each customer is looking for before they walk in! Clerk asks, ""Can I have your email address for our newsletter?"" No! But, ""You just qualified for a $20 gift certificate. We can email it to you. You also get a list of special books, 6 times a year."" Now that's an offer about me, not them! Something I can use now. A promise of what I'm going to get (and not get). Superstition: by enforcing to rigid adherence they believe they are responsible for their organization's success. By requiring employees to abide by these superstitions, (aka company policies), rather than examining the facts, they build organizations that appear streamlined, but are actually doomed. It would be surprising to meet a monk or priest that would say, ""Yes we burn incense (or turn down lights or ring these bells or light these candles) as a way of creating an atmosphere where people are more likely to believe in their prayers."" - but of course that's exactly what they're doing. The design of your website is nothing but an affect designed to create the placebo effect. The ""Relentless Pursuit of Better"" is the opposite of ""good enough"". (It's not Jack Welch's Six Sigma nonsense, though which engineers codify mediocrity.) It's a consistent posture of changing the rules on an ongoing basis. If JetBlue raised their price $10 on their NYC to Florida run, they'd make an extra $11 million a year in profit. CEO said, ""We could always do that later. Right now, it keeps us focused and hungry and efficient to do it for less."" Sneezers find you, if you hang out where they hang out. Starbucks didn't open their first shops in South Dakota, even though storefronts are cheap there. Apple opens their stores in similar thinking (Times Square, etc). Software guys realize a post to Slashdot is worth more than ten ads in Time magazine, and Steven Spielberg doesn't hesitate to visit SciFi conventions. ==================================== SETH'S BASIC RULES OF MARKETING: + Anticipated personal relevant advertising always does better than unsolicited junk. + Making promises and keeping them is a great way to build a brand. + Your best customers are worth far more than your average customers. + Share of wallet is easier, more profitable, and ultimately more effective a measure of success than share of market. + Marketing begins before the product is created. + Advertising is just a symptom, a tactic. Marketing is about far more than that. + Low price is a great way to sell a commodity. That's not marketing, though. That's efficiency. + Conversations among the people in your marketplace happen whether you like it or not. Good marketing encourages the right sort of conversations. + Products that are remarkable inspire conversation. + Marketing is the way your people answer the phone, the typesetting on your bills, and your returns policy. + You can't fool all the people, not even most of the time. Once they catch you, they talk about the experience. + If you are marketing from a fairly static annual budget, you're viewing marketing as an expense. Good marketers realize that it's an investment. + People don't buy what they need. They buy what they want. + You're not in charge. And your prospects don't care about you. + What people what is the extra, emotional bonus they get when they buy something they love. + B2B marketing is just marketing to consumers who happen to have a corporation pay for what they buy. + Traditional ways of interrupting customers (TV ads, trade show booths, junk mail) are losing their cost-effectiveness. At the same time, new ways of spreading ideas (blogs, RSS, fan clubs) are quickly proving how well they work. + People all over the world, and of every income level, respond to marketing that promises and delivers basic human wants. + Good marketers tell a story. + People are selfish, lazy, uninformed, and impatient. Start with that and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what you find. + Marketing that works is marketing that people choose to notice. + Effective stories match the worldview of the people you are telling the story to. + Choose your customers. Fire the ones that hurt your ability to deliver the right story to the others. + A product for everyone rarely reaches anyone. + Living and breathing an authentic story is the best way to survive in a conversation-rich world. + Marketers are also responsible for the side effects their products cause. + Reminding the consumer of a story they know and trust is a powerful shortcut. + Good marketers measure. + Marketing is not an emergency. It's a planned, thoughful exercise that started a long time ago, and doesn't end until you're done. + One disappointed customer is worth as much as ten delighted ones. ==================================== Imagine 5 success stories from the past decade: Cisco, Palm, Yahoo, Starbucks, JetBlue. (or pick others) Now list 6 decisions that each company made that turned it into a success - that transformed it from an ordinary company into an extraordinary success. (There might be even fewer than 6.) Everything else those companies did around those decisions is just commentary. Yes there were important operations that made those decisions valid, but those operations weren't the key to those companies' success. ""Business model innovation is a key success factor."" - (strategist Gary Hamel) Fuller Brush salesmen knew something important : after you ring the bell, take a step or two backward. RIFT: a big tear in the fabric of the rules we live by. A fundamental change in the game that creates a bunch of new losers and a few new winners. Many people who build important businesses build them on a rift, usually one they find by accident, and usually only once. Sometimes, after they succeeded once, they fool themselves into thinking that they're so gifted that everywhere they look, they can see a rift. A change in the rules you can turn into an opportunity. ============================== Success Secrets of Tomorrow's Internet: 1. Relentless Execution * 2. Resistance to Compromise 3. What you don't do. (best new net companies understand in their heart & soul what they won't do) 4. Desire to be 3 steps ahead (not just 2) 5. Doing something worth doing 6. Connecting people to people 7. Monetizing from the first moment. (You can't charge money if the only reason you're charging is to make a profit. Charing adds friction and selectivity. If those two elements are a drag on your service, you will fail.) 8. Not depending on a big partner 9. Ignoring the pundits 10. Keeping promises ============================== How to build an email list : 1. Offer something in your newsletter that people actually want to read. 2. Promise people exactly what you intend to give them 3. Create content so remarkable that people want to share it 4. If you take your time and keep your promises, it'll build if it deserves to build. SMALL For the last six years, I've had exactly one employee : me. This has changed my work life in ways I hadn't predicted. The biggest changes are: The kind of project that's ""interesting"" is now very different. It doesn't have to be strategic or scalable or profitable enough to feed an entire division. It just has to be interesting or fun or good for my audience. The idea of risk is different: I can write an e-book and launch it in some crazy way and just see what happens. I can build a dot-com enterprise with a questionable business model and just see what happens. Because my costs are nothing compared to those of a large organization, there are no boundaries in the way I can approach something (compared to, say, a publisher or public company, or multinational). If you don't have to bet the farm on every launch, you're way more likely to launch more, and more randomly, which vastly increases your odds. Don't grow unless it gives you joy. Little companies often make more money than big companies. Small means the founder is involved in a far greater percentage of customer interactions. Small means the founder is close to the decisions that matter, and can make them quickly. Small gives you the flexibility to change your business model when your competition changes theirs. Small means you can tell the truth on your blog. Small means you outsource the boring low-impact stuff like manufacturing, shipping, billing, packing to others, while: You keep all the power because you invent something that's remarkable and tell your story to people who want to hear it. No reason at all to build a big company anymore. Since big companies are no more profitable than little ones, it's the little ones that are most likely to spring up, make a difference, and then (without tears) disappear, only to reappear at some other time, in some other place. -- Mismatched socks : how many sock marketers thought of this, then got scared and didn't go for it? You're not listening to your customers when you tell them, ""You need me"". You listen to your customers when you say, ""You really don't need me."" Find products for your customers, instead of finding customers for your products. When the world changes, being good at yesterday's business is a liability. Quit making stuff, and start making a difference. What if you had to start something? What would it be? You don't need a good idea to start a business - you can steal one. Find someone in another town or industry and do what they're doing. Once you get started, your original idea is going to be replaced anyway. Smart entrepreneurs don't stick to the original business plan. You'll realize that every day is another day closer to success, and changing the plan is part of the plan. Thinking big: speaking to a room of high-powered multi-millionaires, and on the way out, passed a room of local CPAs. The people in the first room weren't necessarily smarter, they just aimed higher. People in the 2nd room had made a decision about what they deserved, or what they were capable of, or what they were going to stick with. And it was a bad decision. The biggest chasm in our society has become the gap between the people who embrace the torchbearer's responsibility to customers, investors, and companies, and those who are just there for the job. Torchbearers often attract a crowd. People are fascinated by individuals who are willing to carry responsibility. Torchbearers don't realize how unique they are, how powerful their role is, or how difficult their task is. Torchbearers care more about forward motion than they do which route to take. Won't find them looking for perfect solutions in meetings. Torchbearers don't stop until they finish. Balance between devotion to duty and the pursuit of joy. A torchbearer never forgets about or shortchanges a duty, even when that means postponing joy. What would happen if your friends treated you the way that marketers do? If your wife sold your personal information to anyone who would pay? If your boss promised miraculous changes then failed to deliver? If your friends wouldn't talk to you until you spent 30 minutes on hold? What if the people you liked and trusted made promises to get your attention and cooperation, then broke those promises whenever they could get away from it? Have the courage to make promises and keep them. Do more than you promised, not just what the contract says. All the magazine ads in the world can't undo one lousy clerk. The moment you take your special, authentic , limited-edition product and leverage it, make it widely available and common, the very people who loved it rebel. If you create something authentic, you have real choices. You need to decide how important it is to be real, how much of yourself you have tied up in the authentic experience you've created. Most of all, you need to decide what you'd like to do all day. People who create something authentic but then sell out almost always end up unhappy. Why? Because once you sell out, any new success you have doesn't come from your authenticity. People care about verbs more than nouns. ""Investing"" more than ""investments"". ""Painting"" more than ""paint"". ""Shopping"" or ""giving"" more than ""gift"". When employees are being an ass. Ask, ""Do you think the owner wanted them to act this way?"" and ""Would they have acted differently if they were on camera?"" The best motivation is self-motivation. Teaching people the right thing to do is far more effective than intimidating them into acting out of fear. But I also know people act differently when they think no one is watching. For an idea to spread, it needs to be sent and received. No one sends an idea unless: 1. they understand it 2. they want it to spread 3. they believe spreading it will enhance their power (reputation, income, friendships) or their peace of mind 4. the effort necessary to send is less than the benefits No one ""gets"" an idea unless: 1. the first impression demands further investigation 2. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new idea 3. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time. Whenever you try to take a prospect or customer (or employee) through a process, you run the risk of losing them. You lose a few at every step. Sometimes just a few out of a hundred drop out along the way. Sometimes much more. Too often, we forget to measure, to discover the wall, the one step in the process that loses a huge portion of the population. Maybe if we left that step out, we'd get a little bit less from the new, but we'd get more from a whole bunch of people. Web designers: Say to your prospect, ""I will work with you to build up a 4-page engine of revenue. You load it up with targeted traffic that you buy by regularly trying and testing adwords and other relevant, measurable media. Then I will regularly constantly tweak or redesign the 4-page site to turn those strangers into friends. (And maybe, if your product is great, you can turn those friends into customers.)"" Thing is: it's probably cheaper to constantly measure and evolve and redesign a 4-page offer site than it is to do the annual 400-page website overhaul. And there's no question it's more effective. Find ideas that matter and share them. Push ourselves and the people around us to demonstrate gratitude, insight, and inspiration. Take risks and make the world better by being amazing. WHAT IF...? - hard drive space is free - wifi is everywhere - connection speeds are 100x faster - the number of new albums released each day is 10x more than now - etc When customers ask, ""Why?"" (why is that your policy? why can't I do it this way?) - the single most efficient technique for improving your operations is answering the why questions! You should embrace these people, not send them away.","I’m a massive fan and disciple. A collection of his short insightful posts from his blog, all thought-provoking and inspiring for anybody marketing anything, even music."
Getting Things Done,David Allen,0142000280,8,"TWO KEY OBJECTIVES: 1 - Capturing all things into a logical and trusted system 2 - Make decisons about all the inputs you let into your life, so that you will always have a plan for next actions Everyone feels they have too much to handle, and not enough time to get it all done. Taking on more than they have resources to handle. Work : anything you want to be different than it currently is. How much available data could be relevant to doing these projects ""better""? The answer is, an infinite amount, easily accessible through the web. We're allowing in huge amounts of information and communication from the outer world and generating an equally large volume of ideas and agreements with ourselves and others from our inner world. A huge number of internal and external commitments. The ability to be successful, relaxed, and in control during these fertile but terbulent times demands new ways of thinking and working. There is a great need for new methods, technologies, and work habits to help us get on top of our world. Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax. Clearing the mind and being flexible are key. Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does. Most of the stress people experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept. Learn to control the ""open loops"". MANAGING COMMITMENTS: 1. If it's on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Anything unfinished must be captured. 2. Clarify exactly what your commitment is. 3. Keep reminders of actions organized in a system you review regularly. Write down the project or situation that is most on your mind at this moment. Describe, in a single sentence, your intended succesful outcome for this problem or situation. Write down the very next physical action required to move the situation forward. WHY THINGS ARE ON YOUR MIND: You want it to be differently than it currently is, and yet: - you haven't clarified exactly what the intended outcome is - you haven't decided what the very next physical action step is - you haven't put reminders of the outcome and the action required into a system you trust It's a waste of time and energy to keep thinking about something that you make no progress on. There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought. We need to transform all the ""stuff"" we're trying to organize into actionable stuff we need to do. Get in the habit of keeping nothing on your mind. You can't DO a project. You can only do an action related to it. Many actions require only a minute or two, in the appropriate context, to move a project forward. Lack of time is not the major issue, though you may think it is. The real problem is a lack of clarity and definition about what a project really is, and what the associated next-action steps required are. Clarifying things on the front end, when they first appear on the radar, rather than on the back end, after trouble has developed, allows people to reap the benefits of managing action. I capture and organize 100% of my stuff in and with objective tools at hand, not in my mind. That applies to everything - little or big - personal or professional - urgent or not. Everything. Your mind will keep working on anything that's still in that undecided state. STAGES WE GO THROUGH AS WE DEAL WITH OUR WORK: - collect things - process what they mean and what to do about them - organize the results - review as options for what we choose to... - ... do Collect and gather together placeholders for all the things you consider incomplete in your world. Anything you think ought to be different than it currently is and that you have any level of internal commitment to changing. Stuff --> In Basket --> What is it? Is it actionable? YES: What's the next action? Will it take less than 2 minutes? YES: Do it now. NO: Am I the right person to do this? YES: Defer it (Keep track in Calendar or Next Actions) NO: Delegate it. (Keep track in ""Waiting"") NO: Reference (retrievable when required) Someday/Maybe Trash it A project is any desired result that requires more than one action step. The next-action decision is central. That action needs to be the next physical visible behavior, without exception, on every open loop. CALENDAR: every action that has to happen at a specific time or date. NEXT ACTIONS LIST: those that need to be done as soon as they can WAITING FOR: all you're waiting for others to do Subdivide your Next Actions into categories, like Business Hours or With Assistant - so that next time you're at a phone or with your assistant you can do them all at once. Scan all the defined actions and options before you, radically increasing the efficacy of the choices you make about what you're doing at any point in time. How will you decide what to do and what not to do? By trusting your intuition. WEEKLY REVIEW: - gather and process all your stuff - review your system - update your lists - get clean, clear, current, and complete BIG REVIEW: - life - 3-5 year vision - 1-2 year goals - areas of responsibility - current projects - current actions Thing of your purpose. Think of what a successful outcome would look like. Where would you be physically, financially, reputation-wise, or whatever? Brainstorm potential steps. Organize your ideas. Decide on the next actions. Are you any clearer about where you want to go and how to get there? People love to win. If you're not totally clear about the purpose of what you're doing, you have no chance of winning. VALUE OF ANSWERING ""WHY"": - creates decision-making criteria - aligns resources - motivates - clarifies focus - expands options, opens up creative thinking A great way to think about what your principles are, is to complete this sentence: ""I would give others totally free rein to do this, as long as they... "" You won't see how to do it until you see yourself doing it. 1. View the project from beyond the completion date 2. Envision wild success! (Suspend ""yeah but..."") 3. Capture features, aspects, qualities you imagine in place Asking what specific physical action you'd take next, if you had nothing else to do, will test the maturity of your thinking about the project. A project is sufficiently planned for implementation when every next-action step has been decided on every front that can actually be moved on without some other components having to be completed first. If the project has multiple components, each of them should be assessed by asking, ""Is there something that anyone could be doing on this right now?"" In some cases, there will be only one aspect that can be activated, and everything else will depend on the results of that. The highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives. Everything gets processed equally. ""Process"" means decide what the thing is, what action is required, then dispatch it accordingly. Emergency scanning - looking for the most urgent, fun, or interesting stuff in your in box - is not processing. Emails are more efficient to process last-first because of all the discussion threads that accumulate on top of one another. Your CPA can provide record-retention timetables that will tell you how long you should keep what kinds of documentation. SOMEDAY/MAYBE : ""there's nothing to do on this now, but there might be later"". An event in the future you're not sure if you'll be around for. Something you'd rather sleep on it for a week. Until you know what the next physical action is, there's still more thinking required before anything can happen. Deciding isn't really an action. You just need more information before you can make a decision. Is that information external sources or internal thinking? Even if the item is not high-priority, do it now if you're ever going to do it at all. Record the date on everything you hand-off to others. If you put reference materials in the same pile as things you still want to read, you'll go numb to the stack! You'll get a great feeling when you know that your ""Waiting For"" list is the complete inventory of everything you care about that other people are supposed to be doing. Don't use support material for reminding! You'll go numb because they don't prompt you to do anything. If you have a project that you don't really need to think about now, but deserves a flag at some point in the future, put it on your calendar. If you have a list of calls you must make, the minute that list is not totally current with *all* the calls you need to make, your brain will not trust the system, and it won't get relief from its lower-level mental tasks. It will have to take back the job of remembering and reminding, which as you know it doesn't do very efficiently. Review the lists of all the actions you could possible do in your current context. Evaluate them against the flow of other work coming at you, to ensure that you make the best choices about what to deal with. The weekly review is whatever you need to do to get your head empty again. Until you can honestly say, ""I absolutely know right now everything I'm not doing but could be doing if I decided to."" Always keep an inventory of things that need to be done that require very little mental or creative horsepower. One of the best ways to increase your energy is to close some of your loops. So always be sure to have some easy loops to close, right at hand. Do ad-hoc work as it shows up, not because it is the path of least resistance, but because it is the thing you need to do, vis-á-vis all the rest. All of us could be doing more planning, more informally, and more often, about our projects and our lives. If we did, it would relieve a lot of pressure on our psyches and produce an enormous amount of creative output with minimal effort. The real need is to capture and utilize more of the creative, proactive thinking we do - or could do. I'm on a mission to make ""What's the next action?"" part of the global thought process. It would only require about 10 seconds of thinking to figure out what the next action would be for almost everything on your list. But most people haven't. Because we procrastinate what we can imagine as being tedious, creative, sensitive, and intelligent people procrastinate the most because their sensitivity gives them the capability of producing lurid nightmare scenarios about all the negative consequences that might occur if it weren't done perfectly! Who doesn't procrastinate? The insensitive oafs who just take something and start plodding forward, unaware of all the things that could go wrong. Everyone else tends to get hung up about all kinds of things. To many meetings end wiht a vague feeling that something ought to happen, and the hope that it's not their personal job to make it so. Getting things going builds a more positive self-image than repeating affirmations in a mirror. If it can be changed, there's some action that will change it. If it can't, it must be considered part of the landscape to be incorporated in strategy and tactics. Complaining is a sign that someone isn't willing to risk moving on a changeable situation, or won't consider the immutable circumstance in his or her plans. This is a temporary and hollow form of self-validation. When you start to make things happen, you really begin to believe you can make things happen. And that makes things happen. There are only two problems in life: (1) - you know what you want but don't know how to get it ... and / or ... (2) - you don't know what you want ""Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes, and seeing them gratified."" - Dr. Samuel Johnson",Classic book with near-cult following.

The 48 Laws of Power,Robert Greene and Joost Elffers,0140280197,8,"Law 1: Never Outshine the Master Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite – inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power. Law 2: Never put too Much Trust in Friends, Learn how to use Enemies Be wary of friends-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them. Law 3: Conceal your Intentions Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late. Law 4: Always Say Less than Necessary When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. Law 5: So Much Depends on Reputation – Guard it with your Life Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once you slip, however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them. Law 6: Court Attention at all Cost Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention by appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious, than the bland and timid masses. Law 7: Get others to do the Work for you, but Always Take the Credit Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you. Law 8: Make other People come to you – use Bait if Necessary When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains – then attack. You hold the cards. Law 9: Win through your Actions, Never through Argument Any momentary triumph you think gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate. Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky You can die from someone else’s misery – emotional states are as infectious as disease. You may feel you are helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead. Law 11: Learn to Keep People Dependent on You To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without you. Law 12: Use Selective Honesty and Generosity to Disarm your Victim One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift – a Trojan horse – will serve the same purpose. Law 13: When Asking for Help, Appeal to People’s Self-Interest, Never to their Mercy or Gratitude If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for himself. Law 14: Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying. Law 15: Crush your Enemy Totally All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit. Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity. Law 17: Keep Others in Suspended Terror: Cultivate an Air of Unpredictability Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people’s actions. Your predictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize. Law 18: Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself – Isolation is Dangerous The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere – everyone has to protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from – it cuts you off from valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people find allies, mingle. You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd. Law 19: Know Who You’re Dealing with – Do Not Offend the Wrong Person There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then – never offend or deceive the wrong person. Law 20: Do Not Commit to Anyone It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others – playing people against one another, making them pursue you. Law 21: Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker – Seem Dumber than your Mark No one likes feeling stupider than the next persons. The trick, is to make your victims feel smart – and not just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may have ulterior motives. Law 22: Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power When you are weaker, never fight for honor’s sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating you – surrender first. By turning the other check you infuriate and unsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power. Law 23: Concentrate Your Forces Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another – intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come. Law 24: Play the Perfect Courtier The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the mot oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the laws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise in the court. Law 25: Re-Create Yourself Do not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define if for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions – your power will be enhanced and your character will seem larger than life. Law 26: Keep Your Hands Clean You must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless appearance by using others as scapegoats and cat’s-paws to disguise your involvement. Law 27: Play on People’s Need to Believe to Create a Cultlike Following People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold power. Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit through audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid. Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead. Law 30: Make your Accomplishments Seem Effortless Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work – it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you. Law 31: Control the Options: Get Others to Play with the Cards you Deal The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the horns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn. Law 32: Play to People’s Fantasies The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. Law 33: Discover Each Man’s Thumbscrew Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usual y an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn to your advantage. Law 34: Be Royal in your Own Fashion: Act like a King to be treated like one The way you carry yourself will often determine how you are treated; In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown. Law 35: Master the Art of Timing Never seem to be in a hurry – hurrying betrays a lack of control over yourself, and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition. Law 36: Disdain Things you cannot have: Ignoring them is the best Revenge By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem. Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of power – everyone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around you, then full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing. Law 38: Think as you like but Behave like others If you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only with tolerant friends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness. Law 39: Stir up Waters to Catch Fish Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings. Law 40: Despise the Free Lunch What is offered for free is dangerous – it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By paying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise to pay the full price – there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for generosity is a sign and a magnet for power. Law 41: Avoid Stepping into a Great Man’s Shoes What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your own making: Establish your own name and identity by changing course. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain power by shining in your own way. Law 42: Strike the Shepherd and the Sheep will Scatter Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual – the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoned of goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not wait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them – they are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will scatter. Law 43: Work on the Hearts and Minds of Others Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions, playing on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts and minds of others and they will grow to hate you. Law 44: Disarm and Infuriate with the Mirror Effect The mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for deception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their values; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power of Mirror Effect. Law 45: Preach the Need for Change, but Never Reform too much at Once Everyone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past. Law 46: Never appear too Perfect Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity. Law 47: Do not go Past the Mark you Aimed for; In Victory, Learn when to Stop The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and when you reach it, stop. Law 48: Assume Formlessness By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.","Warning: some think this book is pure evil. But power exists, so it can only help to understand it better, even if you choose not to wield it."
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Dummies,Rob Willson and Rhena Branch,1119601126,7,"You feel the way you think. Be like a scientist: treat your thoughts as theories, rather than facts. Event → Beliefs → Feelings and actions. The meaning is assigned in “Beliefs”. The meaning you attach influences the emotional response. Break down a problems using ABC: A = Activating event - the trigger - a real external event that has occurred, a future event that you anticipate occurring, or an internal event in your mind, such as an image, memory, or dream. B = Beliefs - thoughts, personal rules, demands you make on yourself or world, and the meanings that you attach to external and internal events. C = Consequences - emotions, behaviours, and physical sensations that accompany different emotions. Write down your problem in ABC form to differentiate between your thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and the trigger event. Focus on how your problems are being maintained rather than on searching for a single root cause of the problem. Mull over the pros and cons of the way you think. If you’re feeling excessively bad, chances are that you’re thinking badly - in an unhelpful way. Catastrophising is taking a relatively minor negative event and imagining all sorts of disasters resulting from that one small event. Extreme thinking leads to extreme emotions and behaviors. Instead of all-or-nothing thinking, try both-and reasoning. You need to mentally allow two seeming opposites to exist together. Fortune-Telling: You’re better off letting the future unfold without trying to guess how it may turn out. A ship is safe in a harbour, but that’s not what ships are built for. Live experimentally and take calculated risks to keep life interesting. Mind-reading: to assume that others are thinking negative things about you or have negative motives. Your past experiences don’t determine your future experiences. Your guesses may be wrong. Generate alternative reasons for what you see. Get more information. Remind yourself that feelings aren’t facts. Ask yourself how you’d view the situation if you were feeling calmer. Overgeneralising is the error of drawing global conclusions from one or more events. The inflexibility of the demands you place on yourself, the world around you, and other people often means you don’t adapt to reality as well as you could. Replace words like ‘must’, ‘need’, and ‘should’ with ‘prefer’, ‘wish’, and ‘want’. The world doesn’t play to your rules. Limit approval seeking. Make a satisfying life even if you don’t get the approval of everyone you seek it from. Mental filtering: when you acknowledge only information that fits with a belief you hold. Deliberately collect evidence that contradicts your negative thoughts. Gather evidence to prove that your negative thought isn’t true. Foster high frustration tolerance. Push yourself to do things that are uncomfortable or unpleasant. Give yourself messages that emphasise your ability to withstand pain. Many things can be difficult to tolerate, but rating them as ‘intolerable’ often makes situations seem more daunting than they really are. Remove yourself from the centre of the universe. Look for explanations of events that have little or nothing to do with you. Figure out which thinking errors you tend to make the most. Jot down your thoughts whenever you feel upset and note what was happening at the time. The way you think affects the way you feel. Therefore, changing your unhelpful thoughts is a key to feeling better. (ABC: Activating event, Beliefs and thoughts, Consequences) The first step is to see the connection between your thoughts and emotions. Emotions and behaviour are consequences (C) of the interaction between the activating event or trigger (A) and the beliefs or meanings (B) In Consequences, write down how you acted. How your behaviour changed when you felt your uncomfortable emotion. In Activating Event, write down what triggered your feelings. Something happening right now, something that occurred in the past, something that you’re anticipating to happen in the future, something in the external world. Something in your mind. Identify the thinking errors that may exist in the thoughts you list. Jumping to the worst possible conclusion? (Catastrophising) Thinking in extreme - all-or-nothing - terms? (Black-and-white thinking) Using words like ‘always’ and ‘never’ to draw generalised conclusions from a specific event? (Overgeneralising) Predicting the future instead of waiting to see what happens? (Fortune-telling) Jumping to conclusions about what other people are thinking of me? (Mind-reading) Focusing on the negative and overlooking the positive? (Mental filtering) Discounting positive information or twisting a positive into a negative? (Disqualifying the positive) Globally putting myself down as a failure, worthless, or useless? (Labelling) Listening too much to my negative gut feelings instead of looking at the objective facts? (Emotional reasoning) Taking an event or someone’s behaviour too personally or blaming myself and overlooking other factors? (Personalising) Using words like ‘should’, ‘must’, ‘ought’, and ‘have to’ in order to make rigid rules about myself, the world, or other people? (Demanding) Telling myself that something is too difficult or unbearable or that ‘I can’t stand it’ when actually it’s hard to bear but it is bearable and worth tolerating? (Having a low frustration tolerance) Examine and weaken your unhelpful thoughts: Can I prove that my thought is 100 per cent true? What are the effects of thinking this way? Is my thought wholly logical or sensible? Do people whose opinions I respect agree that this thought’s realistic? What evidence exists against this thought? Is my thought balanced, or extreme? Is my thought rigid or flexible? Am I thinking objectively and realistically, or are my thoughts being biased by how I feel? Generate alternatives for each of your unhelpful thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs. What’s a more helpful way of looking at the situation? Do I encourage friends to think in this way? When I’m feeling OK, how do I think differently? Have any past experiences shown me that another possible outcome exists? What’s a more flexible or less extreme way of thinking? What’s a more realistic or balanced way of thinking that takes into account the evidence that does not support my thought? Develop a plan to move forward. Test your thoughts in reality, rather than simply talking about them. Get unambiguous disconfirmation. Discover conclusively that your fears don’t come true. Describe your problem. Formulate your prediction. Execute an experiment. Examine the results. Take care not to use subtle ways of keeping your feared catastrophe at bay, such as doing experiments only when you feel ‘right’, are with ‘safe’ people, have safety signals to hand (such as a mobile phone or a bottle of water), or are using safety behaviours (such as trying to control your anxiety with distraction or by gripping tightly to your steering wheel). Using these subtle safety measures during your exposure to a fear can leave you with the impression that you’ve had a narrow escape, rather than highlighting that your predicted fear didn’t come true. If you feel depressed, you’re likely to withdraw and isolate yourself. Isolating and mood-depressing behaviours, like not seeing friends, increase your sense of isolation and maintain your low mood. Self-isolating behaviour is one of the key ways in which depression is maintained. Develop even one additional theory to compete with your original theory. Use surveys to see whether other people have the same thoughts. Keep records of experiments. Your thoughts, no matter how distressing and negative, are not the real problem. Rather, the importance or meaning you attach to those thoughts is what causes you the problem. Task concentration involves paying less attention to what’s going on inside of you and more attention to what’s happening outside of you. Concentrate harder on different aspects of the external environment. Be both task- and environment-focused rather than self-focused, even in situations that you regard as highly threatening. Direct your attention away from yourself, but not distracting yourself from your sensations or suppressing your thoughts. If you’re suffering from anxiety, you’re probably self-focused in social situations and fail to notice the rest of the world. Re-train your attention onto the outside world to help interrupt yourself from engaging with the stream of negative thoughts that accompanies depression. Mindfulness is a technique for dealing with depression. Keep your attention focused on the moment that you’re experiencing right now. Suspend your judgement about what you’re feeling, thinking, and absorbing through your senses. Simply observe what’s going on around you, in your mind, and in your body without doing anything. Your mind almost mechanically forms judgements about each of your experiences, labelling them as good, bad, or neutral depending on how you value them. But you may ignore neutral things or deem them to be boring. Feeling intense sadness can prompt you to do things to improve your situation, but depression’s more likely to lead to your inaction and resignation. Healthy emotions spring from flexible, preference-based thinking. So, thoughts and beliefs like ‘I prefer others to treat me respectfully, but they’re not bound to do so’ Meta-emotions can prevent you from dealing with your primary emotional problems. For example, you may be feeling guilty about having depression. Write down a plan of your daily activities and stick to doing them regardless of your mood, to help you achieve balance and consistency. Stick to a daily schedule of activities can help you avoid being under-stimulated during lows (thereby combating a downward spiral into depression) and help you avoid becoming over-stimulated during highs (thereby preventing an upward spiral into hypomania). The problematic behaviours that maintain or worsen emotional problems are the very behaviours that people use to help themselves cope - hence the common CBT expression ‘your solution is the problem’. Coping strategies may make you feel better in the short-term but that they are actually counterproductive - they can make things worse in the long-term. Short-term relief is reinforcing the very beliefs and behaviours that underpin your problems. Turn a counterproductive strategy on its head. Do the polar opposite of your established coping strategies. Doing only what you feel like doing when you are depressed is likely to maintain or worsen your symptoms. Instead, try doing the opposite of what your depression directs you towards doing. Feel better, get worse. Feel worse, get better. (when referring to overcoming emotional problems.) Hiding things about yourself - such as imperfections in your appearance, childhood experiences, mistakes from the past, or current psychological difficulties - can make you feel chronically insecure that someone may ‘find you out’. Hiding shameful aspects of your experiences also denies you the opportunity to find out that other people have similar experiences, and that they won’t think any less of you for revealing your secrets. Putting off essential tasks may save you some discomfort in the short term, but undone tasks also tend to weigh heavily on your mind. The purpose of therapy is to help you achieve your goals. CBT is whatever helps you move from your problems to your goals. Observable: Try to include in your goal a description of a behavioural change that you can observe. You first need to define the problem. Define how you want to feel as an alternative. You may decide that you want to feel sad and disappointed, rather than depressed and hurt. Feeling negative emotions about negative events is realistic and appropriate. Be wary of being influenced too easily by whatever’s foremost in your mind. (Mercurial desires) Rumination is a circular thought process in which you go over the same things again and again, trying to work out the root cause. Rumination is compelling because your depressed mood tells you that you must try to get to the bottom of why you feel bad. Rumination can take hold during activities if you’re acting mindlessly rather than mindfully Brainstorm solutions to your problem. You often form your core beliefs when you’re a child to help you make sense of your childhood experiences. After you’ve identified a situation that brings up negative emotions, ask yourself what the situation means or says about you. Your first answer is probably your negative automatic thought (NAT). Keep asking yourself what your previous answer means or says about you until you reach a global, absolute statement. Use the same technique to get to your core beliefs about other people and the world. Just keep asking yourself what your NAT means about others or the world. Ultimately, you can end up with a conclusive statement that is your core belief. Imagine your worst nightmare. Think of dream scenarios that wake you up screaming. Somewhere in these terrifying scenarios may be one or more of your core beliefs. Before your new positive beliefs are really stuck in your head and heart, you need to act as if they’re already there. Integrate your new method of thinking with your mind, emotions, and actions. Endorse your new belief or raise your strength of conviction. It’s enough to know in your head that your new belief makes sense and then act according to your new belief or philosophy. If you consistently do the ‘acting as if’ technique, which we explain here, your conviction in your new way of thinking is likely to grow over time. How would I behave if I truly considered my new belief to be true? If a new belief makes sense to you, follow it up with action. Generate arguments against an unhelpful belief. Generate sound arguments to support alternative, more helpful ways of thinking. Go into familiar situations where your old attitudes are typically triggered, and act according to your new way of thinking. When you start to recover from some types of emotional problems, such as depression, anxiety, or obsessions, you may find that you have a considerable amount of spare time available to you, which previously your symptoms took up. Indeed, you may be astounded to find out just how much energy, attention, and time, common psychological difficulties can actually consume.","If you haven’t looked into cognitive behavioral therapy, please do. It’s a clunky name but a great mindset. My notes here will give you an idea of what it’s about. It’s very effective for depression, anxiety, and more."
Prisoners of Geography,Tim Marshall,1501121472,7,"Geopolitics looks at the ways in which international affairs can be understood through geographical factors: Climate, demographics, cultural regions, and access to natural resources. China and India never have fought each other. Why? Because between them is the highest mountain range in the world. Leaders, ideas, technology, are temporary. The rules of geography still apply to today’s leaders. It doesn’t matter if the ideology of those in control is czarist, Communist, or crony capitalist - the ports still freeze, and the North European Plain is still flat. The conflict in Iraq and Syria is rooted in colonial powers ignoring the rules of geography, whereas the Chinese occupation of Tibet is rooted in obeying them. High up in the Urals there is a cross marking the place where Europe stops and Asia starts. When the skies are clear, it is beautiful. “Are you European or are you Asian?” “Neither - I am Russian.” Although 75 percent of Russia’s territory is in Asia, only 22 percent of its population lives there. The empty depopulating spaces of Russia’s Far East are even more likely to come under Chinese cultural, and eventually political, control. China may well eventually control parts of Siberia in the long run. Vladivostok, the largest Russian port on the Pacific Ocean, is ice-locked for about four months and is enclosed by the Sea of Japan, which is dominated by the Japanese. This does not just halt the flow of trade; it prevents the Russian fleet from operating as a global power. Sevastopol is Russia’s only true major warm-water port. Having annexed Crimea, the Russians are building up the Black Sea fleet at Sevastopol and constructing a new naval port in the Russian city of Novorossiysk, which, although it does not have a natural … strong enough to break out of the Black Sea during wartime. Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Russia is at a geographical disadvantage, saved from being a much weaker power only because of its oil and gas. When the Soviet Union broke apart, it split into fifteen countries. Geography had its revenge on the ideology of the Soviets, and a more logical picture reappeared on the map, one where mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas delineate where people live, how they are separated from each other and, thus, how they developed different languages and customs. The exception to this rule are the “stans,” such as Tajikistan, whose borders were deliberately drawn by Stalin so as to weaken each state by ensuring it had large minorities of people from other states. Russia also controls the central heating in the homes of the Baltic people. It can set the price people pay for their heating bills each month, and, if it chooses, simply turn the heating off. The cooling relationship between Russia and the West is already the New Cold War. 25 percent of Europe’s gas and oil comes from Russia; but often the closer a country is to Moscow, the greater its dependency. This in turn reduces that country’s foreign policy options. Latvia, Slovakia, Finland, and Estonia are 100 percent reliant on Russian gas; the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Lithuania are 80 percent dependent; and Greece, Austria, and Hungary 60 percent. The better your relations with Russia, the less you pay for energy. China is a civilization pretending to be a nation. Until now China has never been a naval power - with its large landmass, multiple borders. It had no need to be, and it was rarely ideologically expansive. The geopolitics of fear: If China did not control Tibet, it would always be possible that India might attempt to do so. This would give India the commanding heights of the Tibetan Plateau and a base from which to push into the Chinese heartland, as well as control of the Tibetan sources of three of China’s great rivers, the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong. Tibet is known as “China’s Water Tower.” “What is the impact of the French Revolution?” to which the prime minister replied, “It’s too soon to tell.” Why do you think your values would work in a culture you don’t understand? China also intends to become a two-ocean power (Pacific and Indian). To achieve this, China is investing in deep-water ports in Burma, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka In Europe, winter actually adds a bonus, with temperatures warm enough to work in but cold enough to kill off many of the germs. Europe’s major rivers do not meet. This partly explains why there are so many countries in what is a relatively small space. Because they do not connect, most of the rivers act, at some point, as boundaries. The contrast between northern and southern Europe is also at least partly attributable to the fact that the south has fewer coastal plains suitable for agriculture, and has suffered more from drought and natural disasters than the north. France is the only European country to be both a northern and southern power. Spain is also struggling, and has always struggled because of its geography. Its narrow coastal plains have poor soil, and access to markets is hindered internally by its short rivers and the Meseta Central. There are about 1,400 Greek islands. 200 are inhabited. It takes a decent navy just to patrol this territory, never mind one strong enough to deter any attempt to take the islands over. The result is a huge cost in military spending that Greece cannot afford. The Balkan countries’ mountainous terrain led to the emergence of so many small states in the region, and is one of the things that has kept them from integrating. EU was set up so that France and Germany could hug each other so tightly in a loving embrace that neither would be able to get an arm free with which to punch the other. Africa’s coastline? Great beaches - really, really lovely beaches - but terrible natural harbors. Rivers? Amazing rivers, but most of them are worthless for actually transporting anything, given that every few miles you go over a waterfall. These are just two in a long list of problems that helps explain why Africa isn’t technologically or politically as successful as Western Europe or North America. The Europeans then took maps of the contours of Africa’s geography and drew lines on them - or, to take a more aggressive approach, lies. The ethnic conflicts within Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Mali, and elsewhere are evidence that the European idea of geography did not fit the reality of Africa’s demographics. There may have always been conflict: the Zulus and Xhosas had their differences long before they had ever set eyes on a European. But colonialism forced those differences to be resolved within an artificial structure - the European concept of a nation state. The modern civil wars are now partially a result of the colonialists’ having told different nations that they were one nation in one state, and then after the colonialists were chased out, a dominant people emerged within the state who wanted to rule it all, thus ensuring violence. The notion that a man from a certain area could not travel across a region to see a relative from the same tribe unless he had a document, granted to him by a third man he didn’t know in a faraway town, made little sense. The idea that the document was issued because a foreigner had said the area was now two regions and had made up names for them. In 1916, the British diplomat Colonel Sir Mark Sykes took a grease pencil and drew a crude line across a map of the Middle East. It ran from Haifa on the Mediterranean in what is now Israel to Kirkuk (now in Iraq) in the northeast. It became the basis of his secret agreement with his French counterpart François Georges-Picot to divide the region into two spheres of influence should the Triple Entente defeat the Ottoman Empire in the First World War. North of the line was to be under French control, south of it under British hegemony. The term Sykes-Picot has become shorthand for the various decisions made in the first third of the twentieth century, which betrayed promises given to tribal leaders and which partially explains the unrest and extremism of today. This explanation can be overstated, though: there was violence and extremism before the Europeans arrived. One of the biggest failures of European line drawing lies in the center of the continent, the giant black hole known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo - the DRC. The DRC is not developing, nor does it show any signs of doing so. The DRC should never have been put together; it has fallen apart and is the most underreported war zone in the world, despite the fact that six million people have died there during wars that have been fought since the late 1990s. The DRC is neither democratic nor a republic. The people are divided into more than two hundred ethnic groups. Belgian colonial rule was ruthlessly brutal. The population lives in poverty. In 2014, the United Nations’ Human Development Index placed the DRC at number 186 out of 187 countries it measured. Egypt is the Nile, and the Nile is Egypt. Without the Nile, there would be no one there. It may be a huge country, but the vast majority of its 84 million population lives within a few miles of the Nile. There are hardly any trees in Egypt, and for most of history, if you didn’t have trees you couldn’t build a great navy. Ethiopia is sometimes called Africa’s water tower, due to its high elevation, and has more than twenty dams fed by the rainfall in its highlands. In 2011, Addis Ababa announced a joint project with China to build a massive hydroelectric project on the Blue Nile near the Sudanese border called the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, scheduled to be finished by 2020. The dam will be used to create electricity, and the flow to Egypt should continue; but in theory the dam could also hold a year’s worth of water, and completion of the project would give Ethiopia the potential to hold the water for its own use, thus drastically reducing the flow into Egypt. As things stand, Egypt has a more powerful military, but that is slowly changing, and Ethiopia, a country of 96 million people, is a growing power. Cairo knows this, and also that, once the dam is built, destroying it would create a flooding catastrophe in both Ethiopia and Sudan. Water wars are considered to be among the imminent conflicts this century, and this is one to watch. Angola is second only to Saudi Arabia as the biggest supplier of crude oil to China. Chinese are everywhere, they mean business, and they are now every bit as involved across Africa as the Europeans and Americans. Chinese involvement is an attractive proposition for many African governments. Beijing and the big Chinese companies don’t ask difficult questions about human rights, and they don’t demand economic reform or even suggest that certain African leaders stop stealing their countries’ wealth, as the IMF or World Bank might. South Africa is more developed than many African nations, thanks to its location at the very southern tip of the continent with access to two oceans; its natural wealth of gold, silver, and coal; and a climate and land that allow for large-scale food production. South Africa is one of the very few African countries that do not suffer from the curse of malaria, as mosquitoes find it difficult to breed there. The Arabian Desert is the largest continuous sand desert in the world, incorporating an area the size of France. The most important division within Islam is almost as old as the religion itself: the split between Sunni and Shia Muslims dates back to 632 CE, when the prophet Muhammad died, leading to a dispute over his succession. The Sunni Muslims form the majority - 85 percent of the total. Upon the death of the prophet, those who would become Sunni argued that his successor should be chosen using Arab tribal traditions. They regard themselves as Orthodox Muslims. The name Shia derives from shiat Ali, literally “the party of Ali,” and refers to the son-in-law of the prophet Muhammad. Ali and his sons, Hassan and Hussein, were all assassinated and thus denied what the Shia feel was their birthright - to lead the Islamic community. From this sprang several doctrinal disputes and cultural practices dividing the two main branches of Islam that have led to disputes and warfare, although there have also been long periods of peaceful coexistence. There are also divisions within the division. Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra. In antiquity, the regions very roughly corresponding to the above were known as Assyria, Babylonia, and Sumer. When the Persians controlled the space they divided it in a similar way, as did Alexander the Great, and later the Umayyad dynasty. The British looked at the same area and divided the three into one, a logical impossibility Christians can resolve through the Holy Trinity, but which in Iraq has resulted in an “unholy” mess. Many analysts say that only a strong man could unite these three areas into one country, and Iraq had one strong man after another. But in reality the people were never unified; they were only frozen with fear. The Kashmir issue is partially one of national pride, but it is also strategic. Full control of Kashmir would give India a window into central Asia and a border with Afghanistan. It would also deny Pakistan a border with China and thus diminish the usefulness of a Chinese-Pakistani relationship. China wanted Tibet, both to prevent India from having it, and to prevent an independent Tibet allowing India to base military forces there. The Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh: China claims it as “south Tibet.” As China’s confidence grows, so does the amount of territory there it says is Chinese. N + S Korea: The economic costs of reunification will be borne by South Korea. The costs would hold back the economy of a united peninsula for a decade, risking the prosperity of one of the world’s most advanced nations. Japan: three-quarters of the land is not conducive to human habitation. This leaves the Japanese living in close proximity to one another along the coastal plains. Its mountains mean that Japan has plenty of water, but its rivers are unsuited to navigation and therefore trade, a problem exacerbated by the fact that few of the rivers join one another. So the Japanese became a maritime people, connecting and trading along the coasts. Japan is the world’s largest importer of natural gas, and the third-largest importer of oil. It was the thirst for these products, notably iron and oil, that caused Japan to rampage across the far-less developed Southeast Asia. It occupied Taiwan in 1895 and followed this up with the annexation of Korea in 1910. Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931, then conducted a full-scale invasion of China in 1937. Japan's previous belligerence and militarism is not entirely gone: just been buried beneath the rubble of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and a shattered national psyche. Slowly the Japanese Self-Defense Forces were turned into a modern fighting unit. Americans, realizing they were going to need military allies in the Pacific region, were prepared to accept a remilitarized Japan. Latin America’s European settlers stayed near the coasts, so all roads from the interior were developed to connect to the capitals but not to one another. The colonialists concentrated on getting the wealth out of each region, to the coast and on to foreign markets. Even after independence the predominantly European coastal elites failed to invest in the interior, and what population centers there are inland remain poorly connected with one another. Latin America: there’s a lot going on all over this vast space, but the problem is much of it is going on a long way from anywhere other than itself. Bolivia and Chile: Particularly bitter relationship. In 1879 Bolivia lost a large chunk of its territory, including 250 miles of coastline, and has been landlocked ever since. It has never recovered from this blow, which partially explains why it is among the poorest Latin American countries. This in turn has exacerbated the severe divide between the mostly European lowlands population and the mostly indigenous peoples of the highlands. Despite the fact that Bolivia has the third-largest reserves of natural gas in South America it will not sell any to Chile, which is in need of a reliable supplier. The borders of the British territory of Belize and neighboring Guatemala. They are straight lines, drawn by the British. South America is in effect a demographically hollow continent. Mexico: populations are more equally distributed. Before the 1846–48 war with the United States the land that is now Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona was part of Mexico. The conflict led to half of Mexico’s territory being ceded to the United States. The Nicaragua Grand Canal project is funded by a Hong Kong businessman adamant that the Chinese government not be involved. The cost estimate is four times the size of the entire Nicaraguan economy. There will be only one bridge across the canal along its entire length. Nicaragua is the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. China has now replaced the United States as Brazil’s main trading partner, and may do the same with several other Latin American countries. The Latin American countries do not have a natural affinity with the United States. The United States used force in Latin America almost fifty times between 1890 and the end of the Cold War. Brazil’s seven largest ports combined can handle fewer goods per year than the single American port of New Orleans. 25 percent of Brazilians live in the favela slums. If the letters had not spelled what sounds like a word, then the BRICS theory would not have caught on. Argentina is better placed to become a First World country than is Brazil. Control of the flat agricultural regions of the Rio de la Plata, the navigable river system, and therefore the commerce that flows down it toward Buenos Aires and its port. This is among the most valuable pieces of real estate on the whole continent. It gives Argentina an economic and strategic advantage. But its leadership has botched that natural advantage so far. The Brazilians have a joke about their snobbish neighbors, as they see them: “Only people this sophisticated could make a mess this big.” The Arctic: a place destined to be a diplomatic battleground in the twenty-first century as countries great and small strive to reach pole position there. Who has the force? The Russians. No one else has such a heavy presence in the region or is as well prepared to tackle the severity of the conditions. Arctic comes from the Greek arktikos, which means “near the bear,” and is a reference to the Ursa Major constellation, whose last two stars point toward the North Star. The Arctic region includes land in parts of Canada, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States (Alaska). The North Pole: even though there is a fixed point on the globe denoting its position, below it, the ice you are standing on is moving, and without GPS equipment it is hard to tell exactly where you are. The melting of the ice cap already allows cargo ships to make the journey through the Northwest Passage in the Canadian archipelago for several summer weeks a year, thus cutting at least a week from the transit time from Europe to China. The first cargo ship not to be escorted by an icebreaker went through in 2014. The polar route was 40 percent shorter and used deeper waters than if it had gone through the Panama Canal. By 2040, the route is expected to be open for up to two months each year, Arctic: Norway knows what is coming and has made the High North its foreign policy priority. Its air force regularly intercepts Russian fighter jets approaching its borders; the heightened tensions have caused it to move its center of military operations from the south of the country to the north, and it is building an Arctic battalion.","The world's cultures and politics are this way because of geography : oceans, rivers, mountains, deserts, farmable land, etc. Fascinating for me because I'd never looked at this world this way before."
Finland Culture Shock,Deborah Swallow,076145506X,7,"The Finns themselves joke that of all the EU rules, they obey 120 per cent of them. How do you get a Finn to talk? Put a phone in his hand. You will not be ‘sold to’. This will be seen as being an invasion of your privacy and an interruption of your personal silence. Finns are not Scandinavians, nor are they Slavs. There are more lakes in Finland than in any other country in the world. Overall happiness: Finland ranks 6th in the world. Finland has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation. Finland is the most heavily wooded country in Europe, covering 72 per cent of its lands. 63 per cent of the forests are in the hands of private owners, which equates to one in five families being owners. Sisu: meaning guts, toughness, stamina, courage, stubbornness. Doing things until they’re done. Values are borne of a cultural mindset, developed through taught and learned national concepts which become core beliefs. Culture is the total of the inherited ideas, beliefs, values and knowledge which constitute the shared bases of social action. It is the ideas of a group with shared traditions and the tastes valued by that group. Culture is a social and psychological prism: We think we perceive the world as it is. In fact the world is mediated through our dominant assumptions, values, and beliefs. Our cultural prism determines how we understand and know ourselves, others, and the world. Each of our cultural prisms is built out of a history of our group, our religions and other belief systems, economies, educational and legal systems, aesthetics, language, and to some extent our geography. It is the embedded psychological reality of a group and how it affects thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Every culture distinguishes itself from others by the way they react to certain situations. Individual or community spirited: The Finns lie between these two extremes, being very individualistic but having a social conscience, thus they have heavy taxation. They perceive themselves as fiercely individualistic, but (as we say in English) they won’t rock the boat because of what the neighbours might say, as this will make them stand out from the crowd. In Japan, individual thinking is a sign of immaturity, demonstrating that a person has not grown up enough to put societal values first. Sticking to the rules or bending rules: The Finns lie at the ‘sticking to the rule’ extreme. Given status versus achievement: This is the degree to which a society gives recognition for attributes such as age or birth right, versus recognition for one’s own personal and individual achievements. Finns are definitely achievement oriented - defined as academic achievement, innovation and entrepreneurship. Very little credence is given to celebrities. Equality versus hierarchy: Finns believe in total equality. Cool and calm versus emotional behaviour: This is the degree to which a society tolerates the expression and use of emotion (especially in decision-making and business). When an Italian is in love, the whole world knows - likewise when s/he is angry. Finns are suspicious of melodrama, which confuses them, and secretly believe that people showing this disposition are untrustworthy. They admire coolness and calm judgement. As emotion has no place in their daily, operational lives - facts do. Facts, evidence and truth are believed to produce the best outcome, and truth is very black and white in Finland - there are absolutely no shades of grey. Attitudes to time: people arrive punctually Environmental consciousness: This is the degree to which people either abuse their environment, versus being a part of the cosmos system and ecologically aware. The Finns are forest people at heart. A boss said Finns are the only people he knows where he can give them an exercise to do, return in 15 minutes, and find that the exercise will be completed. If there is a job to be done, they just get on and do it with no small talk to interrupt. National trait of obeying the rules. Finland is one of the lowest debt-ridden countries in the EU (and industrialised nations). Finns pay faster than any other country. In Finland, your word is your bond - a statement is like a promise. A handshake on a deal is as good as a written contract. You say EXACTLY what you mean, and mean EXACTLY what you say. This means the Finns direct communication approach can seem rather rude to other cultures used to ‘softening’. Chattiness is a sign of empty-headedness. Few have too much and even fewer have too little. Without the existence of an overseas empire, or a native monarchy and aristocracy, there has been no opportunity for racial, social or class superiority to take root. Most of them work with their heads. Labour jobs have been transferred to China or Estonia. Political summits are held in Helsinki as Finland is seen as a country with ‘no axe to grind’ and no historical alliances. Survey of 50 countries shows that the Finnish and New Zealand males are the least susceptible to flattery. In 1990, there were only 9,000 foreigners in the whole of Finland, The law in Finland requires all major employers to provide a ‘Nuclear’ Bunker, stocked with provisions, water and blankets at their premises for the protection of their workforce in case of an emergency. To understand the Finns’ need for personal space, you have to realise that until modern recent history, most Finns lived a simple life by fishing, hunting and cultivating the land. With so few people and such an expanse of land, this life was very lonely and often the only contact with people were with the family that lived with them. The vast majority of the Finns live in towns but they still remain a ‘forest people’. They love to be in close harmony with nature, and it has to be understood that sometimes Finns just like to be alone. When my (first or second) name is repeatedly mentioned when someone talks to me - a habit of especially American (US) salesmen - I feel pushed and my personal space violated. A quarter of the population of Finland owns a summer cottage - there are about 400,000 of them. Normally there is no electricity or running water, but the two things that a mokki has to have are a sauna and a rowing boat. From a Finnish reader: I spent two months in England to learn the language when I was 17. The place was not a big city, but even so I felt very clear distress when I realised that there is never a place or a moment when I can be alone. In the parks and beaches and everywhere, there is always a bigger or smaller crowd around me. Problems: It was the first Western country to notice the disastrous affects of the Chernobyl catastrophe. This meant that hundreds of reindeer had to be slaughtered. It suffers from air and water pollution arising from the activities of its Russian neighbour. The Finnish flag is supposed to represent the white of the snow and the blue lakes of summer. Nine out of ten Finns belong to the national Lutheran Church. Finns do not necessarily consider themselves religious, but they feel comfortable belonging to an organised church. Finland had the first women in the world to vote along with New Zealand. There is no culture of traditional ‘women’s jobs’. About 30 per cent of entrepreneurs are women. Finnish women are better educated than the men. Women are seen as popular and successful in their role as a boss. Finland has reduced its incidence of heart attacks by 75 per cent since the early 1970s. According to UNICEF’s report on the well-being of children in industrialised nations: Finnish children are the healthiest in all of Europe. The worst, in descending order, were Portugal, Austria, Hungary, USA, and last Britain. The essence of effective cross-cultural communication has more to do with releasing the right responses than with sending the ‘right’ message. People often take their shoes off indoors and in public. On the aeroplane, in training rooms or even in business meetings, shoes will be slipped off without any self-consciousness. The Finns are a very tolerant people. This is derived from their value-set of leaving people alone and respecting people’s privacy. However, they will not tolerate lateness - of anything. A Finnish reader: ‘In the States, an elderly women saw me sitting on a bench and said to me “Your shoes are so cute!” I was taken aback and thought she was so rude. Why should this complete stranger have the right to make value judgements about my dress, and why should she think I’d care? After all, I liked my shoes (that’s why I was wearing them) and why should anyone else’s comments matter to me? Scandal - the Finns don’t ‘do scandal’. Because the Finnish view of what is considered normal in life is quite broad, there seems very little to gossip about. Finns will give you quite a lot of information that, in other cultures, may be considered embarrassing or private, as these things are just considered normal things that people experience in life. Finnish logic tells them it is therefore not embarrassing or particularly private; your parents’ divorce, illness in the family, breaking up, having difficulty deciding career path etc., are very openly talked about. The responsibility of defining what can be talked about lies with the answerer. Finns joke they are good at being silent in two languages - Finnish and Swedish. Finnish women, wanting to be romanced or entertained, live in frustration at their silent partners. Finland has the highest consumption of coffee per capita of anywhere in the world. The Finnish identity is based on places and ancestors rather than on work and career. The Finns have a nasty little expression for something that doesn’t have any value: “This isn’t from anywhere!” (Tämä ei ole mistään kotoisin). In most countries it’s considered polite to communicate. In Finland it’s polite to leave people alone. One of the knock-on effects of such generous state subsidies is that students will sign up for university and stay there. The majority of young people sign up for Masters degrees and it is very unusual for people to get a degree just at Bachelors level. Currently, the majority of students stay an average of seven to eight years at university. They like to pay their own way. As the Finns would say, “I don’t like to travel on your wing”. In other words, they don’t like to be beholden to anybody else. Finns never drink in rounds. Everyone always pays for their own beer, and buys it when they want, even when drinking with friends. Finns seem to eat as quickly as they can and get up from the table as soon as they are finished. One of the best ways to understand a nation is to learn something about who they respect and worship. Who are their heroes? Who are seen as role models for the nation’s children? Who are the people who hand down tradition or guidance, values and direction? Then find out what they do. How do they spend their leisure time? What is the most popular leisure activity or hobby? What do they become fanatical about? How musical are they? What art do they appreciate? Finally, you could travel around the country and see the sites and understand how a nation’s geography has shaped their culture. In Finnish, computer is tietokone (knowledge machine) and telephone is puhelin (to do with speech). Every letter in a word is pronounced, The absence of gender: The same Finnish pronoun han means both he and she. Finnish sayings: Love makes you blind; marriage opens your eyes wide. Behave in the sauna as you would in a church. Closeness without conflict only exists in the cemetery. There is no word for ‘please’ in Finnish.","Surprisingly insightful. Much better than expected. An outsider’s insights into Finnish culture. I read it on my way to Finland, and swooned at the description of what sound like my kind of people. My experience in Finland mostly matches the book’s description, except I was in louder central Helsinki, so the anti-social silence was not on display. The book has a list of spectrums of culture which could be a good framework to categorize various countries’ cultures."
Watching the English,Kate Fox,185788616X,7,"No, I am not going to get beyond the stereotypes, I am going to try to get inside them. Conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all: English weather-speak is a form of code, evolved to help us overcome our natural reserve and actually talk. ‘Ooh, isn’t it cold?’ – like ‘Nice day, isn’t it?’ and all the others – is English code for ‘I’d like to talk to you – will you talk to me?’, or, if you like, simply another way of saying ‘hello’. The reciprocity is the point, not the content. Never contradict anybody when discussing the weather. The Shipping Forecast is a cold poetry of information. The English do not want to know your name, or tell you theirs, until a much greater degree of intimacy has been established. The object is to drift casually into conversation, as though by accident. To be impeccably English, one must perform these rituals badly. One must appear self-conscious, ill-at-ease, stiff, awkward and, above all, embarrassed. The ‘print exception’: writers are allowed bare their soul in writing. But just as you would not ask a professional topless model to take her top off at a family Sunday lunch, so you do not ask professional soul-barers to bare their souls over the canapés at a private party. Earnestness is not allowed; zeal is unmanly. Seriousness is acceptable, solemnity is prohibited. Sincerity is allowed, earnestness is strictly forbidden. Pomposity and self-importance are outlawed. ‘Oh, come off it!’ is a strong candidate for England’s national catchphrase. This may be why the English have satire instead of revolutions. The ‘Oh, come off it!’ rule encapsulates a peculiarly English blend of armchair cynicism, ironic detachment, a squeamish distaste for sentimentality, a stubborn refusal to be duped or taken in by fine rhetoric, and a mischievous delight in pin-pricking the balloons of pomposity and self-importance. When we ask someone a straightforward question (e.g. ‘How are the children?’), we are equally prepared for either a straightforward response (‘Fine, thanks.’) or an ironic one (‘Oh, they’re delightful – charming, helpful, tidy, studious …’ To which the reply is ‘Oh dear. Been one of those days, has it?’). The English are always in a state of readiness for humour. The understatement rule: Rather than risk exhibiting any hint of forbidden solemnity, unseemly emotion or excessive zeal, we go to the opposite extreme and feign dry, deadpan indifference. We are parodying ourselves. Every understatement is a little private joke about Englishness. Deal with the embarrassment of success and prestige by making a self-denigrating joke out of it all. If you do have the misfortune to be financially successful, it is bad manners to draw attention to the fact. You must play down your success, and appear ashamed of your wealth. The kind of anthropology I do is not far removed from stand-up comedy: pithy, acute, clever observation on the minutiae of human behaviour and social relations. The English are very much a verbal rather than a visual culture. Reliance on linguistic signals, and the irrelevance of wealth and occupation as class indicators, also reminds us that our culture is not a meritocracy. The bar counter is the only place in England in which anything is sold without the formation of a queue. There is in fact a queue, an invisible queue, and that both the bar staff and the customers are aware of each person’s position in this queue. Everyone knows who is next. It is not customary in English pubs to tip the bar staff who serve you. Instead, ‘And will you have one yourself?’ at the end of your order. The offer must be clearly phrased as a question, not an instruction, and should be made discreetly. It implies that the bartender is being included in the ‘round’. Identifiably English: the celebration of eccentricity, the constant undercurrent of humour, the wit and linguistic inventiveness. In the pub, sticking to the same subject for more than a few minutes may be taken as a sign of excessive seriousness. Free-association: attempts to focus on a particular subject for more than a few minutes are fruitless, and only serve to make one unpopular. Pubgoers do not pour their hearts out to each other; they do not reveal – except inadvertently – their private fears or secret desires. In fact, it is not done to talk about ‘personal’ matters at all, unless such matters can be aired in a non-serious manner. Earnest heart-to-heart outpourings are frowned upon. Moaning is English ‘polite egalitarianism’, a less invidious form of hypocrisy. The moaners, by emphasising the mundane practical details and difficulties of home-buying or moving, are focusing on problems they and their listeners have in common, matters with which we can all identify, and politely deflecting attention from any potentially embarrassing disparity in wealth. One of the most important rules of moaning: you must moan in a relatively good-humoured, light-hearted manner. However genuinely grumpy you may be feeling, this must be disguised as mock-grumpiness. The Germans live in Germany; The Romans live in Rome; The Turkeys live in Turkey; But the English live at home. Negative politeness is concerned with other people’s need not to be intruded or imposed upon - as opposed to ‘positive politeness’, which is concerned with their need for inclusion. What looks like unfriendliness is really a kind of consideration: we assume that everyone shares our obsessive need for privacy – so we mind our own business and politely ignore them. Visitors from ‘positive-politeness’ cultures are more likely to misunderstand and be offended by the ‘polite’ aloofness. ‘Sorry’ is a useful, versatile, all-purpose word, suitable for all occasions and circumstances. It is not a considered admission of guilt. The determinedly unpatriotic English object to my more positive findings about them. The English have some pleasant and even admirable qualities. The English themselves just cannot seem to accept this. English social interaction: We seem to be congenitally incapable of being frank, clear or assertive. We are always oblique, always playing some complex, convoluted game. The top and bottom ends of the social scale have more in common with each other than either has with the middle ranks. The common factor usually turns out to be some form of disregard for social niceties or a lack of concern about ‘what the neighbours will think’. The majority of the more notable and flamboyant English eccentrics have always come from either the highest or the lowest social classes. What looks like anti-intellectualism is often in fact a combination of anti-earnestness and anti-boastfulness. We don’t mind people being ‘brainy’ or clever, as long as they don’t make a big song-and-dance about it, don’t preach or pontificate at us, don’t show off and don’t take themselves too seriously. Workplace encounters: there is always an awkward period – usually lasting around five to ten minutes, but it can take up to twenty – in which all or some of the parties feel that it would be rude to start ‘talking business’ straight away, and everyone tries to pretend that this is really just a friendly social gathering. A visiting Canadian businessman complained: “I suggested maybe we could get started on the contract and they all looked at me like I’d farted or something! Like, how could I be so crass?” The English find ‘doing business’ awkward and embarrassing at least partly because of a deep-seated but utterly irrational distaste for money-talk of any kind. It is best to do all the financial negotiating in letters or emails. The English just can’t talk about money face to face, you have to do it in writing. In writing they’re fine – they don’t have to look you in the eye and they don’t have to say all those dirty words out loud. Yorkshire: a county that prides itself on being forthright, blunt and plain-spoken, especially on matters that mincing, hesitant southerners find embarrassing, such as money. Blunt Yorkshiremen know that they are turning the rules upside-down: they do it on purpose. In England, money will buy you a lot of things, including access to power and influence, but it will not buy you any respect – quite the opposite: social class is completely independent of material wealth. People use ‘work hard, play hard’ to describe their exciting lifestyle and their dynamic approach to work and leisure. They are almost always lying. The English, on the whole, do not ‘work hard and play hard’: we do both, and most other things, in moderation. Our relative freedom from the corruption they felt was endemic and tacitly accepted in other parts of the world. ‘You just take it for granted,’ a Polish immigrant complained. ‘You assume that people will play fair, and you are shocked and upset when they do not. In other countries there is not that assumption.’ ‘Typical!’ is a generic, all-purpose term of disapproval. It is a complaint, but a complaint that also expresses a very English kind of grudging forbearance and restraint – a sort of grumpy, cynical stoicism. If you ever find that a business discussion is somewhat stilted, over-formal or heavy going, ask the person to ‘just talk as though we were in the pub,’ or ‘tell me about it as you would if we were in the pub.’ Everyone will know exactly what you mean: pub-talk is relaxed, informal, friendly talk, not trying to impress, not taking things too seriously. Latin-Mediterranean = insouciant fatalism. Anti-intellectualism looks awfully like ‘empiricism’, particularly the anti-theory, anti-dogma, anti-abstraction elements of the English empiricist tradition, our stolid preference for the factual, concrete and common-sense, and deep mistrust of obscurantist, ‘Continental’ theorising and rhetoric. Home is what the English have instead of social skills. Our love-affair with our homes is directly related to our obsession with privacy, which in turn is due to our social dis-ease. The term ‘Guardian-reader’ is often used as shorthand for a woolly, lefty, politically correct, knit-your-own-tofu sort of person. Shopping is not an act of spending, but an act of saving. You do not speak of having ‘spent’ x amount on an item of food or clothing, but of having ‘saved’ x amount on the item. You would certainly never boast about having spent an excessive sum of money on something, but you are allowed to take pride in finding a bargain. This rule applies across all social classes. Always praise people’s pets, and when you speak to our animals directly (which you should do as much as possible) remember that you are addressing our inner child. The rest of the world is not as socially inhibited and inept as the English. We do not find it easy to initiate friendly conversation with strangers, or to develop closer relationships with fellow pubgoers. We need help. We need props. We need excuses to make contact. We need toys and sports and games that get us involved with each other. On average ‘initiating’ round-buyers (those who regularly buy the first round) actually spend no more money in the long term than ‘waiting’ round-buyers (those who do not offer a round until later in the session). In fact, far from being out-of-pocket, ‘initiators’ often end up rather better off than those who wait, because their popularity and reputation for generosity means that others are inclined to be generous towards them. When people think they are drinking alcohol, they behave according to their cultural beliefs about the behavioural effects of alcohol. In some societies (such as the UK, the US, Australia and parts of Scandinavia), drinking is associated with aggression, violence and anti-social behaviour, while in others (such as Latin/Mediterranean cultures) drinking behaviour is largely peaceful and harmonious. To prove to their companions that they have attained the socially desirable degree of drunkenness, they generally feel obliged to do something ‘mad’ – to put on some sort of display of outrageously disinhibited behaviour. By blaming the booze, we sidestep the uncomfortable question of why the English, so widely admired for their courtesy, reserve and restraint, should also be renowned for their oafishness, crudeness and violence. We suffer from deeply ingrained inhibitions that make it difficult for us to express emotion and engage in the kind of casual, friendly social interaction that seems to come naturally to most other nations. Opposite extremes: when we feel uncomfortable or embarrassed in social situations we become either over-polite, courteous, buttoned-up and awkwardly restrained, or loud, loutish, aggressive, violent and generally insufferable. We disguise our craving for social contact as a burning desire to throw balls at each other, or to perfect our flower-arranging or motorcycle-maintenance skills, or to save the whales, or the world, or something – and then go to the pub, where we can pretend that we are only there for the beer, and attribute any embarrassing evidence of normal human emotion to its miraculous properties. One should not be seen to be overly concerned about being fashionable or well dressed. Dress, like pretty much everything else, is not to be taken too seriously. Dress is essentially a form of communication – one could even call it a social skill – so perhaps it should not be surprising to find that the socially challenged English are not terribly good at it. We do not like formality; we object to being dictated to by prissy little rules and regulations – but we lack the natural grace and social ease to cope with informality. Food is not given high priority in English life. We have no great culinary tradition of our own. In Italy, they are much more traditional, much less open-minded about food. And the French are even more narrow-minded. But we can be remarkably flexible, willing to try new things and absorb different culinary practices. Indian food in particular is now an integral part of English culture. The English just don’t really expect things to work properly and don’t expect particularly good service or products, and when their pessimistic assumptions are confirmed they say, “Huh! Typical!”’ But we never DO anything about it except sit around saying “Typical!” to each other. We do tend to treat such failings as though they were acts of God, rather than instances of human incompetence. When we say ‘Typical!’ we are expressing annoyance and resentment, but we are also, in some strange way, pleased that our gloomy predictions and cynical assumptions about the ways of the world have been proved accurate. We may have been thwarted and inconvenienced, but we have not been taken unawares. We knew this would happen. We always choose the slowest queue; deliveries are always late; builders never finish a job properly, something always goes wrong, and on top of that it’s bound to rain. To the English, these are established, incontrovertible facts. Unless you fully appreciate this peculiar mindset and its implications you will never truly understand the English. Try repeating the above mantras to yourself every day. Recite them in a resignedly cheerful tone, adding the odd ‘mustn’t grumble’ or ‘never mind’ or ‘better make the best of it’, and you will be well on your way to becoming English. Learn to greet every problem, from a piece of burnt toast to World War Three, with ‘Typical!’, somehow managing to sound simultaneously peeved, stoical and smugly omniscient, and you will qualify as a fully acculturated English person. Food taboos have become the primary means of defining one’s social identity. You are what you do not eat. The working classes generally have no truck with this sort of nonsense. They have real problems, and do not need to invent fancy food allergies to make their lives more interesting. The upper classes are equally down-to-earth and sceptical about such matters. They do not suffer from the same insecurities about their identity as the fretful middle classes, and so do not need to define themselves through conspicuous non-consumption. What do you call your evening meal? And at what time do you eat it? If you call it ‘tea’, and eat it at around half past six, you are almost certainly working class. If you call the evening meal ‘dinner’, and eat it at around seven o’clock, you are probably lower-middle or middle-middle. If you normally only use the term ‘dinner’ for rather more formal evening meals, and call your informal, family evening meal ‘supper’, you are probably upper-middle or upper class. A family ‘supper’ is generally eaten at around half-past seven, while a ‘dinner’ would usually be later, from half past eight onwards. To everyone but the working classes, ‘tea’ is a light meal taken at around four o’clock in the afternoon, and consists of tea (the drink) with cakes, scones, jam, biscuits and perhaps little sandwiches – traditionally including cucumber sandwiches – with the crusts cut off. The working classes call this ‘afternoon tea’, to distinguish it from the evening ‘tea’ that the rest call supper or dinner. Everyone has lunch at around one o’clock. The English do not take the middle-of-the-day meal at all seriously: most make do with a sandwich or some other quick, easy, single-dish meal. Tea-making is the perfect displacement activity: when in doubt, put the kettle on. Almost all eating is supposed to be done with both knife and fork. Almost all foods must be speared and/or squashed onto the backs of forks. Only first courses and salads, for example, or spaghetti or shepherd’s pie – may be eaten with the fork alone. Cut up and eat foods one small piece at a time. ‘Small is beautiful’ and ‘slow is beautiful’ principles seem to be at the root of many of the class-indicator rules. Break off (not cut off) a bite-sized piece of the bread or toast, spread butter/pâté/marmalade onto just that small piece, eat it in one small bite, then repeat the procedure with another small piece. It is considered vulgar to spread butter or whatever across the whole slice of toast and then bite into it. Fillet the fish one small bit at a time. Grapes must be broken off in a small bunch, and eaten one at a time. Apples and other fruit are peeled, quartered and eaten one segment at a time, not bitten into whole. Bananas should be peeled and cut into discs, which are then eaten one at a time. Class-indicator rules are designed to slow us down, to make things deliberately difficult, to ensure that we eat the smallest possible mouthfuls. What it all boils down to is not appearing to be greedy. Over-eagerness about anything is undignified; over-eagerness about food is disgusting. Napkin: gentle dabbing. The napkin should be left carelessly crumpled on the table. You are supposed to dip your fingers briefly in the finger bowl, then pat them gently dry with your napkin – not wash and scrub and rub as though it were a bathroom sink. Port must always travel round the table clockwise. You must always pass the bottle or decanter to your left. Why do we find sex so funny? We don’t, not really: it’s just that humour is our standard way of dealing with anything that makes us feel uncomfortable or embarrassed.","The first book I read about a country’s philosophy, and still one of the best. (Au Contraire, about the French, is the other.) I re-read it now 11 years later, and loved her insights and writing. Active anthropology. A must-read if you’re spending time in England."
The Lessons of History,Will and Ariel Durant,115742427,7,"Learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another’s delusions. To the geologic eye, the surface of the earth is a fluid form. Competition is not only the life of trade, it is the trade of life. Co-operation is a tool and form of competition. We co-operate in our group to strengthen our group in its competition with other groups. Our countries, being ourselves multiplied, are what we are. They write our natures in bolder type. War is a nation’s way of eating. Freedom and equality are enemies, and when one prevails the other dies. Leave men free, and their natural inequalities will multiply. A society in which all potential abilities are allowed to develop and function will have a survival advantage in the competition of groups. History shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind. The Greeks of Plato’s time behaved very much like the French of modern centuries, and the Romans behaved like the English. Out of every hundred new ideas ninety-nine or more will probably be inferior to the traditional responses which they propose to replace. These are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history. So the conservative who resists change is as valuable as the radical who proposes it - perhaps as much more valuable as roots are more vital than grafts. It is good that new ideas should be heard, for the sake of the few that can be used. But it is also good that new ideas should be compelled to go through the mill of objection. A little knowledge of history stresses the variability of moral codes. A larger knowledge stresses the universality of moral codes, and concludes to their necessity. The rebellious youth is no longer constrained by the surveillance of the village. He can hide in the protective anonymity of the city crowd. History as usually written is quite different from history as usually lived. The historian records the exceptional because it is interesting. Nature and history do not agree with our conceptions of good and bad. They define good as that which survives, and bad as that which goes under. Puritanism and paganism - the repression and the expression of the senses and desires - alternate in mutual reaction in history. Generally religion and puritanism prevail in periods when the laws are feeble and morals must bear the burden of maintaining social order. Skepticism and paganism progress as the rising power of law and government permits the decline of the church, the family, and morality without basically endangering the stability of the state. The men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things. The men who can manage money manage all. History is inflationary. Do not hoard money. Every economic system must sooner or later rely upon some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. Substitutes like slavery, police supervision, or ideological enthusiasm prove too unproductive, too expensive, or too transient. The concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution. In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation. The freedom of individuals in society requires some regulation of conduct. The first condition of freedom is its limitation. In most instances the effects achieved by the revolution would apparently have come without it, through the gradual compulsion of economic developments. As the sanity of the individual lies in the continuity of his memories, so the sanity of a group lies in the continuity of its traditions. In either case a break in the chain invites a neurotic reaction. Civilization is a social order promoting cultural creation. Civilizations begin, flourish, decline, and disappear - or linger on as stagnant pools left by once life-giving streams. Homer has more readers now than in his own day and land. The essence of art and civilization is the replacement of chaos with order. Progress is the increasing control of the environment by life. Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew. If the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again. Education is the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage - for the enlargement of man’s understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life.","They wrote the massive 11-volume 10,000-page “Story of Civilization” covering Western history, then wrote this tiny 100-page book succinctly summing up its lessons for our present day."
When,Daniel Pink,125112724,7,"Positive affect: rose in the morning, plummeted in the afternoon, and climbed back up again in the early evening. The Mimosa pudica’s leaves opened in the morning, closed in the evening. The plant wasn’t reacting to external light. It was abiding by its own internal clock. Sharp-minded analytic capacities peak in the late morning or around noon. Having math in the first two periods of the school day instead of the last two periods increases the math GPA of students. Insight problems require less vigilance and fewer inhibitions. Innovation and creativity are greatest when we are not at our best. The fit between a person’s chronotype and the time of day offers a more complete predictor of that person’s ethicality than does time of day alone. All of us experience the day in three stages - a peak, a trough, and a rebound. And about three-quarters of us (larks and third birds) experience it in that order. But about one in four people, those whose genes or age make them night owls, experience the day in something closer to the reverse order - recovery, trough, peak. About 62 percent of the creators followed the peak-trough-recovery pattern, where serious heads-down work happened in the morning followed by not much work at all, and then a shorter burst of less taxing work. About 20 percent of the sample displayed the reverse pattern - recovering in the mornings and getting down to business much later in the day. Morning exercise may burn 20 percent more fat than later, post-food workouts. Testosterone levels peak in the morning. Testosterone helps build muscle, so if you’re doing weight training, schedule your workout for those early-morning hours. But for later-in-the-day workouts, our muscles are warmer and injuries are less common. Working out in the afternoons not only means that you’re less likely to get injured, it also helps you sprint faster and lift more. Lung function is highest this time of the day, so your circulation system can distribute more oxygen and nutrients. This is also the time of day when strength peaks, reaction time quickens, hand-eye coordination sharpens, and heart rate and blood pressure drop. A twenty- to thirty-minute break “to eat, play, and chat” before a test: their scores did not decline. In fact, they increased. If there were a break after every hour, test scores would actually improve over the course of the day. If we stick with a task too long, we lose sight of the goal. Frequent short breaks are more effective than occasional ones. Work for fifty-two minutes and then break for seventeen minutes. Take hourly five-minute walking breaks. Being close to trees, plants, rivers, and streams is a powerful mental restorative. An afternoon nap expands the brain’s capacity to learn. Ideal naps are between ten and twenty minutes. Caffeine, followed by a nap of ten to twenty minutes, is the ideal. January 1 is what social scientists call a “temporal landmark.” Just as human beings rely on landmarks to navigate space - “To get to my house, turn left at the Shell station” - we also use landmarks to navigate time. Certain dates stand out and their prominence helps us find our way. We can use them to construct better beginnings. The “fresh start effect”: Days that represent “firsts” switch on people’s motivation. To demarcate the passage of time, to end one period and begin another with a clean slate. The same way that a business closes the books at the end of one fiscal year and opens a fresh ledger for the new year. This new period offers a chance to start again by relegating our old selves to the past. It disconnects us from that past self’s mistakes and imperfections, and leaves us confident about our new, superior selves. When people take a big picture view of their lives and thus focus on achieving their goals. Start acting on days framed as fresh starts. Meatless Mondays will be far more effective than Vegan Thursdays. In any dynamic system, the initial conditions have a huge influence over what happens. By imagining failure in advance - by thinking through what might cause a false start - you can anticipate some of the potential problems and avoid them once the actual project begins. Happiness climbs high early in adulthood but begins to slide downward in the late thirties and early forties, dipping to a low in the fifties. Then well-being later in life often exceeds that of our younger years. In our naïve twenties and thirties, our hopes are high, our scenarios rosy. Then reality trickles in. Over time we adjust our aspirations and later realize that life is pretty good. In short, we dip in the middle because we’re lousy forecasters. In youth, our expectations are too high. In older age, they’re too low. In the middle, we relax our standards, perhaps because others relax their assessments of us. When we reach a midpoint between a known start and finish, a mental siren alerts us that we’ve squandered half of our time. That injects a healthy dose of stress - Uh-oh, we’re running out of time! - that revives our motivation and reshapes our strategy. Teams made their most significant progress during a concentrated midpoint burst. The most motivating wake-up call is one that comes when you’re running slightly behind. Being down by one at halftime was more advantageous than being up by one. Merely telling people they were slightly behind an opponent led them to exert more effort. If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story. The fast finish effect: When we near the end, we kick a little harder. Deadlines are often effective. People given a hard deadline - a date and time - are more likely to sign up than those for whom the choice is open-ended. They evaluated a life with twenty-nine years of treachery and six months of goodness the same as a life with twenty-nine years of goodness and six months of treachery. When time is expansive and open-ended, (when young) we orient to the future and pursue “knowledge-related goals.” We form social networks that are wide and loose, hoping to gather information and forge relationships that can help us in the future. When time is constrained and limited, (when old) we attune to the now. We pursue different goals - emotional satisfaction, an appreciation for life, a sense of meaning. And these updated goals make people highly selective in their choice of social partners. We omit needless people. We choose to spend our remaining years with networks that are small, tight, and populated with those who satisfy higher needs. What spurs editing isn’t aging per se, but endings of any sort. students in their final year displayed the same kind of social-network pruning People informed that a chocolate was last liked it significantly more than any other chocolate they’d sampled. Screenwriters understand the importance of endings that elevate. An artist gives us the emotion he’s promised, but with a rush of unexpected insight. That often comes when the main character finally understands an emotionally complex truth. The story has its protagonist achieving the goal he wants - only to realize it is not what the protagonist needs. Children who played a rhythmic, synchronized clap-and-tap game were more likely than children who played nonsynchronous games to later help their peers.

Strong-future languages such as English, Italian, and Korean require speakers to make sharp distinctions between the present and the future. Weak-future languages such as Mandarin, Finnish, and Estonian draw little or often no contrast at all. Speakers of weak-future languages were 30 percent more likely to save for retirement and 24 percent less likely to smoke.

Getting the Love You Want,Harville Hendrix,0805087001,7,"We are looking for someone who has the predominant character traits of the people who raised us. Trying to re-create the environment of childhood. A compelling need to heal old childhood wounds. Fusers and isolaters tend to marry each other. An ""isolater"": people who unconsciously push others away. They keep people at a distance because they need to have ""a lot of space"". They want the freedom to come and go. They don't want to be ""pinned down"" to a single relationship. Underneath this cool exterior is a two-year-old who was not allowed to satisfy a natural need for independence. A ""fuser"": people who seem to have an insatiable need for closeness. Fusers want to ""do things together"" all the time. If people fail to show up at the appointed time, they feel abandoned. The thought of divorce fills them with terror. They crave physical affection and reassurance, and often need to stay in constant verbal contact. Underneath all this clinging behavior is a young child whose parents pushed them away when they come running to them for comfort. Children instinctively observe the choices their parents make, the freedoms and pleasures they allow themselves, the talents they develop, the abilities they ignore, and the rules they follow. All of this has a profound effect on children: ""This is how we live. This is how to get through life."" Whether children accept their parents' model or rebel. Separate entities: 1. Your ""lost self,"" those parts of your being that you had to repress because of the demands of society. 2. Your ""false self,"" the facade that you erected in order to fill the void created by this repression and by a lack of adequate nurturing. 3. Your ""disowned self,"" the negative parts of your false self that met with disapproval and were therefore denied. Someone who stirs within us a deep sense of recognition: ""This is the one I've been looking for! This is the one who will make up for the wounds of the past!"" What people are doing in these yin/yang matches is trying to reclaim their lost selves by proxy. Being emotionally attached to this person made his or her attributes feel a part of a larger, more fulfilled you. It was as if you had merged with the other person and become whole. A person who grew up repressing his or her feelings will choose someone who is unusually expressive. Think for a minute about some part of your being that you feel is deficient. Once a relationship seems secure, a psychological switch is triggered deep in the old brain that activates all the latent infantile wishes. It is as if the wounded child within takes over. Says the child, ""I've been good enough long enough to ensure that this person is going to stay around for a while. Let's see the payoff."" Use of global words like ""always"" and ""never"" is an indication that someone is in a regressive state. Young children have a hard time distinguishing between past and present; whatever is happening at this moment has always happened in the past and will always happen in the future. People react to their partners as if they were carbon copies of their parents, even though not all of their traits are the same. In their compelling need to work on unfinished business, they project the missing parental traits onto their partners. Then, by treating their partners as if they actually had these traits, they manage to provoke the desired response. All people have a dark side to their nature, a part of their being that they try to ignore. For the most part, these are creative adaptations to childhood wounds. People also acquire negative traits by observing their parents. People try to exorcise their denied negative traits by projecting them onto their mates. They look at their partners and criticize all the things they dislike and deny in themselves. In most interactions with your partner, you are actually safer when you lower your defenses than when you keep them engaged, because your partner becomes an ally, not an enemy. Your love relationship has a hidden purpose - the healing of childhood wounds. A relationship that fosters maximum psychological growth - to be safe, to be healed, and to be whole. Create a more accurate image of your partner. At the very moment of attraction, you began fusing your lover with your primary caretakers. Later you projected your negative traits onto your partner, further obscuring your partner's essential reality. Let go of these illusions and begin to see more of your partner's truth. See your partner not as your savior but as another wounded human being, struggling to be healed. In an unconscious partnership, you believe that the way to have a good relationship is to pick the right partner. In a conscious partnership you realize you have to be the right partner. He was locked into a view of the world that went something like this: Wandering around the world were people on whose foreheads were stamped the words ""Friend of Walter,"" and his job was merely to search until he found them. ""There are no friends out there. What you want does not exist. All people in the world are strangers. If you want a friend, you're going to have to go out and make one!"" What would it be like if you lived in the relationship of your dreams? Defining the vision turns your energy away from past and present disappointments toward a more hopeful future. We start to act out our feelings rather than put them into words. As an example, it's easier to stay late at work than to tell your partner that you feel unhappy every time you walk in the front door. Fidelity and commitment create the feeling of safety that allows couples to work on their unconscious issues and heal. People operate out of the erroneous belief that their partners know exactly what it is that they want. When their partners fail to satisfy their secret desires, they assume that they are deliberately depriving them of pleasure. This makes them want to deprive their partners of pleasure. They just can't think of anything their partners can do for them. They don't seem to have any needs or desires. What they are really doing is hiding behind the psychic shield they erected as children to protect themselves from overbearing parents. They discovered early in life that one way to maintain a feeling of autonomy around their intrusive parents was to keep their thoughts and feelings to themselves. When they deprived their parents of this valuable information, their parents were less able to invade their space. After a while, many isolaters do the ultimate disappearing act and hide their feelings from themselves. Many of your repetitious, emotional criticisms of your partner are disguised statements of your own unmet needs.","Legendary book about making relationships work, recommended by many. Main point is that we're looking for our partner to heal childhood wounds. A must-read if you're near the start of a serious relationship."
Perennial Seller,Ryan Holiday,0143109014,7,"The true function of a writer is to produce a masterpiece. Focus on the things that don’t change. In a year, will the extra two days you spent seem excessive? In ten years, will spending ten extra days? Haste is no part of it. Whether a really good book is finished a year earlier or a year later makes no difference. Even if you fail at your ambitious thing, it’s very hard to fail completely. Will this business still be around a decade from now? There were forty-seven alternative endings for Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms. He rewrote the first part of the book, by his own count, more than fifty times. He wrote all of them, trying them like pieces of a puzzle until one finally fit. Jack Kerouac supposedly wrote On the Road in a three-week drug-fueled blitz. But he spent six years editing and refining it until it was finally ready. A creative work usually starts with an idea that seems to have potential and then evolves with work and interaction into something more. Small, even silly ideas can become big, important, awe-inspiring works if a person invests enough time in them. Within seemingly ordinary people there can exist depths of wisdom, beauty, and insight - if they put in the work to plumb those deep depths. Mediocre ideas that contain buried within them the seeds of much better ideas. The key is to catch them early. And the only way to do that is by doing the work at least partly in front of an audience. A book should be an article before it’s a book, and a dinner conversation before it’s an article. See how things go before going all in. Find your niche and scratch it! Charlie Rose asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the blockbuster musical Hamilton, what set him apart from some of the smarter, more talented kids he had gone to school with. Miranda answered: “’Cause I picked a lane and I started running ahead of everybody else . . . I was like, ‘All right, THIS.’” Know who you are doing it for - and who you are not doing it for. Write to please just one person. Don’t make it so specific that the only member of that audience is you. It’s not what a book is, it’s what a book does. The key to success in nonfiction was that the work should be either “very entertaining” or “extremely practical.” Be the only one doing what you are doing. Only is better than best. The best version is not for everybody. The best art divides the audience. If you put out a record and half the people who hear it absolutely love it and half the people who hear it absolutely hate it, you’ve done well. Because it is pushing that boundary. A movie must be better to see the second or third time than it is the first time. There must be more in it to see at once than any one person can grasp. It must be meaty, full of implications. Work is unlikely to be layered if it is written in a single stream of consciousness. Deep, complex work is built through a relentless, repetitive process of revisitation. When people tell you something’s wrong or doesn’t work for them, they are almost always right. When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always wrong. Be testing your project as you create it. Seriously test your creation as it begins to resemble a final product. Does a summary of the book work as a talk? Write a press release about it before the idea is even given the green light. If you can’t come up with a way to express your idea in exciting and compelling terms at this early stage, well, good thing it was caught in time before you launched that dud. Write out exactly what your project is supposed to be and to do in: One sentence. One paragraph. One page. This is a ______ that does ______. This helps people ______. What genre does it fit in? Genre matters. Everything that has a clear path to commercial success is in a genre. We need to be able to put things into categories so we know where they fit. No creator can magically inherit the audience of another. Explicitly say who you are building your thing for. It takes ten thousand readers for a book to successfully break through and for the ideas in it to take hold. Positioning is what your project is and who it is for. Packaging is what it looks like and what it’s called. The Pitch is the sell - how the project is described and what it offers to the audience. Each is essential. Each feeds into the others. Done properly, your work will scream: “Pick me - forsake the others. This is urgent!” Done haphazardly, your work simply says: “Bleh.” Of course you can judge a book by its cover - that’s why books have covers. Consult the book The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. The first seven laws of this classic marketing tome deal with the art of positioning and packaging. My book about Stoic philosophy, for example, had to become “a book that uses the ancient formula of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius to teach people how to not only overcome obstacles but thrive because of them.” The artificial notion of a launch is almost more important now than ever - customers have so much choice, they tend to choose what appears to have momentum. People choose what others are choosing. Email : “Hey, as many of you know, I have been working on ______ for a long time. It’s a ______ that does ______ for ______. I could really use your help. If you’re in the media or have an audience or you have any ideas or connections or assets that might be valuable when I launch this thing, I would be eternally grateful. Just tell me who you are, what you’re willing to offer, what it might be good for, and how to be in touch.” What is the right price to create a perennial seller? As cheap as possible without damaging the perception of your product. Damaging the perception of your product through price is very hard to do. A classic of any kind has two characteristics: 1) It’s good 2) it has been consumed by a lot of people (relatively, at least). The cheaper a book is, the more copies it sells (and, counterintuitively, makes more money than if it were expensive). Everyone overestimates the value of traditional PR. Much of the press that people chase is ephemeral and ineffectual, yet expensive and time-consuming to get. But traditional press is underrated for the use of credibility and status. “Trading up the chain”: In an interconnected media age, outlets pick up and re-report on each other’s stories. By starting with a small podcast where I could tell the story on my own terms, which led to a pickup on a small site that covers a niche, and then sharing and spreading that piece so it was seen by the right people, I was able to ultimately go from a tiny show to one of the biggest and most influential outlets in the world. The most newsworthy thing to do is usually the one you’re most afraid of. The thing you joke, “But of course, we can’t do that.” Be wary of overinvesting in social platforms. People who want long-term success must participate. Jay Jay French realized that he wasn’t in the music business - he was in the Twisted Sister business. Work at supporting your art at least as long as you worked in the creation phase of it. The best way to market yourself is by making more great work. There is a difference between something that services your audience and something that expands it. Call it the “One for Them, One for Me” strategy. In a good career, there’s room for both. The internet is favoring people who can move horizontally and integrate vertically, who can create innovative empires, not just produce work.","Great thoughts on creating a timeless masterpiece (whether music, book, or any art) - and then promoting it. Very inspiring for any creator."
Principles,Ray Dalio,1501124021,7,"An approach to life based on principles helps me find out what’s true and what to do about it. Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals. Operate by principles that are so clearly laid out that their logic can easily be assessed and you and others can see if you walk the talk. Without principles we would be forced to react to all the things life throws at us individually. Instead, classify these situations into types. Embrace the fact that you don’t know everything you need to know. My success has more to do with knowing how to deal with *not* knowing. Consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained. Decide: 1) what you want 2) what is true 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 In relationships with others, your principles and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don’t will suffer. Know how to both strive for a lot and fail well. To make money in the markets, one needs to be an independent thinker who bets against the consensus and is right. That’s because the consensus view is baked into the price. To be a successful entrepreneur, the same is true, which means being painfully wrong a fair amount. “How do I know I’m right?” Man’s most distinctive quality is our singular ability to look down on reality from a higher perspective and synthesize an understanding of it. While other species operate by following their instincts, man alone can go above himself and look at himself within his circumstances and within time. People to confuse what they want to be true with what actually is true. Seeing things from the top down is the best way to understand. Find the one code/law that drives them all. To understand the world accurately it’s worth having a bottom-up perspective. You need both. By taking a bottom-up perspective that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines up with our theories about the laws that we expect to govern it. Don’t get hung up on your views of how things “should” be because you will miss out on learning how they really are. Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that I’m wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense. Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. Don’t call something good or bad in an absolute sense based only on how it affects individuals. To do so would presume that what the individual wants is more important than the good of the whole. Memory-based, conscious learning produces less rapid progress than experimentation and adaptation. Things (toys, bigger houses, money, status, etc.) don’t supply anywhere near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at something does. It is the evolution, not the rewards, that matter. The need to have meaningful work is connected to man’s innate desire to improve. To gain strength one has to push one’s limits, which is painful. Develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than avoid it, Go to the pain rather than avoid it. If you choose the healthy route, the pain will soon turn into pleasure. Life doesn’t give a damn about what you like. It’s up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it and then find the courage to carry it through. First-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences. First-order consequences of exercise are the pain and time spent. Second-order consequences are better health and more attractive appearance Food that tastes good is often bad for you and vice versa. The first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want. Nature throws us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizes those who make their decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone. It is much more important that you are a good designer/manager of your life than a good worker in it. Most people operate emotionally and in the moment; their lives are a series of undirected emotional experiences, going from one thing to the next. You shouldn’t be upset if you find out that you’re bad at something - you should be happy that you found out, because knowing that and dealing with it will improve your chances of getting what you want. Imagine all the areas in which Einstein was incompetent. When encountering your weaknesses you have four choices: 1. You can deny them (which is what most people do). 2. You can accept them and work at them in order to try to convert them into strengths (which might or might not work depending on your ability to change). 3. You can accept your weaknesses and find ways around them. 4. Or, you can change what you are going after. Which solution you choose will be critically important to the direction of your life. The worst path you can take is the first. Believable parties are those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished something - and have great explanations for how they did it. I recommend Richard Dawkins’s and E. O. Wilson’s books on evolution. If I had to pick just one, it would be Dawkins’s River Out of Eden. 1. Have clear goals. 2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals. 3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. 4. Design plans that will get you around them. 5. Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results. You will need to do all five steps well to be successful and you must do them one at a time and in order. For example, when setting goals, just set goals. Don’t think about how you will achieve them or what you will do if something goes wrong. When you are diagnosing problems, don’t think about how you will solve them - just diagnose them. Blurring the steps interferes with uncovering the true problems. The process is iterative: Doing each step thoroughly will provide you with the information you need to move on to the next step and do it well. Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can’t have everything you want. Don’t let yourself be paralyzed by all the choices. You can have much more than what you need to be happy. Make your choice and get on with it. Don’t confuse goals with desires. A goal is something that you really need to achieve. Desires are things that you want that can prevent you from reaching your goals. Typically, desires are first-order consequences. Great expectations create great capabilities. If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar way too low. View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you. Once you identify a problem, don’t tolerate it. Design a plan. a. Go back before you go forward. Replay the story of where you have been (or what you have done) that led up to where you are now, and then visualize what you and others must do in the future so you will reach your goals. b. Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine. Practice higher-level thinking by looking down on your machine and thinking about how it can be changed to produce better outcomes. Someone other than you should be objectively measuring and reporting on your progress. * Goal setting (such as determining what you want your life to be) requires you to be good at higher-level thinking like visualization and prioritization. * Identifying and not tolerating problems requires you to be perceptive and good at synthesis and maintaining high standards * Diagnosis requires you to be logical, able to see multiple possibilities, and willing to have hard conversations with others * Designing requires visualization and practicality * Doing what you set out to do requires self-discipline, good work habits, and a results orientation. No one has all those qualities. Have humility so you can get what you need from others! Look at the patterns of your mistakes and identify at which step in the 5-Step Process you typically fail. Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in the way of their success; find yours and deal with it. Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person’s fatal flaw - a flaw that, had it been fixed, instead would have led to a wonderful outcome. Ego and blind spots are the fatal flaws that keep intelligent, hardworking people from living up to their potential. You can’t put out without taking in. Most people seem much more eager to put out (convey their thinking and be productive) than to take in (learn). That’s a mistake even if one’s primary goal is to put out, because what one puts out won’t be good unless one takes in. When two people believe opposite things, chances are that one of them is wrong. It pays to find out if that someone is you. Closed-minded people don’t want their ideas challenged. They are typically frustrated that they can’t get the other person to agree with them instead of curious as to why the other person disagrees. Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement. Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions. Open-minded people genuinely believe they could be wrong. Open-minded people are always more interested in listening than in speaking. Use feelings of anger/frustration as cues to calm down, slow down, and approach the subject at hand thoughtfully. Record the circumstances in which you’ve consistently made bad decisions because you failed to see what others saw. Write a list, tack it up on the wall, and stare at it. If ever you find yourself about to make a big decision in one of these areas, consult others. Be evidence-based: Most people do not look thoughtfully at the facts and draw their conclusions by objectively weighing the evidence. Instead, they make their decisions based on what their deep-seated subconscious mind wants and then they filter the evidence to make it consistent with those desires. Can you point to clear facts (i.e., facts believable people wouldn’t dispute) leading to your view? If not, chances are you’re not being evidence-based. Use evidence-based decision-making tools. A decision-making computer that gives you logically derived instructions. There are no greater battles than those between feeling and thinking. It is so important to reconcile what you get from your subconscious with what you get from your conscious. If you stick with a behavior for approximately eighteen months, you will build a strong tendency to stick to it nearly forever. Your greatest challenge will be having your thoughtful higher-level you manage your emotional lower-level you. The best way to do that is to consciously develop habits that will make doing the things that are good for you habitual. Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you’ve asked questions and explored. Getting an accurate picture of reality ultimately comes down to two things: 1. being able to synthesize accurately 2. knowing how to navigate levels. Synthesis is the process of converting a lot of data into an accurate picture. To synthesize well, you must 1) synthesize the situation at hand 2) synthesize the situation through time 3) navigate levels effectively. No sensible person should reject a believable person’s views without great fear of being wrong. One of the most important decisions you can make is who you ask questions of. Listening to uninformed people is worse than having no answers at all. Be an imperfectionist. The marginal gains of studying even the important things past a certain point are limited. Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate. Logic, reason, and common sense are your best tools for synthesizing reality and understanding what to do about it. Make your decisions as expected value calculations. Think of every decision as a bet with a probability and a reward for being right and a probability and a penalty for being wrong. Suppose something that has only a one-in-five chance (20%) of succeeding will return ten times (e.g., $1,000) the amount that it will cost you if it fails ($100). Its expected value is positive ($120), so it’s probably a smart decision, even though the odds are against you, as long as you can also cover the loss. Play these probabilities over and over again and they will surely give you winning results over time. You can almost always improve your odds of being right by doing things that will give you more information. Knowing when not to bet is as important as knowing what bets are probably worth making. You can significantly improve your track record if you only make the bets that you are most confident will pay off. The best choices are the ones that have more pros than cons, not those that don’t have any cons at all. Watch out for people who argue against something whenever they can find something - anything - wrong with it, without properly weighing all the pluses and minuses. Such people tend to be poor decision makers. Don’t mistake possibilities for probabilities. People who can accurately sort probabilities from possibilities are generally strong at “practical thinking”; they’re the opposite of the “philosopher” types who tend to get lost in clouds of possibilities. 1. Slow down your thinking so you can note the criteria you are using to make your decision. 2. Write the criteria down as a principle. 3. Think about those criteria when you have an outcome to assess, and refine them before the next “one of those” comes along. People who have common sense, imagination, and determination, who know what they value and what they want, and who also use computers, math, and game theory, are the best decision makers there are. The value of a widely known insight disappears over time. A lot of people vest their blind faith in machine learning because they find it much easier than developing deep understanding. Because the same kinds of things happen over and over again, a relatively few well-thought-out principles will allow you to deal with just about anything that reality throws at you. Don’t fall into the common trap of wishing that reality worked differently than it does or that your own realities were different. Instead, embrace your realities and deal with them effectively. Have principles and use them consistently. Never stop refining and improving them.","Wow. So dense with wisdom that I wanted to highlight almost every paragraph. Instead, I skipped Part 1, about his background, because in the intro he recommends you skip it. I also skipped Part 3, about work principles, since they were all collaborative group-stuff, and I’m not working with anyone now. So here are my notes just from Part 2, “Life Principles”, which were so good I’ll probably re-read this book again next year. Caveat: it’s mostly so high-level — (“Decide what is true, then decide what to do about it.”) — that they’re more like koans to spark your own thoughts, instead of specific “do this” type advice."
How to Read a Book,Charles Van Doren and Mortimer Adler,0671212095,7,"The reader is the catcher in a game of baseball. Catching the ball is just as much an activity as pitching or hitting it. You know the book has more to say than you understand and hence that it contains something that can increase your understanding. Reading anything that, is at once thoroughly intelligible to us may increase our store of information, but cannot improve our understanding, for our understanding was equal to them before we started. Otherwise, we would have felt the shock of puzzlement and perplexity that comes from getting in over our depth. A person tries to read something that at first he does not completely understand. The thing to be read is initially better or higher than the reader. The writer is communicating something that can increase the reader’s understanding. Communication between unequals must be possible, or else one person could never learn from another. Here by “learning” is meant understanding more, not remembering more information that has the same degree of intelligibility as other information you already possess. The reader must be able to overcome this inequality, approaching equality with the writer. To the extent that equality is approached, clarity of communication is achieved. Enlightenment is achieved only when, in addition to knowing what an author says, you know what he means and why he says it. Active reading is the effort to understand. One must also use one’s senses and imagination. One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what cannot be observed. You need keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect trained in analysis and reflection. Reading is learning from one who is absent. If you ask a book a question, you must answer it yourself. Radio and especially television are so designed as to make thinking seem unnecessary. The packaging of intellectual positions and views from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics - to make it easy for him to “make up his own mind” with the minimum of difficulty and effort. The non-thinker: He inserts a packaged opinion into his mind. He then pushes a button and “plays back” the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think. If you understand perfectly everything the author has to say, you have not increased your understanding. Gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more. You have gained nothing but information if you have exercised only your memory. Avoid the error of assuming that to be widely read and to be well-read are the same thing. Teaching : sharing with only two other arts - agriculture and medicine - an exceptionally important characteristic : * the patient must get well * plants or animals must grow * the student must learn When the learner proceeds without the help of any sort of teacher, the operations of learning are performed on nature or the world rather than on discourse. The rules of such learning constitute the art of unaided discovery. ## SKIM: Skim systematically, to learn everything that the surface alone can teach you. The question typically asked at this level is “What is the book about?” The analytical reader must ask many organized questions of what he is reading. Study the table of contents to obtain a general sense of the book’s structure; use it as you would a road map before taking a trip. Check the index. Estimate the range of topics covered. Read the publisher’s blurb, where they summarize as accurately as they can the main points in their book. Look now at the chapters that seem to be pivotal to its argument. Read summary statements in their opening or closing pages. Turn the pages, dipping in here and there, reading a paragraph or two. Read the last two or three pages, or, if these are an epilogue, the last few pages of the main part of the book. Few authors are able to resist the temptation to sum up what they think is new and important about their work in these pages. You have now skimmed the book systematically. In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away. Every book, no matter how difficult, contains interstitial material that can be and should be read quickly; and every good book also contains matter that is difficult and should be read very slowly. Race through even the hardest book. You will then be prepared to read it well the second time. The one simple prescription for active reading. Ask questions while you read - questions that you yourself must try to answer in the course of reading. Four main questions you must ask about any book: 1. WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT AS A WHOLE? 2. WHAT IS BEING SAID IN DETAIL, AND HOW? (the main ideas, assertions, and arguments) 3. IS THE BOOK TRUE, IN WHOLE OR PART? 4. WHAT OF IT? (Is it important to you to know these things? What else follows? What is further implied or suggested?) Ask a book questions as you read with a pencil in your hand. The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks. ## Forming the Habit of Reading: You must learn to forget the separate acts in order to perform all of them well. But in order to forget them as separate acts, you have to learn them first as separate acts. * Expository books convey knowledge primarily. * Theoretical books teach you that something is the case. * Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do. To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from knowing what is the case to knowing what to do about it. If a theoretical book emphasizes things that lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is a scientific work. If not, it is philosophical. The philosopher usually finds it easier to teach students who have not been previously taught by his colleagues, whereas the scientist prefers the student whom his colleagues have already prepared. State the unity of the whole book in a single sentence, or at most a few sentences (a short paragraph). Discover its theme or main point. Set forth the major parts of the book, and show how these are organized into a whole, by being ordered to one another and to the unity of the whole. You have not grasped a complex unity if all you know about it is how it is one. You must also know how it is an organized many. To give an account of the structure of the book: (1) The author accomplished this plan in five major parts, of which the first part is about so and so, the second part is about such and such, the third part is about this, the fourth part about that, and the fifth part about still another thing. (2) The first of these major parts is divided into three sections, of which the first considers X, the second considers Y, and the third considers Z. (3) In the first section of the first part, the author makes four points, of which the first is A, the second B, the third C, and the fourth D. Find out what the author’s problems were. The author starts with a question. Formulate the questions as precisely as you can. The kinds of questions anyone can ask about anything: * Does something exist? * What kind of thing is it? * What caused it to exist, or under what conditions can it exist, or why does it exist? * What purpose does it serve? * What are the consequences of its existence? * What are its characteristic properties, its typical traits? * What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort? * How does it behave? * What ends should be sought? * What means should be chosen to a given end? * What things must one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order? * Under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse? * Under what conditions would it be better to do this rather than that? The first stage of analytical reading, or rules for finding what a book is about: 1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. 2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. 3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. 4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve. The best poetry is that which is the most richly ambiguous. The most important words are those that give you trouble. You have to discover the meaning of a word you do not understand by using the meanings of all the other words in the context that you do understand. He may indulge in all sorts of supporting and surrounding discussion. But the heart of his communication lies in the major affirmations and denials he is making, and the reasons he gives for so doing. To come to grips, therefore, you have to see the main sentences as if they were raised from the page in high relief. See how essential a part of reading it is to be perplexed and know it. Wonder is the beginning of wisdom in learning from books as well as from nature. If you never ask yourself any questions about the meaning of a passage, you cannot expect the book to give you any insight you do not already possess. The fact that we have stated these rules in a fixed order does not mean that you have to follow them in that order. “State in your own words!” That suggests the best test we know for telling whether you have understood the proposition or propositions in the sentence. If you cannot get away at all from the author’s words, it shows that only words have passed from him to you, not thought or knowledge. Like knowing not just “2 + 2 = 4” but therefore “4 – 2 = 2” Exemplify the general truth that has been enunciated by referring to a particular instance of it. To imagine a possible case is often as good as citing an actual one. If you cannot, you do not know what is being said. Unless you can show some acquaintance with actual or possible facts to which the proposition refers or is relevant somehow, you are playing with words, not dealing with thought and knowledge. Lack of grammar and logic results in slavery to words rather than mastery of them. You often have to search through all the paragraphs of a chapter to find the sentences you can construct into a statement of a single argument. One of the most familiar tricks of the orator or propagandist is to leave certain things unsaid, things that are highly relevant to the argument, but that might be challenged if they were made explicit. Every argument must involve a number of statements. If you find the conclusion first, then look for the reasons. If you find the reasons first, see where they lead. Discriminate between the kind of argument that points to facts as evidence for some generalization and the kind that offers a series of general statements to prove some further generalizations. Observe what things the author says he must assume, what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced, and what need not be proved because it is self-evident. Every argument must start with assumptions agreed on between writer and reader, or with self-evident propositions, which neither the writer nor reader can deny. Self-evident propositions are indemonstrable but also undeniable truths, based on common experience alone and are part of common-sense knowledge. The second stage of analytical reading, or rules for finding what a book says (interpreting its contents): 5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words. 6. Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences. 7. Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences. 8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve. Reading a book is a kind of conversation. The reader has the last word. Reading does not stop with understanding. It must be completed by the work of criticism, the work of judging. There is no book so good that no fault can be found with it. Unless readers exercise their critical faculties now, they are doing the author an injustice. He has done what he could to make them his equal. He deserves that they act like his peers, that they engage in conversation with him, that they talk back. To regard anyone except yourself as responsible for your judgment is to be a slave, not a free man. It is from this fact that the liberal arts acquire their name. Be not only a responsive but also a responsible listener. Take the responsibility of taking a position. To criticize is not always to disagree. Suspending judgment is taking the position that something has not been shown - that you are not convinced or persuaded. Hesitate before you say, “I understand.” You have a lot of work to do before you can make that declaration honestly Writers, such as Plato and Kant, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, who have not been able to say everything they knew or thought in a single work. Those who judge Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason without reading his Critique of Practical Reason, or Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations without reading his Theory of the Moral Sentiments, or The Communist Manifesto without Marx’s Capital, are more likely than not to be agreeing or disagreeing with something they do not fully understand. Regard disagreements as capable of being resolved. Disagreement is futile agitation unless it is undertaken with the hope that it may lead to the resolution of an issue. The person who disagrees should be as much prepared to have his own mind changed as seek to change the mind of another - to keep the possibility that he misunderstands or that he is ignorant on some point. Many people regard disagreement as unrelated to either teaching or being taught. They think that everything is just a matter of opinion. On such a view, communication cannot be profitable if the profit to be gained is an increase in knowledge. Distinguish between genuine knowledge and mere opinion. The reader who does not distinguish between the reasoned statement of knowledge and the flat expression of opinion is not reading to learn. He is at most interested in the author’s personality and is using the book as a case history. Knowledge consists in those opinions for which there is evidence of one kind or another. Opinion is unsupported judgment. After he has said, “I understand but I disagree,” he can make the following remarks to the author: (1) “You are uninformed” (2) “You are misinformed” (3) “You are illogical - your reasoning is not cogent” (4) “Your analysis is incomplete” In science and history, the lack of information is discovered by later researches. Non sequitur, which means that what is drawn as a conclusion simply does not follow from the reasons offered. If you have not been able to show that the author is uninformed, misinformed, or illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. You must agree. You cannot say, as so many students and others do, “I find nothing wrong with your premises, and no errors in reasoning, but I don’t agree with your conclusions.” All you can possibly mean by saying something like that is that you do not like the conclusions. You are not disagreeing. You are expressing your emotions or prejudices. The third stage of analytical reading: rules for criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge. General maxims of intellectual etiquette: 9. Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say “I understand.”) 10. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously. 11. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make. B. Special Criteria for Points of Criticism 12. Show wherein the author is uninformed. 13. Show wherein the author is misinformed. 14. Show wherein the author is illogical. 15. Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete. No higher commendation can be given any work of the human mind than to praise it for the measure of truth it has achieved. A person who has read widely but not well deserves to be pitied rather than praised. The great writers read fewer books. But what they did read, they read well. Because they had mastered these books, they became peers with their authors. They become authorities in their own right. One approaches the ideal of good reading by applying the rules we have described in the reading of a single book, and not by trying to become superficially acquainted with a larger number. Seeking the meaning of a book: do all that you can by yourself before seeking outside help. For if you act consistently on this principle, you will find that you need less and less outside help. Read the great books in relation to one another, and in an order that somehow respects chronology. The conversation of the books takes place in time. Abstracts are useful in only two connections: First, they can help to jog your memory of a book’s contents, if you have already read it. Second, when you wish to know whether a certain work is likely to be germane to your project. An abstract can never replace the reading of a book, but it can sometimes tell you whether you want or need to read the book or not. To use a reference book well, you must, first, have some idea of what you want to know. Use a dictionary according to its primary intention - as a help in reading books that might otherwise be too difficult because their vocabulary includes technical words, archaic words, literary allusions, or even familiar words used in obsolete senses. We would not recommend looking up a technical word or with a word that is wholly new to you during your first reading of a good book unless they seem to be important to the author’s general meaning. The seven liberal arts : grammar, rhetoric, and logic, the trivium; arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music, the quadrivium. An encyclopedia is not the best place to pursue understanding. It contains no arguments. Reading practical books, the kind dealing mainly with the principles underlying rules, An intelligent reader of such books about “practical principles” always reads between the lines or in the margins. He tries to see the rules that may not be expressed but that can, nevertheless, be derived from the principles. He goes further. He tries to figure out how the rules should be applied in practice. To fail to read a practical book as practical is to read it poorly. A rule of conduct is practically true on two conditions: one is that it works; the other is that its working leads you to an end you rightly desire. We have no practical interest in even the soundest means to reach ends we disapprove of or do not care about. The two major questions you must ask yourself in reading any sort of practical book. The first is: What are the author’s objectives? The second is: What means for achieving them is he proposing? What reaches the heart without going through the mind is likely to bounce back and put the mind out of business. Agreement with a practical book, however, does imply action on your part. If you are convinced or persuaded by the author that the ends he proposes are worthy, and if you are further convinced or persuaded that the means he recommends are likely to achieve those ends, then it is hard to see how you can refuse to act in the way the author wishes you to. If you did not, it is not just because you were lazy or tired. It is because you did not really mean it. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth. Don’t try to resist the effect that a work of imaginative literature has on you. The reader of nonfiction should be like a bird of prey, constantly alert, always ready to pounce. Reading poetry and fiction is not the same. If we must escape from reality, it should be to a deeper, or greater, reality. The reality of our inner life, of our own unique vision of the world. To discover this reality makes us happy; the experience is deeply satisfying to some part of ourselves we do not ordinarily touch. Poetry and fiction must be read as having several distinct though related meanings. One of the most remarkable things about the great philosophical books is that they ask the same sort of profound questions that children ask. A person who has the ability to retain the child’s view of the world, with at the same time a mature understanding of what it means to retain it, is extremely rare - likely to be able to contribute something really important to our thinking. What are these “childishly simple” questions that philosophers ask? What is the difference between existing and not existing? What is common to all the things that do exist, and what are the properties of everything that does exist? Are there different ways in which things can exist - different modes of being or existence? Do some things exist only in the mind or for the mind, whereas others exist outside the mind, and whether or not they are known to us, or even knowable by us? Does everything that exists exist physically, or are there some things that exist apart from material embodiment? Do all things change, or is there anything that is immutable? Does anything exist necessarily, or must we say that everything that does exist might not have existed? Is the realm of possible existence larger than the realm of what actually does exist? What is involved in any change? In every process of change, is there something that endures unchanged as well as some respect or aspect of that enduring thing which undergoes change? When you learn something that you did not know before, you have certainly changed with respect to the knowledge you have acquired, but you are also the same individual that you were before; if that were not the case, you could not be said to have changed through learning. Is this true of all change? For example, is it true of such remarkable changes as birth and death - of coming to be and passing away - or only of less fundamental changes, such as local motion, growth, or alteration in quality? How many different kinds of change are there? Do the same fundamental elements or conditions enter into all processes of change, and are the same causes operative in all? What do we mean by a cause of change? Are there different types of causes responsible for change? Are the causes of change - of becoming - the same as the causes of being, or existence? Good and evil, of course, are not the same as right and wrong. How do we make this distinction precise? Philosophy today is no longer being written for lay readers. Second-order questions are of narrow appeal; and professional philosophers, like scientists, are not interested in the views of anyone but other experts. History is closer to fiction than to science. The historian must always make up something. He assign causes for events and motivations for actions. The causes of every human action, Tolstoy thought, were so manifold, so complex, and so deeply hidden in unconscious motivations that it is impossible to know why anything ever happened. It is necessary to read more than one account of the history of an event or period if we want to understand it. Read a history not only to learn what really happened at a particular time and place in the past, but also to learn the way men act in all times and places, especially now. ## How to Read Biography and Autobiography: A biography is a story about a real person. This mixed patrimony causes it to have a mixed character. ## How to Read Science and Mathematics: Until approximately the end of the nineteenth century, the major scientific books were written for a lay audience. There was as yet no institutionalized specialization in those days, days which Albert Einstein called “the happy childhood of science.” Intelligent and well-read persons were expected to read scientific books as well as history and philosophy. Philosophers seldom write for anyone except other philosophers; economists write for economists. State, as clearly as you can, the problem that the author has tried to solve. Scientific objectivity is not the absence of initial bias. It is attained by frank confession of it. Detect this, and take account of it, by distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through argument. We are also not told, at least not early enough, how beautiful and how intellectually satisfying mathematics can be. Start with Euclid, whose Elements of Geometry is one of the most lucid and beautiful works of any kind that has ever been written. ## How to Read Philosophy: The most important thing to discover in reading any philosophical work is the question or questions it tries to answer. Dogmatic theology always depends upon dogmas and the authority of a church that proclaims them. Keep in mind that an article of faith is not something that the faithful assume. Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion. A mind not agitated by good questions cannot appreciate the significance of even the best answers. == Syntopical reading is to construct an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books. Syntopical reading: inspect all of the books on your list. Don't read any of them analytically before inspecting all of them. It will give you a clear enough idea of your subject so that your subsequent analytical reading of some of the books on the list is productive. Read some books faster than others. In syntopical reading, it is you and your concerns that are primarily to be served, not the books that you read. Find the passages in the books that are most germane to your needs. Force an author to use your language, rather than using his. Refuse to accept the terminology of any one author. The syntopical reader, in short, tries to look at all sides and to take no sides.","Light? No. Serious. Very serious and scholarly. Advises to read books that are above your current ability. A very specific methodology is given. Read books twice, ask questions while reading, answer those questions, then summarize and criticize afterwards. The point is to grow up to the level of the author."
The Road Less Traveled,M. Scott Peck,0743238257,7,"Life is difficult. This is one of the greatest truths. Once it is accepted, the fact no longer matters. Most moan as if life should be easy, as if their difficulties should not be. Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life’s problems. Without discipline we can solve nothing. With total discipline we can solve all problems. In this process of solving problems, life has its meaning. Problems create our courage and our wisdom. It is only because of problems that we grow. In school we deliberately set problems for children to solve. Most of us attempt to avoid problems. This tendency is the primary basis of all human mental illness. Discipline tools: delaying of gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth, and balancing. Undisciplined discipline is meaningless. Parents who devote time to their children will perceive in them subtle needs for discipline, how they study, when they tell subtle falsehoods, when they run away from problems. Feeling valuable is essential to mental health and self-discipline. It is a direct product of parental love. Self-discipline is self-caring. If we feel ourselves valuable, then we will feel our time to be valuable, to organize it and protect it and make maximum use of it. A neighbor repairing a lawn mower: “I’ve never been able to fix those kind of things!” “That’s because you don’t take the time.” Many people simply do not take the time necessary to solve many of life’s intellectual, social or spiritual problems. I thought that if I waited long enough the problem might go away. Problems do not go away. They must be worked through or else they remain. We cannot solve a problem by saying “It’s not my problem,” hoping that someone else will solve it for us. Many, seek to avoid the pain of their problems by saying, “This problem was caused me by other people, or by circumstances beyond my control, and therefore it is up to other people or society to solve this problem for me.” I can solve a problem only when I say “This is my problem and it’s up to me to solve it.” Distinguishing what we are and what we are not responsible for in this life is one of the greatest problems. It is never completely solved. Continually reassess where our responsibilities lie. Parents can assist their children in this maturation process. Either confront them with their tendency to avoid or escape responsibility for their own actions or can reassure them that certain situations are not their fault. Neurotics make themselves miserable. Those with character disorders make everyone else miserable. Whenever we seek to avoid the responsibility for our own behavior, we do so by attempting to give that responsibility to some other individual or organization or entity. But this means we then give away our power to that entity, be it “fate” or “society” or the government or the corporation or our boss. He will speak unceasingly of the oppressive forces in our society. I have tried to point out to him that he is not a child. As children, our parents are responsible for our well-being. He does not acknowledge these freedoms. Every time he speaks of how he is victimized by these forces he actually is giving away his freedom. Dedication to the truth must continually be employed. The more our minds are befuddled by falsehood, misperceptions and illusions, the less able we will be to determine correct courses of action and make wise decisions. Some stop making maps by the end of adolescence. By the end of middle age most people have given up the effort. They feel certain that their maps are complete and their world view is correct They are no longer interested in new information. If our maps are to be accurate we have to continually revise them. The world itself is constantly changing. Glaciers come, glaciers go. The vantage point from which we view the world is constantly and quite rapidly changing. Making revisions to your world view is painful. A person may expend much more energy defending an outmoded view of the world than would have been required to correct it in the first place. When he was a young child he suffered disappointment through his parents’ lack of caring. When he stopped trusting his parents, his disappointments diminished dramatically. The “reality” that this child came to was not “I can’t trust my parents” but “I can’t trust people.” Therefore that became the map. He passed up opportunities to revise his map. We must always hold truth as more vital to our self-interest than our comfort. Consider our personal discomfort relatively unimportant and even welcome it in the service of the search for truth. The only way that we can be certain that our map of reality is valid is to expose it to the criticism and challenge of other map-makers. The reason people lie is to avoid the pain of challenge and its consequences. Two of the most common lies are “We really love our children” and “Our parents really loved us.” When it is not the case, people often go to extraordinary lengths to avoid the realization. The decision to withhold the truth should never be based on personal needs, such as a need for power, a need to be liked or a need to protect one’s map from challenge. The assessment of another’s needs is an act of responsibility which is so complex that it can only be executed wisely when one operates with genuine love for the other. Balancing: To be completely honest, yet to withhold the whole truth when appropriate. Assume total responsibility but reject responsibility that is not truly ours. Delay gratification and keep an eye on the future, yet when it is not destructive - to live in the present and act spontaneously. The loss of balance is ultimately more painful than the sacrifice required to maintain balance. When I was a child my desire to win at games served me well. As a parent, I recognized that it got in my way. So it had to go. The feeling associated with giving up something that is a part of ourselves and familiar - is depression. Depression is a normal and basically healthy phenomenon. It becomes abnormal or unhealthy only when something interferes with the giving-up process, and depression is prolonged. The pain of giving up the outgrown which needs to be forsaken: The dependency of childhood The omnipotentiality of adolescence The “freedom” of uncommitment The agility of youth The sexual attractiveness and/or potency of youth The fantasy of immortality The independence of physical health And, ultimately, the self and life itself. Balance the need for stability and assertion of the self with the need for new knowledge and greater understanding. Temporarily give up your self to make room for the incorporation of new material. When a couple falls out of love they may begin to really love. When we act lovingly despite the fact that we don’t feel loving. In the course of many years of loving, extending our limits is a gradual but progressive enlargement of the self. A thinning of our ego boundaries: the more we love, the more blurred becomes the distinction between the self and the world. We become identified with the world. When you require another individual for your survival, you are a parasite on that individual. There is no choice, no freedom involved in your relationship. It is a matter of necessity rather than love. Love is the free exercise of choice. Two people love each other only when they are quite capable of living without each other but choose to live with each other. Passive dependent personality disorder: in their daydreams, they envisioned only an effortless passive state of receiving care. You cannot be a person worthy of love when your primary goal in life is to passively be loved. Passive dependent people, when married, will actually forsake skills that they had gained before marriage. An example of this is the not uncommon syndrome of the wife who “can’t” drive a car. Allowing yourself to be dependent on another person is the worst possible thing you can do to yourself. You would be better off being dependent on heroin. As long as you have a supply of it, heroin will never let you down; if it’s there, it will always make you happy. But if you expect another person to make you happy, you’ll be endlessly disappointed. We “love” pets. We do not know what our pets are thinking. This lack of knowledge allows us to project onto our pets our own thoughts and feelings, and thereby to feel an emotional closeness with them which may not correspond to reality at all. If their wills begin to diverge significantly from our own, we get rid of them. We send our pets to obedience school. We seek to foster their dependency. We do not want them to grow up and leave home. It is their attachment to us rather than their independence from us that we value in our pets. Love is not simply giving; it is judicious giving and judicious withholding as well. It is judicious praising and judicious criticizing. It is judicious arguing, struggling, confronting, urging, pushing and pulling in addition to comforting. Not giving at the right time was more compassionate than giving at the wrong time. Fostering independence was more loving than taking care of people who could otherwise take care of themselves. Love is not a feeling. Love is an action. Taking loving and constructive action toward a person you consciously dislike. Genuine love implies commitment and the exercise of wisdom. True love is a committed, thoughtful decision. Genuine love is volitional rather than emotional. The person who truly loves does so because of a decision to love. This person has made a commitment to be loving whether or not the loving feeling is present. It is necessary for a loving person to avoid acting on feelings of love. I may meet a woman who strongly attracts me, whom I feel like loving, but because it would be destructive to my marriage to have an affair at that time, I will say vocally or in the silence of my heart, “I feel like loving you, but I am not going to.” Love is always either work or courage. If an act is not one of work or courage, then it is not an act of love. The more children feel valuable, the more they will begin to say things of value. Listening is by far the most important form of attention. Attention is an act of will, of work against the inertia of our own minds. Death can become our ally, still fearsome but continually a source of wise counsel. The only real security in life lies in relishing life’s insecurity. It is our sense of commitment after the wedding which makes possible the transition from falling in love to genuine love. Children cannot grow to psychological maturity in an atmosphere of unpredictability. Couples cannot resolve issues of marriage without the security of knowing the act of struggling over these issues will not itself destroy the relationship. There are two ways to confront or criticize another human being: with instinctive and spontaneous certainty that one is right, or with a belief that one is probably right, arrived at through scrupulous self-doubting and self-examination. The first is the way of arrogance. The second is the way of humility. Shallow brooks are noisy. Still waters run deep. Loving must be focused as productively as possible through self-discipline. Your children are not your children. Give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts. Their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward. If our parents failed to care for us, we will likely envision the universe as similarly uncaring. The learning of something new requires a giving up of the old self and a death of outworn knowledge. To develop a broader vision we must be willing to forsake, to kill, our narrower vision. We begin by distrusting what we already believe, by actively seeking the threatening and unfamiliar, by deliberately challenging the validity of what we have previously been taught and hold dear. The path lies through questioning everything.","Profound truths and bold opinions on discipline, life, and love, written by a psychiatrist in 1978. It's been a best-seller all these years for a good reason."
Grit,Angela Duckworth,1501111108,7,"There was no expectation of ever catching up to their ambitions. In their own eyes, they were never good enough. They were the opposite of complacent. They were satisfied being unsatisfied. Each was chasing something of interest and importance. The chase was gratifying. They knew what they wanted. They had determination and direction. The most dazzling human achievements are the aggregate of countless ordinary individual elements. Dozens of small skills or activities carefully drilled into habit, then fitted together. There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence. When we can’t easily see how experience and training got someone to excellence, we label that person a “natural.” No one can see in the work of the artist how it has become. That is its advantage, for wherever one can see the act of becoming, one grows somewhat cool. Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of the genius. For if we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking. To call someone ‘divine’ means: ‘here there is no need to compete.’ Stop reading so much and go think. A theory is an explanation. A theory takes a blizzard of facts and observations and explains what is going on. By necessity, a theory is incomplete. It oversimplifies. But it helps us understand. John Irving’s dyslexia: in doing something over and over again, something that was never natural becomes almost second nature. “Rewriting is what I do best as a writer. I spend more time revising a novel or screenplay than I take to write the first draft. It’s become an advantage. It doesn’t hurt anyone as a writer to have to go over something again and again.” Will Smith: I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be outworked, period. Running hard was not just a function of aerobic capacity and muscle strength but also the extent to which a subject is willing to push himself or has a tendency to quit before the punishment becomes too severe. Getting back on the treadmill the next day, eager to try again, is in my view even more reflective of grit. How hard we push ourselves in a given workout matters, but the bigger impediment to progress is that sometimes we stop working out altogether. Consistency of effort over the long run is everything. Skipping around from one kind of pursuit to another: grit is about working on something you care about so much that you’re willing to stay loyal to it. Not just falling in love - staying in love. The word passion is often used to describe intense emotions. High achievers often talk about commitment of a different kind. Consistency over time. Enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare. Tom Seaver: Pitching determines what I eat, when I go to bed, what I do when I’m awake. It determines how I spend my life when I’m not pitching: pet dogs with my left hand or throw logs on the fire with my left hand. I eat cottage cheese instead of chocolate chip cookies in order to keep my weight down. Care about that same ultimate goal in an abiding, loyal, steady way. Pointing in the same direction: Grit is about holding the same top-level goal for a very long time. Any successful person has to decide what to do in part by deciding what not to do. Warren Buffett: Circle your five highest-priority goals. Then look at the twenty goals you didn’t circle. These you avoid at all costs. They’re what distract you; they eat away time and energy, taking your eye from the goals that matter more. Dogged perseverance toward a top-level goal requires, paradoxically perhaps, some flexibility at lower levels in the goal hierarchy. What definitively set apart the eminent from the rest of humanity were a cluster of four indicators: Degree to which he works with distant objects in view (as opposed to living from hand to mouth). Active preparation for later life. Working toward a definite goal. Tendency not to abandon tasks from mere changeability. Not seeking something fresh because of novelty. Not “looking for a change.” Degree of strength of will or perseverance. Quiet determination to stick to a course once decided upon. Tendency not to abandon tasks in the face of obstacles. Perseverance, tenacity, doggedness. Grit grows as we figure out our life philosophy, learn to dust ourselves off after rejection and disappointment, and learn to tell the difference between low-level goals that should be abandoned quickly and higher-level goals that demand more tenacity. Being a “promising beginner” is fun, but being an actual expert is infinitely more gratifying. People drop out of things for different reasons. “I’m bored.” “The effort isn’t worth it.” “This isn’t important to me.” “I can’t do this, so I might as well give up.” Don’t swap compasses. What ripens passion is the conviction that your work matters. Interest without purpose is nearly impossible to sustain Paul Silvia is a leading authority on the emotion of interest. For the beginner, novelty is anything that hasn’t been encountered before. For the expert, novelty is nuance. Teach kids to finish what they begin. Whatever they signed up for, they have to see it through to the end. “You’ve got to go to all the practices. You can’t say, ‘Oh, I’m tired of this.’ Once you commit, you discipline yourself to do it. There’s going to be times you don’t want to go, but you’ve got to go.” So much of sticking with things is believing you can do it. Parents who are both demanding and supportive. The technical term is “authoritative parenting”. There is much evidence for the benefits of supportive and demanding parenting. If you want to bring forth grit in your child, first ask how much passion and perseverance you have for your own life goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is that your approach to parenting encourages your child to emulate you. Teachers who are demanding - whose students say of them, “My teacher accepts nothing less than our best effort,” and “Students in this class behave the way my teacher wants them to” - produce measurable year-to-year gains in the academic skills of their students. Teachers who are supportive and respectful - whose students say, “My teacher seems to know if something is bothering me,” and “My teacher wants us to share our thoughts” - enhance students’ happiness, voluntary effort in class, and college aspirations. The ballet studio, the recital hall, the dojo, the basketball court, the gridiron - these are the playing fields of grit. First, there’s an adult in charge - ideally, a supportive and demanding one - who is not the parent. Second, these pursuits are designed to cultivate interest, practice, purpose, and hope. As soon as your child is old enough, you find something they might enjoy doing outside of class and sign them up. Engage in at least one extracurricular activity of their choice. I found myself enthusiastically praising my children no matter what they did. And this is one of the reasons extracurricular activities offer superior playing fields for grit - coaches and teachers are tasked with bringing forth grit in children who are not their own. Require that they stick with at least one activity for more than a year. They’re especially beneficial when we do them for more than a year. In fact, lessons learned while working to improve from one season to the next come up repeatedly in my interviews with paragons of grit. Kids who spend more than a year in extracurriculars are significantly more likely to graduate from college and, as young adults, to volunteer in their communities. Follow-through in high school extracurriculars predicted graduating from college with academic honors better than any variable. Likewise, follow-through was the single best predictor of holding an appointed or elected leadership position in young adulthood. Following through on our commitments while we grow up both requires grit and, at the same time, builds it. Personalities do, in fact, change after childhood. Everyone - including Mom and Dad - has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. The second part of the Hard Thing Rule: You can quit. But you can’t quit until the season is over, the tuition payment is up, or some other “natural” stopping point has arrived. You must, at least for the interval to which you’ve committed yourself, finish whatever you begin. You can’t quit on a bad day. In high school, a fourth requirement will be added: each kid must commit to at least one activity, either something new or the piano and viola they’ve already started, for at least two years. A typical Finn is an obstinate sort of fellow who believes in getting the better of bad fortune by proving that he can stand worse. Thinking of yourself as someone who is able to overcome tremendous adversity often leads to behavior that confirms that self-conception.","Grit is her word for persistence, focus, endurance, and constant improvement. Great thoughts on this point. If interested in it, also read the books here about deliberate practice."
How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk,Adele Fabe and Elaine Mazlish,1451663889,7,"When kids feel right, they’ll behave right. How do we help them to feel right? By accepting their feelings! “You’re just saying that because you’re tired.” : Steady denial of feelings can confuse and enrage kids. Also teaches them not to know what their feelings are - not to trust them. How do children feel when they have one’s feelings dismissed? To help with feelings: 1. Listen with full attention. 2. Acknowledge their feelings with a word - “Oh” “Mmm” “I see” 3. Give their feelings a name. 4. Give them their wishes in fantasy. When we urge a child to push a bad feeling away - however kindly - the child seems to get only more upset. The child who hears the words for what she is experiencing is deeply comforted. Someone has acknowledged her inner experience. Hold off on giving advice. Instead of giving advice, continue to accept and reflect on your child’s feelings. The father hadn’t asked questions and yet the child had told him the whole story. He hadn’t given one word of advice, and yet the child had worked out his own solution, just by listening and acknowledging his feelings. Equate the boy’s bruised, unhappy feelings with physical bruises. Give serious attention for his hurt feelings as he would for a hurt knee. The question “Why?” only adds to their problem. In addition to their original distress, they must now analyze the cause and come up with a reasonable explanation. At other times they’re reluctant to tell because they fear that in the adult’s eyes their reason won’t seem good enough. (“For that you’re crying?”) It’s easier to talk to a grown-up who accepts what you’re feeling rather than one who presses you for explanations. Children don’t need to have their feelings agreed with; they need to have them acknowledged. The statement “You’re absolutely right” might be satisfying to hear for the moment, but it can also prevent a child from thinking things through for himself. To Engage Cooperation: 1. Describe. Describe what you see or describe the problem. 2. Give information. 3. Say it with a word. 4. Talk about your feelings. 5. Write a note. It’s hard to do what needs to be done when people are telling you what’s wrong with you. It’s easier to concentrate on the problem when someone just describes it to you. When children are given information, they can usually figure out for themselves what needs to be done. The shorter the reminder, the better. Alternatives to Punishment: 1. Point out a way to be helpful. 2. Express strong disapproval (without attacking character). 3. State your expectations. 4. Show the child how to make amends. 5. Offer a choice. 6. Take action. 7. Allow the child to experience the consequences of his misbehavior. To Problem-Solve: 1. Talk about the child’s feelings and needs. 2. Talk about your feelings and needs. 3. Brainstorm together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 4. Write down all ideas - without evaluating. 5. Decide which suggestions you like, which you don’t like, and which you plan to follow through on. when people are placed in dependent positions, along with a small amount of gratitude they usually do experience massive feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, resentment, frustration, and anger. To Encourage Autonomy: 1. Let children make choices. 2. Show respect for a child’s struggle. 3. Don’t ask too many questions. 4. Don’t rush to answer questions. 5. Encourage children to use sources outside the home. 6. Don’t take away hope. Praise and Self-Esteem: Instead of Evaluating (“Good” . . . “Great!” . . . “Fantastic!”), Describe. 1. Describe what you see. “I see a clean floor, a smooth bed, and books neatly lined up on the shelf.” 2. Describe what you feel. “It’s a pleasure to walk into this room!” 3. Sum up the child’s praiseworthy behavior with a word. “You sorted out your Legos, cars, and farm animals, and put them in separate boxes. That’s what I call organization!” To Free Children from Playing Roles 1. Look for opportunities to show the child a new picture of himself or herself. 2. Put children in situations where they can see themselves differently. 3. Let children overhear you say something positive about them. 4. Model the behavior you’d like to see. 5. Be a storehouse for your child’s special moments. 6. When your child behaves according to the old label, state your feelings and/or your expectations.",Great thoughts on acknowledging kids' feelings.
The Gardener and the Carpenter,Alison Gopnik,0374229708,7,"I would not evaluate the quality of an old friendship by whether my friend was happier or more successful than when we first met. The most important rewards of being a parent come from the moment-by-moment physical and psychological joy of being with this particular child, and in that child’s moment-by-moment joy in being with you. Love’s purpose is not to shape our beloved’s destiny, but to help them shape their own. Don't change the people we love, but give them what they need to thrive. The purpose of loving children is to give those helpless young human beings a rich, stable, safe environment - an environment in which variation, innovation, and novelty can blossom. Our adult children are and should be foreigners - inhabitants of the future. Childhood is designed to be a period of variability and possibility, exploration and innovation, learning and imagination. Being a parent is like being a gardener. Being a good parent can help create a new generation that is robust and adaptable and resilient, better able to deal with the inevitable, unpredictable changes that face them in the future. Our job is not to shape our children’s minds; it’s to let those minds explore all the possibilities that the world allows. Our job is not to tell children how to play; it’s to give them the toys and pick the toys up again after the kids are done. We can’t make children learn, but we can let them learn. Parents are not designed to shape their children’s lives. Instead, parents provide the next generation with a protected space in which they can produce new ways of thinking and acting that, for better or worse, are entirely unlike any that we would have anticipated beforehand. The virtues of chaos - variability, stochasticity, noise, entropy, randomness, disorder - are the wellspring of freedom, innovation, and creativity. A system that shifts and varies, even randomly, can adapt to a changing world in a more intelligent and flexible way. Children influence the way their parents behave as much as parents influence children. Young brains are designed to explore; old brains are designed to exploit. Meet variability with variability by varying how they think and develop, and what they learn from others. Having different people take care of children also ensures that children are exposed to a wide variety of information and models. The variability of each child’s own temperament stand a better chance of survival when things change. Children actively interpret and try to understand both what people do and why they do it. Children actually learn more from the unconscious details of what caregivers do than from any of the conscious manipulations of parenting. Children learn by watching and imitating the people around them. And they learn by listening to what other people say about how the world works. The cure for imposter syndrome is to realize that all the other people are just convincing imposters, too. Children imitate only intentional actions. They try to reproduce what the actor wanted to do - not just the action itself. Children not only imitate, they overimitate. Children seem to assume that other people are out to teach them important things about the world unless they get direct evidence to the contrary. Adults explicitly mark the supernatural by using phrases such as “I believe.” No one ever says, “I believe in oranges.” Children really do want answers to their questions, really do look for good explanations, and really do learn from them. Children don’t just want more information about the world; they want causal information that will let them understand the world in a deeper and broader way - information that will enable future learning. Early rough-and-tumble play is associated with better social competence later on. Good scientists should be more interested in evidence that contradicts their theories than evidence that confirms them. Figuring out what’s going on in other people’s minds: It’s the most important kind of learning people ever do. People who read a great deal of fiction are consistently more empathetic and better at understanding other people. Teaching seemed to discourage the children from discovering all the possibilities the toy had to offer. The children were more eager to imitate the teacher than to discover things themselves. When the adult said that she had no idea how the toy worked, the children discovered the more intelligent strategy. Imagine if we taught baseball the way we teach science. Until they were twelve, children would read about baseball technique and history, and occasionally hear inspirational stories of the great baseball players. They would fill out quizzes about baseball rules. College undergraduates might be allowed, under strict supervision, to reproduce famous historic baseball plays. But only in the second or third year of graduate school, would they, at last, actually get to play a game. Managing wide-ranging networks of friendships and alliances, divisions of labor, negotiations, compromises, and interests is among our most significant human challenges. When school-age children play with their friends, they are developing these abilities. Games that children organize themselves are more interesting and profound. Socrates feared that reading and writing would undermine the kind of interactive, critical dialogue that was so important for reflective thought. Socrates was completely right. On balance, though, the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. The shift to new technologies and cultures wouldn’t be possible if caregivers didn’t pass on their own discoveries, traditions, skills, and values to their children, even if they can’t and shouldn’t expect that children will simply replicate those traditions. We give children a structured, stable environment, and that’s exactly what allows them to be variable, random, unpredictable, and messy. We give them a world to re-create. A parent is a person whose self has been expanded to include the values and interests of another person, even when those values and interests are different from his.",Great philosophy of parenting.
The Inevitable,Kevin Kelly,0525428089,7,"Our greatest invention in the past 200 years was the scientific process itself. Once we invented the scientific method, we could immediately create thousands of other amazing things we could have never discovered any other way. This methodical process of constant change and improvement was a million times better than inventing any particular product, because the process generated a million new products over the centuries since we invented it. Get the ongoing process right and it will keep generating ongoing benefits. In our new era, processes trump products. Listen to the direction the technologies lean, and bend our expectations, regulations, and products to these fundamental tendencies within that technology. We keep inventing new things that make new longings, make holes in our heart. One day we (all of us) decided that we could not live another day unless we had a smartphone. This discontent is the trigger for our ingenuity and growth. When we imagine a better future, we should factor in this constant discomfort. A world without discomfort is utopia. But it is also stagnant. Utopia has no problems to solve, but therefore no opportunities either. The web in 2050 will have become something new, as different from the web today as the first web was from TV. Hyperlinks will keep expanding to connect all the bits. Rather than flick through stacks of friends’ snapshots on your phone, you ask it about a friend. The internet feels saturated with apps, platforms, devices, and more than enough content. But the internet is still at the beginning. All these miraculous inventions are waiting for that crazy, no-one-told-me-it-was-impossible visionary to start grabbing the low-hanging fruit - the equivalent of the dot-com names of 1984. The graybeards in 2050 will tell you: Can you imagine how awesome it would have been to be an innovator in 2016? It was a wide-open frontier! You could pick almost any category and add some AI to it, put it on the cloud. Few devices had more than one or two sensors in them, unlike the hundreds now. Expectations and barriers were low. It was easy to be the first. And then they would sigh. “Oh, if only we realized how possible everything was back then!” There has never been a better day in the whole history of the world to invent something. There has never been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/risk ratios, better returns, greater upside than now. There’s nothing as consequential as a dumb thing made smarter. At the rate AI technology is improving, a kid born today will rarely need to see a doctor to get a diagnosis by the time they are an adult. The AI on the horizon looks more like Amazon Web Services - cheap, reliable, industrial-grade digital smartness running behind everything, and almost invisible. There is almost nothing we can think of that cannot be made new, different, or more valuable by infusing it with some extra IQ. In fact, the business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: Take X and add AI. Imagine project management software that is smart enough to take into account weather forecasts, port traffic delays, currency exchange rates, accidents, in addition to design changes. Intelligence has to be taught. The rocket engine is the learning algorithms but the fuel is the huge amounts of data we can feed to these algorithms. Chess grand master Garry Kasparov pioneered the concept of man-plus-machine matches, in which AI augments human chess players rather than competes against them. “Centaur,” which is the human/AI cyborg that Kasparov advocated, will listen to the moves suggested by the AI but will occasionally override them - much the way we use the GPS. Today the best chess player alive is a centaur. It goes by the name of Intagrand, a team of several humans and several different chess programs. AI can help humans become better chess players, better pilots, better doctors, better judges, better teachers. Our most important mechanical inventions are not machines that do what humans do better, but machines that can do things we can’t do at all. Every achievement in AI redefines that success as “not AI.” But we label it “machine learning.” Each step of surrender - we are not the only mind that can play chess, fly a plane, make music, or invent a mathematical law - will be painful and sad. We’ll spend the next century - in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves what humans are good for. AIs will help us define who we are. 70 percent of today’s occupations will likewise be replaced by automation - including the job you hold. As manufacturing costs sink because of robots, the costs of transportation become a far greater factor than the cost of production. Nearby will be cheap. So we’ll get this network of locally franchised factories, where most things will be made within five miles of where they are needed. Autopilot can fly a 787 jet unaided for all but seven minutes of a typical flight. We place human pilots in the cockpit to fly those seven minutes and for “just in case” insurance. The fewer humans touching our car as it is being made, the better. Humans have trouble making a single brass screw unassisted, but automation can produce a thousand exact ones per hour. Jobs that require degrees of precision, control, and unwavering attention that our animal bodies don’t possess. We are giving them jobs we could never do. Without them, these jobs would remain undone. Industrialization led a greater percentage of the population to be ballerinas, full-time musicians, mathematicians, athletes, fashion designers, yoga masters. Over time the machines will do these as well. We’ll then be empowered to dream up yet more answers to the question “What should we do?” Success will go to those who best optimize the process of working with bots and machines. Our human assignment will be to keep making jobs for robots - and that is a task that will never be finished. The Seven Stages of Robot Replacement: 1. A robot/computer cannot possibly do the tasks I do. 2. OK, it can do a lot of those tasks, but it can’t do everything I do. 3. OK, it can do everything I do, except it needs me when it breaks down, which is often. 4. OK, it operates flawlessly on routine stuff, but I need to train it for new tasks. 5. OK, OK, it can have my old boring job, because it’s obvious that was not a job that humans were meant to do. 6. Wow, now that robots are doing my old job, my new job is much more interesting and pays more! 7. I am so glad a robot/computer cannot possibly do what I do now. You’ll be paid in the future based on how well you work with robots. The first version of a new medium imitates the medium it replaces. The first commercial computers employed the metaphor of the office: “desktop” and “folders” and “files.” When copies are free, you need to sell things that cannot be copied. Well, what can’t be copied? Trust. Since we prefer to deal with someone we can trust, we will often pay a premium for that privilege. We call that branding. Brand companies can command higher prices for similar products and services from companies without brands because they are trusted for what they promise. So trust is an intangible that has increasing value. HERE ARE GENERATIVES THAT ARE BETTER THAN FREE: IMMEDIACY: getting a copy delivered to your inbox the moment it is released - or even better, produced - by its creators is a generative asset. People go to see films on the opening night, where they will pay a hefty price to see a film that later will be available for free. PERSONALIZATION INTERPRETATION: selling instruction and paid support for free software. When a copy of your DNA costs nothing, the interpretation of what it means, what you can do about it, will be expensive. AUTHENTICITY: an authentic copy. ACCESSIBILITY: available free elsewhere, but it is just not as convenient, channeled to any of my many devices, with a super user interface. EMBODIMENT: music in a live performance, the music is free, the bodily performance expensive. PATRONAGE: fans want to pay creators. it allows them to connect with people they admire. But they will pay only under four conditions: 1) It must be extremely easy to do 2) The amount must be reasonable 3) There’s clear benefit to them for paying 4) It’s clear the money will directly benefit the creators. DISCOVERABILITY: Unfound masterpieces are worthless. Once something, like music, is digitized, it becomes a liquid Now you could filter it, bend it, archive it, rearrange it, remix it, mess with it. It wasn’t only that it was monetarily free; it was freed from constraints. A copy can be linked, manipulated, annotated, tagged, highlighted, bookmarked, translated, and enlivened by other media. Recall, annotate, personalize, edit, authenticate, display, mark, transfer, and engage a work. Podcast: a sort of audible documentary. Films that you might be able to see once in your life you could now study by watching hundreds of times. A hundred million people became film students, starting to make their own videos and uploading them to YouTube. The pattern will spread to transportation, agriculture, health care. Fixities such as vehicles, land, and medicines will become flows. Land will become a substrate for a network of sensors. Medicines will become molecular information capsules flowing from patient to doctor and back. The Four Stages of Flowing: 1. Fixed. Rare. 2. Free. Ubiquitous. 3. Flowing. Sharing: an unbundling of the product into parts 4. Opening. Becoming. Amateurs create new products and brand-new categories of products. The audience is now the artist. I can get parts of the songs as small as a chord. A song’s assets are divvied up one channel at a time. The myriad components of each movie are released in pieces: the sound effects, the special effects (before and after) of each scene, alternative camera views. In Beethoven’s day, few people ever heard one of his symphonies more than once. Printing expanded the number of words available, from about 50,000 words in Old English to a million today. Culture clash between People of the Book and People of the Screen: People of the Book favor solutions by laws, while People of the Screen favor technology as a solution to all problems. Screen culture is a world of constant flux, of endless sound bites, quick cuts, half-baked ideas, floating first impressions. Notions don’t stand alone but are massively interlinked to everything else. Truth is assembled in real time piece by piece - as liquid and open-ended as a Wikipedia page. The clash between the cultures of books and screens occurs within us as individuals as well. If you are an educated modern person, you are conflicted by these two modes. This tension is the new norm. We now read words floating nonlinearly: call this new activity “screening” rather than reading. Screening includes reading words, but also watching words and reading images. When you are engaged in this reading space, your brain works differently than when you are screening. Neurological studies show that learning to read changes the brain’s circuitry. Instead of skipping around distractedly gathering bits, when you read you are transported, focused, immersed. A book is an attention unit. A fact is interesting, an idea is important, but only a story, a good argument, a well-crafted narrative is amazing, never to be forgotten. The status of a new creation is determined by the degree to which it is linked to the rest of the world. Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening. Every year I own less of what I use. Possession is not as important as it once was. Accessing is more important than ever. Pretend you live inside the world’s largest rental store. Why would you own anything? Dematerialization: The trend in the past 30 years has been to make better stuff using fewer materials. To access a service, a customer is often committing to it in a far stronger way than when he or she purchases an item. * Tools as service (TechShop) * Clothes as service (Stitch Fix, Bombfell) * Toys as service (Nerd Block, Sparkbox) * Furniture as service * Health as service * Shelter as service * Vacation as service * School as service. * Uber for flowers (Florist Now, ProFlowers, BloomThat) * Uber for laundry * Uber for lawn mowing (Mowdo, Lawnly) * Uber for tech support (Geekatoo) * Uber for doctor house calls Even Amazon has gotten into the business of matching pros with joes who need home services (Amazon Home Services), from cleaning or setting up equipment to access to goat grazing for lawns. There are so many more ways to be a service than to be a product. Unbundle the benefits of any (X) into separate constituent goods and then recombine them in new ways. Decentralized businesses are very easy to start, with low cost of entry. If these innovative business models are proven to work, established companies are ready to adapt. There is no reason a rental car company like Hertz can’t rent freelancers cars, and no reason why taxi companies can’t implement aspects of Uber. Now that most people are equipped with a supercomputer in their pocket, entirely new economic forces are being unleashed. If smartly connected, a crowd of amateurs can be as good as the average solo professional. If smartly connected, the benefits of existing products can be unbundled and remixed in unexpected and delightful ways. If smartly connected, products melt into services that can be accessed continuously. If smartly connected, accessing is the default. The long-term trend in our modern lives is that most goods and services will be short-term use. We are at the midpoint in a hundred-year scramble toward greater decentralization. Maintaining the idea of ownership within a platform becomes problematic, because it rests on notions of “private property”; but neither “private” nor “property” has great meaning in an ecosystem. The chief reason to put things onto the cloud is to share their data deeply. Woven together, the bits are made much smarter and more powerful than they could possibly be alone. The arty pictures on my wall keep changing so I don’t take them for granted. 3-D sculptures that reconfigure themselves each month so you keep noticing them. The digital native is free to race ahead and explore the unknown. Accessing rather than owning. It would consume more than a year’s worth of our attention to merely preview all the new things that have been invented or created in the previous 24 hours. The danger of being rewarded with only what you already like, however, is that you can spin into an egotistical spiral, becoming blind to anything slightly different, even if you’d love it. This is called a filter bubble. The technical term is “overfitting.” A filter dedicated to probing one’s dislikes: “people who disliked those, learned to like this one.” Stuff I dislike but should learn to like. Filtering systems will be extended to other decentralized systems beyond media, to services like Uber and Airbnb. Your personal preferences in hotel style, status, and service can easily be ported to another system. A pill-making machine in my kitchen: During the day my biological vitals are tracked with wearable sensors so that the effect of the medicine is measured hourly and then sent for analysis. The next day the dosage of the medicines is adjusted based on the past 24-hour results and a new personalized pill produced. Mass personalized medicine. I never know for sure where my office will be since our startup meets in whatever coworking space is available that day. Translated into 2015 dollars, the average cost to consume one hour of media in 1995, 2010, and 2015 is respectively $3.08, $2.69, and $3.37. That means that the value of our attention has been remarkably stable over 20 years. It seems we have some intuitive sense of what a media experience “should” cost. Email is a system that lets other people add things to my to-do list. The asymmetry of attention in email. Over time, if a technology persists long enough, its costs begin to approach (but never reach) zero. In the goodness of time any particular technological function will act as if it were free. The only things that are increasing in cost are human experiences - which cannot be copied. Humans excel at creating and consuming experiences. This is no place for robots. Growth stems from existing resources that are rearranged to make them more valuable. Growth comes from remixing. Modern technologies are combinations of earlier primitive technologies that have been rearranged and remixed. Hundreds of media genres have been born, remixed out of old genres. All devices need to interact. If a thing does not interact, it will be considered broken. Typical users, Narrative has found, employ this photo diary while they attend conferences, or go on vacation, or want to record an experience. Recalling a conference is ideal. The continuous camera captures the many new people you meet. Better than a business card, you can much more easily recall them years later, and what they talked about, by browsing your lifestream. The photo lifestream is a strong prompt for vacations and family events. Recording in a diary is considered admirable. Recording in a spreadsheet is considered creepy. Those who embrace the internet’s tendency to copy and seek value that can’t be easily copied (through personalization, embodiment, authentication, etc.) tend to prosper, while those who deny, prohibit, and try to thwart the network’s eagerness to copy are left behind. There’s no stopping the science fiction levels of tracking. When AIs can understand movies, we’ll be able to repurpose the zillionbytes of that visual information in entirely new ways. Entirely new industries have sprung up in the last two decades based on the idea of unbundling. The music industry was overturned by technological startups that enabled melodies to be unbundled from songs and songs unbundled from albums. Big general-interest newspapers were unbundled into classifieds (Craigslist), stock quotes (Yahoo!), gossip (BuzzFeed), restaurant reviews (Yelp), and stories (the web) that stood and grew on their own. The greatest surprise brought by Wikipedia is that we still don’t know how far this power can go. We haven’t seen the limits of wiki-ized intelligence. Can it make textbooks, music, and movies? What about law and political governance? Wikipedia is impossible, but here it is. It is one of those things that is impossible in theory but possible in practice. Old impossibilities appearing as new possibilities daily. The impossible things happening now are in every case due to the emergence of a new level of organization that did not exist before. eBay reputation status: That lowly innovation opened up a new kind of higher-level coordination that permitted a new kind of exchange (remote purchasing among strangers) that was impossible before. The “revert log” button on Wikipedia, which made it easier to restore a vandalized passage than to vandalize it. What is natural for a tribe of mildly connected humans will not be natural for a planet of intensely connected humans. Every minute a new impossible thing is uploaded to the internet and that improbable event becomes just one of hundreds of extraordinary events that we’ll see or hear about today. That light of superness changes us. We no longer want mere normal. We want the best, greatest, most extraordinary - the highlights of the highlights, the most amazing. This ocean of extraordinariness is inspiring and daring ordinary folks to try something extraordinary. The conflation of play and work, of thinking hard and thinking playfully, is one of the greatest things this new invention has done. To steer a kayak on white-water rapids you need to be paddling at least as fast as the water runs. To navigate the disruption coming at us, you need to be flowing as fast as the frontier is flowing. The paradox of science is that every answer breeds at least two new questions. The best questions are not questions that lead to answers. A good question is worth a million good answers. A good question is not concerned with a correct answer. A good question cannot be answered immediately. A good question challenges existing answers. A good question is one you badly want answered once you hear it, but had no inkling you cared before it was asked. A good question creates new territory of thinking. A good question reframes its own answers. A good question is the seed of innovation in science, technology, art, politics, and business. A good question is a probe, a what-if scenario. A good question skirts on the edge of what is known and not known, neither silly nor obvious. A good question cannot be predicted. A good question will be the sign of an educated mind. A good question is one that generates many other good questions. A good question may be the last job a machine will learn to do. A good question is what humans are for.","What are today's technologies inevitably going to lead to? Great predictions. Half of it was super-inspiring, painting a vision of the future that made me want to jump on it. Half felt like “well, duh, obviously!” maybe because I'm already deep in it."
Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise,Anders Ericsson,0544456238,7,"Perfect pitch: adaptability in the brain disappears by the time a child passes about six years old. There’s no such thing as a predefined ability. Books leave the impression that heartfelt desire and hard work alone will lead to improved performance - “Just keep working at it, and you’ll get there” - and this is wrong. The right sort of practice carried out over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement. Nothing else. Gaining expertise is largely a matter of improving one’s mental processes. The usual approach: We start off with a general idea of what we want to do, get some instruction from a teacher or a coach or a book or a website, practice until we reach an acceptable level, and then let it become automatic. Once you have reached this satisfactory skill level and automated your performance, you have stopped improving. A person who’s been at it for twenty years is likely to be a bit worse than the one who’s been doing it for only five, and the reason is that these automated abilities gradually deteriorate in the absence of deliberate efforts to improve. Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals. “Play the piece all the way through at the proper speed without a mistake three times in a row.” Without such a goal, there was no way to judge whether the practice session had been a success. Break it down and make a plan: What exactly do you need to do. Putting a bunch of baby steps together to reach a longer-term goal. You seldom improve much without giving the task your full attention. Purposeful practice involves feedback. You have to know whether you are doing something right and, if not, how you’re going wrong. Purposeful practice requires getting out of one’s comfort zone. This is perhaps the most important part. I would challenge him with longer and longer strings of digits so that he was always close to his capacity. If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve. The best way to get past any barrier is to come at it from a different direction. Maintaining the focus and the effort required by purposeful practice is hard work, and it is generally not fun. So the issue of motivation inevitably comes up. Purposeful practice in a nutshell: Get outside your comfort zone but do it in a focused way, with clear goals, a plan for reaching those goals, and a way to monitor your progress. Oh, and figure out a way to maintain your motivation. Presbyopia: American and Israeli neuroscientists and vision researchers, was reported in 2012. Training exercises taught the subjects’ brains to do a better job of processing, which in turn allowed the subjects to discern smaller details without any improvement in the signal from the eyes. When you engage in a sustained, vigorous physical activity that pushes the body beyond the point where the homeostatic mechanisms can compensate. Newly activated genes will switch on or ramp up various biochemical systems within the cell, which will change its behavior in ways that are intended to respond to the fact that the cells and surrounding systems have been pushed out of their comfort zone. This is the general pattern for how physical activity creates changes in the body: when a body system - certain muscles, the cardiovascular system, or something else - is stressed to the point that homeostasis can no longer be maintained, the body responds with changes that are intended to reestablish homeostasis. You have to keep upping the ante: run farther, run faster, run uphill. If you don’t keep pushing and pushing and pushing some more, the body will settle into homeostasis, albeit at a different level than before, and you will stop improving. On the other hand, pushing too hard for too long can lead to burnout and ineffective learning. The brain, like the body, changes most quickly in that sweet spot where it is pushed outside - but not too far outside - its comfort zone. Training can have larger effects in younger people. Training at early ages can actually shape the course of later development, leading to significant changes. Suppose you’ve never heard of a dog: it is just a label for this collection of disconnected knowledge. Dogs are furry, they have four legs. However, as you spend time around dogs and start to understand them, all this information becomes integrated into one holistic concept that is represented by the word dog. Now when you hear that word, you don’t have to search your memory banks to remember all the various details about dogs; instead, all that information is immediately accessible. You have added dog not only to your vocabulary but to your set of mental representations. Much of deliberate practice involves developing ever more efficient mental representations that you can use in whatever activity you are practicing. There is no such thing as developing a general skill. You don’t train your memory; you train your memory for strings of digits or for collections of words or for people’s faces. You don’t train to become an athlete; you train to become a gymnast or a sprinter or a marathoner or a swimmer. The main thing that sets experts apart from the rest of us is that their years of practice have changed the neural circuitry in their brains to produce highly specialized mental representations, which in turn make possible the incredible memory, pattern recognition, problem solving, and other sorts of advanced abilities needed to excel in their particular specialties. A hallmark of expert performance is the ability to see patterns in a collection of things that would seem random or confusing to people with less well developed mental representations. Expert writers do it very differently. Consider how my coauthor and I put this book together. First we had to figure out what we wanted the book to do. What did we want readers to learn about expertise? What concepts and ideas were important to introduce? How should a reader’s ideas about training and potential be changed by reading this book? Answering questions like these gave us our first rough mental representation of the book - our goals for it, what we wanted it to accomplish. Next we started sketching out how we would accomplish our goals for the book. What general topics did we need to cover? Obviously we needed to explain what deliberate practice is. How would we do that? Well, first we would need to explain how people normally practice and the limitations of that approach, and then we would discuss purposeful practice, and so on. At that point we were envisioning various approaches we could use to reach our goals for the book and weighing them, seeing which options seemed best. As we made our choices, we gradually honed our mental representation of the book until we had something that seemed to meet all of our goals. The simplest way to imagine our mental representation at this stage is to think back to the old outlining technique you learned back in junior high English class. We prepared an outline of chapters, each focused on a particular topic and covering various aspects of that topic. But the representation of the book that we had created was far richer and more complex than a simple outline. We knew, for instance, why each piece was there and what we wanted to accomplish with it. And we had a clear idea of the book’s structure and logic - why one topic followed another - and the interconnections among the various pieces. To write well, develop a mental representation ahead of time to guide your efforts, then monitor and evaluate your efforts and be ready to modify that representation as necessary. How well the students were able to detect their mistakes. The relationship between skill and mental representations is a virtuous circle: the more skilled you become, the better your mental representations are, and the better your mental representations are, the more effectively you can practice to hone your skill. Honing the skill improves mental representation, and mental representation helps hone the skill. There is a bit of a chicken-and-egg component to this. Take figure skating: it’s hard to have a clear mental representation of what a double axel feels like until you’ve done it, and, likewise, it is difficult to do a clean double axel without a good mental representation of one. That sounds paradoxical, but it isn’t really. You work up to a double axel bit by bit, assembling the mental representations as you go. It’s like a staircase that you climb as you build it. Each step of your ascent puts you in a position to build the next step. Some activities, such as playing music in pop music groups, solving crossword puzzles, and folk dancing, have no standard training approaches. Whatever methods there are seem slapdash and produce unpredictable results. Other activities, like classical music performance, mathematics, and ballet, are blessed with highly developed, broadly accepted training methods. If one follows these methods carefully and diligently, one will almost surely become an expert. These fields have several characteristics in common. First, there are always objective ways - such as the win/loss of a chess competition or a head-to-head race - or at least semiobjective ways - such as evaluation by expert judges - to measure performance. If there is no agreement on what good performance is and no way to tell what changes would improve performance, then it is very difficult - often impossible - to develop effective training methods. These fields tend to be competitive enough that performers have strong incentive to practice and improve. The time they had spent practicing before the age of eighteen - an average of 7,336 hours - was almost identical to what the best violin students in the music academy had reported. Deliberate practice is different from other sorts of purposeful practice in two important ways: First, it requires a field that is already reasonably well developed. What areas don’t qualify? Pretty much anything in which there is little or no direct competition, such as manager, teacher, electrician, engineer, consultant, because there are no objective criteria for superior performance. Deliberate practice requires a teacher who can provide practice activities. A clear distinction between purposeful practice - in which a person tries very hard to push himself or herself to improve - and practice that is both purposeful and informed. Deliberate practice requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his or her current abilities. Thus it demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable. Well-defined, specific goals, improving some aspect of the target performance. Small changes will add up to the desired larger change. Once you have identified an expert, identify what this person does differently from others that could explain the superior performance. Art Turock from Kirkland, Washington, worked to understand the principles of deliberate practice and incorporate them into his training and coaching of corporate leaders. Normal business activities can be transformed into practice activities. Benefit from practicing something over and over again “offline” - that is, away from their real job, where mistakes have real consequences, using simulators. This distinction between knowledge and skills lies at the heart of the difference between traditional paths toward expertise and the deliberate-practice approach. The traditional approach has been to provide information about the right way to proceed and then mostly rely on the student to apply that knowledge. Deliberate practice, by contrast, focuses solely on performance and how to improve it. The main reasons are tradition and convenience: it is much easier to present knowledge to a large group of people than it is to set up conditions under which individuals can develop skills through practice. Doctors’ performance grew worse over time. Older doctors knew less and did worse in terms of providing appropriate care than doctors with far fewer years of experience. The right question is, How do we improve the relevant skills? rather than, How do we teach the relevant knowledge? Get some personal sessions with a coach who could give advice tailored to your performance. An experienced teacher watching you and providing feedback. Someone who knows the best order in which to learn things. If you want to improve in chess, you don’t do it by playing chess; you do it with solitary study of the grandmasters’ games. If you want to improve in darts, you don’t do it by going to the bar. You do it by spending some time alone working on reproducing your throwing motion exactly from one throw to the next. If your mind is wandering or you’re relaxed and just having fun, you probably won’t improve. The difference lay in how the two groups had approached the lesson. For the amateurs it was a time to express themselves, to sing away their cares, and to feel the pure joy of singing. For the professionals, the lesson was a time to concentrate on such things as vocal technique and breath control in an effort to improve their singing. There was focus but no joy. Long-distance runners: amateurs tend to daydream or think about more pleasant subjects to take their minds off the pain and strain of their running, while elite long-distance runners remain attuned to their bodies so that they can find the optimal pace and make adjustments to maintain the best pace throughout the whole race. Shorter training sessions with clearer goals are the best way to develop new skills faster. It is better to train at 100 percent effort for less time than at 70 percent effort for a longer period. Benjamin Franklin: teaching himself how to write as well as the writers of The Spectator. He'd see how closely he could reproduce the sentences in an article once he had forgotten their exact wording. He wrote down short descriptions of the content of each sentence. After several days he tried to reproduce the articles from the hints, to create his own articles that were as detailed and well written. He went back to the original articles, compared them with his own efforts, and corrected his versions where necessary. This taught him to express ideas clearly and cogently. He wrote the hints on separate pieces of paper and then jumbled them so that they were completely out of order. Then he waited long enough that not only had he forgotten the wording of the sentences in the original articles, but he had also forgotten their order, and he tried once again to reproduce the articles. The exercise forced him to think carefully about how to order the thoughts. Students who were trying to improve their English would watch the same English movies with subtitles over and over again, covering the subtitles and trying to understand what was being said. By listening to the same dialogue over and over, they improved their ability to understand English much more quickly than if they’d simply watched a number of different movies. Focus. Feedback. Fix it. Break the skill down into components that you can do repeatedly and analyze effectively, determine your weaknesses, and figure out ways to address them. A plateau: the best way to move beyond it is to challenge your brain or your body in a new way. Cross-training of any sort is based on the same principle - switch off between different types of exercise so that you are constantly challenging yourself in different ways. When you reach a point at which you are having difficulty getting better, it will be just one or two of the components of that skill, not all of them, that are holding you back. The question is, Which ones? To figure that out, you need to find a way to push yourself a little - not a lot - harder than usual. This will often help you figure out where your sticking points are. Push yourself well outside of your comfort zone and see what breaks down first. Then design a practice technique aimed at improving that particular weakness. Both willpower and natural talent are traits that people assign to someone after the fact. It is much more useful, I believe, to talk about motivation. The ones who are successful in losing weight over the long run are those who have successfully redesigned their lives, building new habits that allow them to maintain the behaviors that keep them losing weight in spite of all of the temptations that threaten their success. A similar thing is true for those who maintain purposeful or deliberate practice over the long run. They have generally developed various habits that help them keep going. Strengthen the reasons to keep going or weaken the reasons to quit. Set aside a fixed time to practice that has been cleared of all other obligations and distractions. When these future experts were young, their parents would use various strategies to keep them from quitting. They realized that they could indeed keep getting better and that their setback was just temporary. Belief is important. The only way that a child of that age (she was three at the time) could become interested: she saw the chess pieces as fun. As toys. As something to play with. Young children are very curious and playful. Like puppies or kittens, they interact with the world mostly through play. This desire to play serves as a child’s initial motivation to try out one thing or another, to see what is interesting and what is not, and to engage in various activities that will help them build their skills. At this point they’re developing simple skills, of course, but for future experts, this playful interaction with whatever has caught their interest is their first step toward what will eventually become their passion. In the beginning, a child’s parents play with their child at the child’s level, but gradually they turn the play toward the real purpose of the “toy.” They explain the special moves of the chess pieces. They show how the golf club is used to hit the ball. They reveal the piano’s ability to produce a tune rather than just a racket. Parents give their children a great deal of time, attention, and encouragement. Parents tend to be very achievement-oriented and teach their children such values as self-discipline, hard work, responsibility, and spending one’s time constructively. Once a child becomes interested in a particular field, he or she is expected to approach it with those same attributes. Use this initial interest as a springboard to an activity, but that initial curiosity-driven motivation needs to be supplemented. Picked up the particular interests of their parents: a way they could spend time with the parents and share the interest. Parents of children destined for more intellectual pursuits - such as the future mathematicians and future neurologists - were more likely to discuss intellectual topics with their kids. The best teachers didn’t focus on the rules for solving particular problems but rather encouraged their students to think about general patterns and processes - the why more than the how. Brady spent a half hour each day training with the tone generator, and at the end of two months he could identify every one of the twelve notes being played.","After being quoted in many books, the guy who coined “deliberate practice”, and spent his career studying just that, finally writes his own take on it. But I've already loved “The Talent Code”, “The Little Book of Talent”, “Moonwalking with Einstein”, “Talent is Overrated”, and “Little Bets”, which are all about this same field. So I didn't get much new out of it, but if you haven't already read those, maybe start here at the horse's mouth."
Deep Work,Cal Newport,1455586692,7,"Deep Work = Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value and improve your skill. Although he had many patients who relied on him, Jung was not shy about taking time off. Deep work, though a burden to prioritize, was crucial for his goal of changing the world. Neal Stephenson: “If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. If I instead get interrupted a lot, what replaces it? A bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.” Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you permanently reduce your capacity to perform deep work. Our work culture’s shift toward the shallow is exposing a massive personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth. “A succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance.” In other words, talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: There’s a premium to being the best. What deliberate practice actually requires: (1) your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive. Why deliberate practice works: By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers the wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits - effectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn a complex new skill in a state of low concentration, you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strengthen. To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. If you’re comfortable going deep, you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn’t expect these systems and skills to come easily to you. Batch hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches. Grant performs this batching at multiple levels. Within the year, he stacks his teaching into the fall semester, during which he can turn all of his attention to teaching well and being available to his students. Then turns his attention fully to research in the spring and summer, and tackle this work with less distraction. Within a semester dedicated to research, he alternates between periods where his door is open to students and colleagues, and periods where he isolates himself to focus completely and without distraction on a single research task. High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) By maximizing his intensity when he works, he maximizes the results he produces per unit of time spent working. To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It’s better to hire three smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring their solutions to the executive for a final decision. This specificity is important because it tells us that if you’re a high-level executive at a major company, you probably don’t need the advice in the pages that follow. On the other hand, it also tells us that you cannot extrapolate the approach of these executives to other jobs. There are corners of our economy where depth is not valued: executives, salesmen. Even though you are not aware at the time, the brain responds to distractions. In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. Eudaimonia (a state in which you’re achieving your full human potential) ======= THE EUDAIMONIA MACHINE IS A BUILDING by David Dewane - an architecture professor A space designed for the sole purpose of enabling the deepest possible deep work. Create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing - creating work that’s at the absolute extent of their personal abilities. The structure is a narrow rectangle made up of five rooms, placed in a line. You have to pass through one room to get to the next. First the gallery, to inspire. Next the salon, to debate, “brood,” and work through the ideas. Beyond the salon you enter the library. Next the office space, for low-intensity activity, to complete the shallow efforts required by your project. The final room: deep work chambers. Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick soundproof walls for total focus and uninterrupted work flow. You spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times - at which point your brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day. The Eudaimonia Machine exists only as a collection of architectural drawings, but even as a plan, its potential to support impactful work excites Dewane. “This design remains, in my mind, the most interesting piece of architecture I’ve ever produced,” he told me. ======= Once you accept that deep work is valuable, isn’t it enough to just start doing more of it? People fight desires all day long. The five most common desires fought include eating, sleeping, and sex. But also “taking a break from [hard] work… checking e-mail and social networking sites, surfing the web. You can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do anything but work deeply throughout the day, unless, that is, you’re smart about your habits. Move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life. Minimize the amount of willpower necessary to maintain unbroken concentration. Commit to a particular pattern for scheduling this work and develop rituals to sharpen your concentration before starting each session. Choose a philosophy that fits your circumstances. Donald Knuth: “I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.” “I learn then digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don’t have time for exhaustive study.” The monastic philosophy of deep work scheduling attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. To have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they’re pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well. Neal Stephenson: “All of my time and attention are spoken for - several times over. Please do not ask for them.” Two mutually exclusive options: He can write good novels at a regular rate, or he can answer a lot of individual e-mails and attend conferences, and as a result produce lower-quality novels at a slower rate. Jung did not deploy a monastic approach only during the periods he spent at his retreat. The rest of Jung’s time was spent in Zurich. He ran a busy clinical practice that often had him seeing patients until late at night; he was an active participant in the Zurich coffeehouse culture; and he gave and attended many lectures. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, act monastically - seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. The minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach. Bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits. Jung, for example, needed his clinical practice to pay the bills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to stimulate his thinking. Adam Grant would, perhaps once or twice a month, take a period of two to four days to become completely monastic. Outside of these deep sessions, Grant remained famously open and accessible. The rhythmic philosophy: transform deep work sessions into a simple regular habit. He would wake up and start working by five thirty every morning. He would then work until seven thirty, make breakfast, and go to work: “both astronomically productive and guilt free.” This approach works better with the reality of human nature. If you’re writing with no one pressuring you to get it done, the habitual nature of the rhythmic philosophy might be necessary to maintain progress. The journalist philosophy: in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule. Journalists are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment’s notice. Any time he could find some free time, he would switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at his book. He could retreat up to the bedroom for a while, when the rest of us were chilling on the patio or whatever, to work on his book… he’d go up for twenty minutes or an hour, we’d hear the typewriter pounding, then he’d come down as relaxed as the rest of us… the work never seemed to faze him, he just happily went up to work when he had the spare time. ^ This approach is not for the deep work novice. The single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration. Waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. A curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture. A radical change to your normal environment coupled with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task. MIT physicist and award-winning novelist Alan Lightman retreats each summer to a “tiny island” in Maine. The island not only lacked Internet, but didn’t even have phone service. “Recover some silence which is so hard to find.” Building/ writing cabins: the grand gesture represented in the design and building of the cabin for the sole purpose of enabling better writing. === Clayton Christensen book titled The 4 Disciplines of Execution for successfully implement high-level strategies. Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish. Don’t try to say ‘no’ to the trivial Say ‘yes’ to the ambitious and crowd out everything else. Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures Measure your success: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. they come too late to change your behavior Lead measures measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures. I used to focus on lag measures, such as papers published per year. These measures, however, lacked influence on my day-to-day behavior because there was nothing I could do in the short term that could immediately generate a noticeable change to this long-term metric. When I shifted to tracking deep work hours, suddenly these measures became relevant. Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard I kept track of the hours spent in deep work, and taped it to the wall next to my computer monitor (where it couldn’t be ignored), circled the hour where I finished an important milestone. It helped calibrate my expectations for how many hours of deep work were needed per result. Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability Weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead. Execution is more difficult than strategizing. These basic disciplines seem to work particularly well in conquering this difficulty. ==== Serious efforts that produce things the world values need the support of a mind regularly released to leisure. Some decisions are better left to your unconscious. To actively try to work through these decisions will lead to a worse outcome. For decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, use your unconscious. Two groups. One group was asked to take a walk on a wooded path. The other group was sent on a walk through the bustling center of the city. Both groups were then given a concentration-sapping task. The nature group performed up to 20 percent better on the task. Spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate. You can restore your ability to direct your attention if you give this activity a rest. If you keep interrupting your evening to check e-mail, you’re robbing your directed attention centers of the uninterrupted rest they need for restoration. Trying to squeeze a little more work out of your evenings might reduce your effectiveness the next day. Hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. You’re beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Once your workday shuts down, you cannot allow even the smallest incursion of professional concerns into your field of attention. Even a brief intrusion of work can generate a self-reinforcing stream of distraction that impedes the shutdown advantages. Shutdown ritual: every incomplete task, goal, or project either (1) you have a plan you trust for its completion, or (2) it’s captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right. Sounds cheesy, but it provides a simple cue to your mind that it’s safe to release work-related thoughts for the rest of the day. Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction. People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, it’s hard to shake the addiction even when you want to concentrate. If every moment of potential boredom is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where it’s not ready for deep work - even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. An Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted brain. If you eat healthy just one day a week, you’re unlikely to lose weight. If you spend just one day a week resisting distraction, you’re unlikely to diminish your brain’s craving for these stimuli, as most of your time is still spent giving in to it. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. Schedule in advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times. The constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. Keep your self-imposed deadlines right at the edge of feasibility. You should be able to consistently beat the buzzer (or at least be close), but to do so should require teeth-gritting concentration. These dashes are incompatible with distraction (there’s no way you can give in to distraction and still make your deadlines). The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally - walking, jogging, driving, showering - and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Structure Your Deep Thinking: careful review of the relevant variables for solving the problem For example, the main points you want to make in the chapter. Define the specific next-step question you need to answer using these variables. Example “How am I going to effectively open this chapter?,” you now have a specific target for your attention. The final step is to consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified. Facebook: justifications for their use of the service are surprisingly minor. Facebook added one more entertainment option to many that already existed. You might reply that value is value: If you can find some extra benefit in using a service like Facebook - even if it’s small - then why not use it? I call this way of thinking the any-benefit mind-set, as it identifies any possible benefit as sufficient justification for using a network tool. This approach ignores all the negatives that come along with the tools. The craftsman approach to tool selection: Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts. Small number of goals for both the personal and professional areas of your life. Once you’ve identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. ** Using social media for promotion: Imagine that our hypothetical author diligently sends ten individualized tweets a day, five days a week - each of which connects one-on-one with a new potential reader. Now imagine that 50 percent of the people contacted in this manner become loyal fans who will definitely buy the author’s next book. Over the two-year period it might take to write this book, this yields two thousand sales - a modest boost at best in a marketplace where bestseller status requires two or three times more sales per week. The question once again is not whether Twitter offers some benefits, but instead whether it offers enough benefits to offset its drag on your time and attention. Put more thought into your leisure time. Schedule every minute of your day. You’re going to underestimate at first how much time you require for most things. People tend to use their schedule as an incarnation of wishful thinking. If I stumble onto an important insight, then this is a perfectly valid reason to ignore the rest of my schedule for the day. How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task? This question is meant as a thought experiment (I’m not going to ask you to actually hire a recent college graduate to take over tasks that score low). But the answers it provides will help you objectively quantify the shallowness or depth of various activities. Bias your time toward depth. Herbert enforces a small fee you must pay before communicating with him. Centeno’s sender filter lays out a two-step process. If you have a question, he diverts you to a public location to post it. Centeno thinks it’s wasteful to answer the same questions again and again in private one-on-one conversations. Interrogative e-mails generate an initial instinct to dash off the quickest possible response that will clear the message - temporarily - out of your inbox. What is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion? “I’ll live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.”","Crucial subject, dear to me: shutting out distractions for deep productive concentrated work. No huge surprises but great supporting thoughts. I liked the point of considering the downside of the internet, instead of only the positives."
The Geography of Genius,Eric Weiner,1451691653,7,"Creative genius is someone with the ability to come up with ideas that are new, surprising, and valuable. Sir Francis Galton's motto was “Count whenever you can!” To him, anything worth doing was worth doing numerically, and he once confessed that he couldn’t fully grasp a problem unless he was first able to “disembarrass it of words.” There are two types of subjects that a culture studies little: those which it despises and those which it holds dearest. We may be inspired by nature - a walk in the woods, the sound of a waterfall - but something about an urban setting is especially conducive to creativity. It takes a city to raise a genius. Paying attention is the first step on the road to genius. Creativity cannot be separated from its recognition. A variety pack of microcultures blossomed. During times of fragmentation, humanity made its greatest creative leaps. Peoples are more likely to reach their full creative potential when they belong to an independent nation. The ancient Greeks walked everywhere, all the time. They were great walkers and great thinkers and preferred to do their philosophizing while on the go. Creativity levels were consistently and significantly higher for the walkers versus the sitters. They still produced twice as many creative responses compared with the sedentary group. It didn’t take a lot of walking to boost creativity, either - anywhere from five to sixteen minutes. The ancient Greeks did everything outdoors. A house was less a home than a dormitory. They spent only about thirty waking minutes there every day. They spent the rest of their day in the agora, the marketplace, working out at the gymnasium or the palaistra, the wrestling grounds, or perhaps strolling along the rolling hills. The Greeks didn’t differentiate between physical and mental activity. Body and mind were two inseparable parts of a whole. A fit mind not attached to a fit body rendered both somehow incomplete. Buildings were not merely physical entities; they possessed a spirit, that genius loci, or genius of place. Greeks believed that where you were influenced what you thought. The Parthenon has not a single straight line. Each column bends slightly this way or that. No one is aware that the sense of happiness he feels is caused by curves and bends that are almost imperceptible yet immensely powerful. The beholder is unaware that he is responding to a combination of regularity and irregularity the architect had hidden in his work. Chaos is the raw material of creativity. Competition motivates experienced creators but inhibits inexperienced ones. Paradise is antithetical to genius. Paradise makes no demands, and creative genius takes root through meeting demands in new and imaginative ways. The problem with paradise is that it is perfect and therefore requires no response. This is why wealthy people and places often stagnate. One of the prerequisites for a golden age is peace. Socrates occupied that precarious position that all geniuses do - perched between insider and outsider. Far enough outside the mainstream to see the world through fresh eyes, yet close enough so that those fresh insights resonated with others. This doesn’t necessarily mean he fit happily with the spirit of his times. What distinguishes geniuses is the capacity to be able to exploit an apparent misfit. Four stages of the creative process: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Why Athens? Everyone did everything. Amateur hour. They viewed expertise with suspicion, for theirs was the genius of simplicity. All intellectual breakthroughs made the world a little bit simpler. There is this chaotic mess of seemingly unconnected data out there, and then someone says, ‘Wait, here is how it all fits together.’ And we like that. To see anything in relation to other things is to see it simplified. Athens was the world’s first global city. The ancient Greeks didn’t invent much at all. They borrowed the alphabet from the Phoenicians, medicine and sculpture from the Egyptians, mathematics from the Babylonians, literature from the Sumerians. Plato said, “What the Greeks borrow from foreigners they perfect.” This willingness to borrow, steal, and embellish distinguished Athens from its neighbors. Athenians were more open to foreign ideas and, in the final analysis, more open-minded. Athens was both Greek and foreign, in much the way that New York is an American city and not. The Spartans, by comparison, walled themselves off from the outside world, and nothing kills creativity faster than a wall. Psychologists have identified this “openness to experience” as the single most important trait of exceptionally creative people. The same holds true for societies. Ideas shine a bright light on that normally invisible sea called culture. People realize the arbitrary nature of their own culture and open their minds to, in effect, the possibility of possibility. Once you realize that there is another way of doing X, or thinking about Y, then all sorts of new channels open up to you. The awareness of cultural variety helps set the mind free. Athenians tolerated not only strange foreigners but also homegrown eccentrics. Walking quiets the mind without silencing it completely. They did not compete for personal glory but, rather, for the glory of Athens. Anyone who lost sight of that imperative risked exile. Those who had been made to feel rejected scored higher on a creative-thinking exam than those who had not. Rejection confirms what they already feel about themselves, that they’re not like the others. And that confirmation actually drives them to greater creativity. What is honored in a country will be cultivated there. The Song Dynasty, which spanned from 969 to 1276 AD, a time of great flourishing. The dynastic capital, Hangzhou, was the richest, most populous city in the world. The era also produced a bumper crop of great thinkers, unburdened by the sort of brooding that typically accompanies European philosophy. Nothing is more foreign to the Chinese genius than metaphysical anguish and anxiety. The Song Dynasty was China’s Renaissance, Hangzhou its Florence. The city’s “pleasure grounds” were places where you could learn to play the Chinese transverse flute, or take an acting class, or simply marvel at the perennial circus unfolding before your eyes: tightrope walkers, jugglers, sword swallowers, comedians, wrestlers, performing ants. Hangzhou was a city of constant pandemonium. Places of genius require a degree of uncertainty, and perhaps even chaos. One of the greatest myths of innovation: that you can’t stop progress. In fact, we stop progress all the time. If we didn’t, we would be overwhelmed by a flood of novel technologies - some useful, most not. Every city has at least one porthole to the past. The conflicts that plague the political world encourage young developing minds to consider more radical worldviews. This sense of wonder lies at the heart of all scientific inquiry, of life itself. Music psychologist Gary McPherson conducted a revealing study in which he asked children how long they planned on playing their instruments. The single biggest determinant of their performance was simply their degree of long-term commitment. Those in it for the long haul played better than those who were not, even if the short-termers practiced more than the others. If the long-term committed practiced a lot, they improved 400 percent more than the short-term committed. It is a fatal fault to reason whilst observing. See what is before you, the thing itself. Analyze later. Every great genius looks at what everyone else is looking at and sees something different. Only, of course, it is not so simple. We acclimate to our environment so we no longer see it. Creative people are able to avoid this deadening of perception and “make the familiar strange.” The comedian toys with our rational minds and brings about “a momentary fusion between two habitually incompatible matrices.” The punch line comes as a surprise but makes perfect sense. The sudden click of logic makes a joke funny. Robert Frost once likened writing free-verse poetry to playing tennis without a net. Without boundaries, we are lost. We may actually undermine creativity if we make things too easy or too comfortable for individuals of significant creative potential. Nations rich in natural resources, especially oil, tend to stagnate culturally and intellectually, as even a brief visit to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait reveals. The citizens of these nations have everything so they create nothing. Jack Ma sees no future for Chinese creative genius without a reawakening of this sort of timeless philosophy and culture. Patrons, the good kind, do more than write checks. They inspire. They challenge. The Medicis actively encouraged the city’s artists to take risks and placed huge bets that, though they seem wise today, were at the time wildly reckless. “Give me neither poverty nor riches.” Throughout history, the vast majority of geniuses have come from the middle and upper-middle classes. They had enough money to pursue their passions, but not so much that they lapsed into complacency. We are at our most innovative when we have something to push against. Creativity does not require perfect conditions. In fact, it thrives in imperfect ones. “We have no money so we will have to think!” Geniuses of Florence were the natural outcome of an informal, sometimes chaotic system that recognized, cultivated, and, yes, honored talent. Every golden age has its multipliers. These are people whose influence far exceeds their own artistic output. The Velvet Underground, sold only thirty thousand copies, but “everyone who bought one of those thirty thousand albums started a band.” Reed’s influence on the music scene can’t be measured in album sales alone. Ask Verrocchio, though, if he was in the business of producing geniuses and he would no doubt laugh. Genius? He was in the business of business. Whatever his customers wanted, Verrocchio and his minions would make it. Which is not to say they welcomed every assignment with equal enthusiasm. They much preferred clients with taste, but business was business. Nothing was taught in Verrocchio’s workshop, but much was learned. It was education through osmosis. Total immersion. The young apprentice often lived in the same building as the master, Creative thinking. No such thing as genius in the abstract exists, any more than love in the abstract exists. These human inclinations require an object for their attention. Creativity is not a simple result of special types of thinking. It requires thinking about special content - it requires thinking about important questions. Problem solvers answer questions. Problem finders discover new questions, and then answer them. It is these new questions, even more than the answers, that distinguish the genius. Which is why Picasso once quipped, “Computers are stupid. They only give you answers.” Sprezzatura means, literally, a “squirt of something extra.” Archaeologists love mistakes. They reveal process. A perfectly crafted statue tells the archaeologists nothing about how it was made. Mistakes shine a light on the messy world of creative genius and give the lie to the myth of the immaculate artist. The Renaissance brought us not only the world’s first modern geniuses, but also the first modern consumers. These two facts are connected. Ours is not a genuine age of materialism because it has no respect for material. How a nation accumulates wealth matters more than how much it accumulates. Resource-rich nations aren’t innovative for a simple reason: they don’t have to be. Florence had no diamonds or oil, or much of anything else, so people had to rely on their wits and gumption. They had no money so they had to think. Renaissance art - widely hailed as the peak of human accomplishment - began as pure propaganda. Most people were illiterate, so how could the Church reach them? How could it, for instance, depict the birth of Jesus? Captions won’t work. You have to get your message across solely with visual symbols. That is, with paintings, jam-packed with symbolism. Psychologists have identified the exact year when a child’s creative-thinking skills plateau: the fourth grade. Florence’s lack of a university was a blessing. It saved the city from a scholastic straitjacket. All golden ages, contain an element of free-for-all, a chink in time when the old order has crumbled and a new one is not yet cemented. The densest happiness he had ever experienced. Breakthroughs in one field inspire breakthroughs in others, and before you know it, you’re living in a golden age. The number of geniuses who appear in any given field at any given time is a function not of the pool of talent available but, rather, the attractiveness of the field. For instance, far fewer ambitious young people see classical music as the way to make their mark in the world. Janusian thinking as actively conceiving two or more opposite or antithetical ideas, images or concepts simultaneously. These impossible contradictions seem to lie at the heart of creativity. Janusian thinking is not about synthesizing two incompatible ideas but living with their incompatibility. Athens had a population of fewer than one hundred thousand people. Florence was even smaller, and Edinburgh smaller still. Yet these cities spawned so much greatness, outshining much larger rivals. How can this be? A small nation has to grow big balls. Small places, out of necessity, are more likely to direct their eyes outward. Small places are more likely to ask questions. Einstein said, “If we knew what we were doing, we wouldn’t call it research.” To create something worthwhile you must possess a grudging faith that your creation will find an appreciative audience. To create is to have faith not only in the moment but in moments yet to come. That’s why you don’t hear about many nihilists producing creative works. Waiters kept perfect track of orders, but as soon as the plates hit the table, they “deleted” the information. We recall information associated with incomplete tasks much more readily. An unsolved problem boosts our memory and sharpens our thinking. When faced with an unsolved problem, they persist and can’t rest until it is solved. This persistence explains more about creative genius than those apocryphal “aha moments.” The word articulation is derived from a root meaning “joining” or “joint.” To articulate an idea is to cement it, to cocreate it. We cherish the hidden more than the exposed. Talent hits a target no one else can hit; genius hits a target no one else can see. Nothing stifles the spirit of discovery more effectively than the assumption that miracles have ceased. What made, and still makes, Edinburgh so creative is not that it is a nice place but rather that it is difficult. You’ve got something to push against. Instead of having to live up to something, you have to push against something. It forces you to make that extra effort. Places of genius are not only densely populated, they are also intimate, and intimacy always includes a degree of trust. When people from similar backgrounds get together, are isolated from dissenting views, and are trying to please a strong leader, the result is consensus around the preferred position, even if it is clearly wrongheaded. Groupthink is the flip side of group genius. Groupthink is collective stupidity, and every culture is susceptible to it. Groups that tolerate dissent generate more good ideas, even if those dissenting views turn out to be completely wrong. Something about train travel - the rocking motion and the passing scenery, there for you to admire or ignore - lends itself to creative breakthroughs. Drinking was merely a detour, en route to the true destination. Mutual cerebral stimulation. One person makes a comment, say a businessman, and then someone from a very different field adds to that, takes it in an entirely different direction. Every golden age - was interdisciplinary, and all creative breakthroughs the result of mental cross-fertilization between different disciplines. “We’re not talking about conversation as a form of entertainment. We’re talking about conversation as the piling up of premises leading to a conclusion. We’re talking about conversation that takes an issue forward, conversation as a way of getting somewhere.” Picasso was asked if he knew what a painting was going to look like when he started it, and he said, ‘No, of course not. If I knew, I wouldn’t bother doing it.’ Creative atmospheres accepte, and even celebrate, ambiguity. Creative genius involves “superfluidity and backtracking.” Superfluidity is the willingness to pursue hunches that might well turn out to be dead ends. Backtracking is when you return to these supposed dead ends and give them a second look. Geniuses don’t have a higher batting average than the rest of us, but they are able to recall exactly where they missed and why. Einstein knew less physics than many of his contemporaries. Einstein wasn’t a know-it-all. He was a see-it-all. The ability to make unexpected and important connections: breadth, not depth, of knowledge is what matters. The possibility of coincidence is greater here than it is elsewhere. Geniuses are good at exploiting chance. Between roughly 1840 and 1920, Calcutta was one of the world’s great intellectual capitals. The Bengal Renaissance. Everywhere the English go, it seems, they bring nothing but trouble and genius. There is nothing less pure than culture. Calcutta, says the writer Amit Chaudhuri, is “in conflict with itself.” British colonialists spread literacy in India thinking they would get a city of clerks. Instead, they got a city of poets. The one-way streets change directions once a day. (That’s a very interesting time of day.) Nothing sticks to a smooth surface. A certain roughness, and ugliness even, is required in our creative lives. In India, in public, people brush their teeth, urinate, and do all the things that, elsewhere in the world, take place behind closed doors. Life lived so publicly increases the amount and variety of stimulation we’re exposed to. Think of a packed commuter train versus the backseat of a limousine. If creativity is about connecting the dots, then the more dots at our disposal, the better. Private spaces hoard dots. Public spaces are awash in them, and they’re free for the taking. Rabindranath Tagore. Poet, essayist, dramatist, activist, Nobel Prize winner, he embodied the full flowering of the Bengal Renaissance. One day, he showed some doodles to his friend Victoria de Campo, who glanced at them and said, “Why don’t you paint?” So he did. At the age of sixty-seven, with no formal training in art, he painted. And painted. Over the next thirteen years, Tagore produced some three thousand paintings. When confronted with a new odor, the rabbit’s brain entered an “I don’t know state.” This enables the brain to avoid all of its previously learned activities and to produce a new one. Our brains need chaotic states to process new information. There are limits. Too much random stimulation produces anxiety, not genius. We thrive in “chaotic,” stimulating environments. The reason he traveled so much was in order to see properly. Complex, not complicated. Dictionaries define these two words synonymously. They are, in fact, very different. Complicated things can be explained by examining their individual parts. Complex ones cannot. They are always greater than the sum of their parts. A jet engine is complicated. Mayonnaise is complex. People tend to describe themselves as complex and their spouse as complicated. The best state to be poised in is in between two cultures and their productive discourse. The genius of the Indo-Western mind lies not in the Indian or the Western lobes but in the spaces between. Small-c creativity might mean jury-rigging a finicky lawn mower rather than buying a new one, Small-c creativity is important. Not only does it help us get through the day, it also limber us up for big-C creativity, in much the same way that bodybuilders progress to heavier and heavier weights. An adda is something like a book club, only instead of talking about a book, participants can talk about anything. An adda, I realize, is a great forum for asking questions. Rarely does it yield definitive answers. Walk. Get up early, at dawn, and just start walking. Don’t take a lot of money, don’t have a destination in mind. Just walk. Don’t stop walking. You might have an epiphany. Kolkatans have created a unique human configuration: individualism combined with gregariousness. Each one does what he/she wants while enjoying being in a group. The essential characteristic of a highly civilized society is not that it is creative but that it is appreciative. The number of foreigners in the city is so great that one feels simultaneously foreigner and native citizen, Originality is the art of concealing your sources. The pupil who does not surpass his master is mediocre. A city provides distance. A buffer between our old selves and our new. Creative people, research shows, are physiologically more sensitive to stimuli. This helps explain why creative people periodically retreat from the world. Dickens, who, when deep into a manuscript, avoided any social events, for the “mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day.” Creative types engage in a feast-and-famine dynamic. They deprive themselves of novelty, for a while, so they will crave it, and appreciate it, later. Hunger is the best spice. Friedrich Schiller, the poet and philosopher, always kept a carton of rotten apples under his desk when he wrote. He said it reminded him of the countryside. If you don’t have the possibility to sell yourself, to be known, you won’t be a genius. She says music, not classical music. This is no accident. Put the modifier classical or classic in front of a work - of music, of art, of anything - and you suck the life out of it. Inspiration is for amateurs. True creativity requires showing up at the desk, or the piano, even when you don’t feel like it. Vienna: No wonder Mozart and Beethoven and the rest thrived here. They had an entire city cheering for them. More than cheering. They egged on their musicians, prodding them, pushing them to ever greater heights. An audience, a good audience, is a sort of co-genius. They disapprove and the genius improves. We collect our dots in the company of others. We connect them by ourselves. The coffeehouse was not a “nice place.” Places of genius never are. Newcomers to a discipline are less committed to traditional rules and are particularly likely to see the rules no longer define a playable game and to conceive another set that can replace them. The past matters. We can’t innovate without building on the past, and we can’t build on the past unless we know it. Outside interests diffuse attention and allow problems to marinate. They exercise different mental muscles. Whenever he felt he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in his music. That would usually resolve all his difficulties. Einstein saw himself as an outcast. “I am truly a ‘lone traveler’ and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family with my whole heart.” Those words could just as easily have been written by Freud or Michelangelo or any number of other geniuses. Successful people “embrace failure.” Which is true. They do. Except it is also true that failures embrace failure. If anything, they embrace it more tightly. Successful failures are those people who remember exactly where and how they failed, so when they encounter the same problem again, even if in a different guise, they are able to retrieve these “failure indices” quickly and efficiently. When confronted with failure, “forget it and move on,” is dead wrong. “Remember it and move on” is the way of the genius. A schema violation is when our world is turned upside down. Temporal or spatial cues are off. Something is wrong. For instance, they would ask some participants to make breakfast in the “wrong” order. The ones engaged in a schema violation - subsequently demonstrated more “cognitive flexibility.” For creativity, watching people do weird things is nearly the same as doing those weird things ourselves. This explains why in a creative place such as Vienna breakthroughs in one field led to breakthroughs in entirely different fields. The very knowledge that there could be a new painting raised the likelihood of a new dance or poetry or politics. Schema violations explain how Freud was influenced by the cultural scene of Vienna even though he didn’t engage in it directly. Novelty was in the air. Genius begets more genius. New ideas such as Freud’s had a better shot at recognition in a city such as Vienna because, creativity is more likely in places where new ideas require less effort to be perceived. Places accustomed to new ideas, new ways of thinking, are more attuned to their arrival, and genius and the recognition of genius are inseparable. Geniuses and their cities; the fit is never perfect; there’s always an element of friction, of discord. Socrates loved Athens like a brother, and the city repaid him with a death sentence. Freud and Vienna were not always a happy fit, but they were a productive fit. They brought out the best in each other. As a Jew, he was an outsider from the beginning. So he was not so afraid to be an outsider with his ideas. He had nothing to lose. If you were an insider - say, a member of the ruling Hapsburg family - you’re not about to rock the boat. The life of a Jew in the Vienna of 1900: You were simultaneously an insider and an outsider, one of us and one of them, accepted and shunned. Able to see the world around them with fresh eyes; as insiders, they were able to propagate these fresh insights, to make the invisible visible. You pick up a book from a physicist in the 1890s, and it is written in a way that people can understand. They had to defend their theories to a wide audience. How different from today, I think, when an academic is considered successful when no one can understand a word he says. Two kinds of geniuses: unifiers and revolutionaries. Unifiers connect the dots. Revolutionaries create new dots. In the Vienna of 1900, everybody felt a break was in the air. And the break was everywhere. You see a break in music, and a break in physics. So people said, ‘What about my field? Maybe there is a break there, too?’ Whenever new, and often competing, schools of philosophy emerged, other completely unrelated fields also thrived. The break was in the air. Excessive ornamentation causes objects to go out of style and become obsolete. If genius always makes the world a little bit simpler, then ornamentation does the opposite. Tension is a necessary ingredient for a place of genius. Intelligence and creativity are only tangentially related, as are education and creativity. You can be a really stupid genius. Egg of Columbus. In the story, Columbus returned from his voyage to America a hero, but some in Spain remained unimpressed with his feat. “Anybody can sail across the ocean, just as you have done,” one critic said over dinner. “It is the simplest thing in the world.” Columbus replied by reaching for an egg and challenging the dinner guests to make it stand on end. When none could do it, Columbus took the egg and broke the shell slightly. It stood easily. “It is the simplest thing in the world,” he said. “Anybody can do it - after he has been shown how.” You don’t get any more optimistic than Silicon Valley. “Brutally optimistic” is how one local put it. Anywhere else in the country, he explains, your new idea is met with an avalanche of reasons why it won’t work; in Silicon Valley, it’s met with a challenge. Why don’t you do it? What are you waiting for? Brutal. Paradoxes are a welcome antidote to theories which explain everything all too neatly. The Strength of Weak Ties: What we think of as weak ties - acquaintances, coworkers, etc. - are actually incredibly powerful. Likewise, what we think of as strong ties - close friends, family - are actually weak. You are more likely to learn something new from a weak tie. Strong ties make us feel good, make us feel that we belong, but they also constrict our worldview. A group with strong ties is more likely to lapse into groupthink than one with weak ties. Isn’t it interesting, though, that these prophets of a placeless future (internet) all live in one place? (SF, California) The proliferation of digital technology has made place more, not less, relevant. How to come up with good ideas. It’s easy: You have a lot of ideas and throw away the bad ones. A little bit of money promotes creativity but too much squelches it.","What made Athens, Florence, Hangzhou, Vienna, Calcutta, and Silicon Valley such creative centers? Author goes to each to find out, and dives into the subject of creativity in general. He's such a great writer, so insightful, and finds so many great points of view from the people he interviews. See his other book here “Geography of Bliss”. Equally brilliant."
Fluent Forever,Gabriel Wyner,0385348118,7,"Three basic keys to language learning: 1. Learn pronunciation first 2. Don’t translate 3. Use spaced repetition systems This book is about many things: language, the human brain, the learning process, the essence of words. But when you get down to brass tacks, it’s about learning languages with flash cards. Singers learn the pronunciation of languages first because we need to sing in these languages long before we have the time to learn them. In the course of mastering the sounds of a language, our ears become attuned to those sounds, making vocabulary acquisition, listening comprehension, and speaking come much more quickly. While we’re at it, we pick up a snazzy, accurate accent. None of my flash cards has a word of English on them. Skip the English word and use an image instead. Flash cards for the pronunciation rules, added a bunch of pictures for the nouns and some verbs, learned the verb conjugations, and then built up to simple definitions of more abstract concepts. In my hour a day on the subway, I had learned three thousand words and grammar concepts. Upon my arrival, I was to sign a paper pledging to use German as my only form of communication for seven weeks. Without an immersion program, I suspect advanced French would take five to eight months, working for thirty to forty-five minutes per day on your own. Level 2 languages like Russian and Hebrew should be twice that, and level 3 languages like Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Korean should take four times as long as French. We learn better when we’re having fun. I spend thirty to sixty minutes a day playing on my smartphone or watching TV. I get a language out of it, I feel productive, and I have fun. What’s not to like? Let’s learn how to play. French Language Resources: http://fluent-forever.com/French Chinese (Mandarin) Language Resources: http://fluent-forever.com/Chinese Get a good grammar book now. Books designed for classrooms are often sparse on explanations, because they expect that the teacher will be able to handle any confusion. You’ll often have more luck with a self-study book. A frequency dictionary typically contains the most important five thousand words. Guidebooks with CDs devoted entirely to pronunciation are wonderful resources and well worth the purchase. Find two dictionaries: a traditional bilingual dictionary, and a monolingual dictionary which has actual definitions. Private tutors who are extremely affordable are at http://italki.com/ “A man’s real possession is his memory. In nothing else is he rich, in nothing else is he poor.” - Alexander Smith Five principles of memory: • Make memories more memorable • Maximize laziness • Don’t review; Recall • Wait, wait! Don’t tell me! • Rewrite the past “Any fact becomes important when it’s connected to another.“ - Umberto Eco, Foucault’s Pendulum Cookie is memorable because it contains so many connections. I can access cookie in a thousand different ways. I will remember cookies if I read about them, hear about them, see them, smell them, or taste them. The word is unforgettable. We need to make your mjöður just as unforgettable, and we will do it by adding four types of connections: structure, sound, concept, and personal connection. Students were willing to sit in dark rooms for five consecutive days, watching ten thousand images in a row. After the study, these students accurately identified 83 percent of the images. Our capacity for visual memory is extraordinary; Combinations of words and pictures work even better than pictures alone. You will remember a concept with a personal connection 50 percent more easily. Extra repetition is known as overlearning, and it doesn’t help long-term memory at all. Study a concept until you can repeat it once without looking and then stop. The amygdala tells the hippocampus what to keep and what to throw out. If we encounter emotionally arousing input, then the amygdala will strengthen that memory. A list of Spanish words will not give those memories much of a boost. At the moment where your performance is judged, your brain realizes that it had better get its act in gear. As a result, every memory you recall gets a squirt of memory-boosting chemicals. Our brains are designed to think and automatically hold on to what’s important. While running away from a tiger, we don’t think, “You need to remember this! Tigers are bad!” We simply run away, and our brain remembers for us. Memory tests are most effective when they’re challenging. The closer you get to forgetting a word, the more ingrained it will become when you finally remember it. Every act of recall imbues old memories with a trace of your present-day self. This trace gives those memories additional connections. Once you’ve rewritten these memories enough times, they become unforgettable. No one can give you a language; you have to take it for yourself. You are rewiring your own brain. To succeed, you need to actively participate. Each word in your language needs to become your word, each grammar rule your grammar rule. Minimal pairs: pairs of words that differ by only one sound. Like thinking and sinking, SUS-pect and sus-PECT, and niece and knees. These pairs get right to the heart of the hearing problem in a language, and practicing them with feedback provides the best way to train our ears and rewire our brains. Use minimal pair testing at the beginning of your language journey. Your brain is hardwired to ignore the differences between foreign sounds. To rewire it, listen to minimal pairs in your target language - similar sounding words like niece and knees - and test yourself until your brain adapts to hear these new sounds. “Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.” - Theodore Roosevelt The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA): Every IPA letter is not only a sound but also a set of instructions on how to make that sound. You only need three pieces of information to make any sound: you need to know what to do with your tongue, with your lips, and with your vocal cords, and there aren’t that many options. Your vocal cords go on and off. That’s it - it’s the only difference between “ssss” and “zzzz.” When you’re speaking vowels, your lips are basically rounded like “oo” or not. That’s all. The rest of the IPA focuses upon the location and behavior of your tongue. Load up the Wikipedia article for your language. Almost every consonant is a combination of three pieces of information: • Where’s your tongue? • What’s your tongue doing there? • Are your vocal cords doing anything? Vowels are a combination of two: • Where’s your tongue? • Are your lips in a circle? That’s it, for the most part. Say these: “bee fee thee see she ye key he”. Every successive word goes further back into your mouth. These are eight of the eleven possible locations for your tongue and lips. Say these: “toe no so low row”. They’re all at the same location (location S). For each word, you’re changing how and whether you allow air to pass around your tongue. T type (a sudden pop of air): Here you’re preventing air from passing through until you’ve built up so much pressure that the air pops through in a sudden rush T, d, p, b, k, and g N type (air through the nose): N and m are both in this group. S type: allowing a little bit of space for air to pass over your tongue from the rustling, hushing sounds of f, s, sh, h, and th as in thigh, to the buzzing sounds of v, z, and th as in thy. L type: You’re preventing air from escaping out the front, but you’re allowing it to pass freely over the sides of your tongue. We only have one in English: l. R type: not obstructing the flow of air at all, but you’re raising your tongue just enough to cause a change in the sound. r, w, and y, and they’re more like vowels than consonants (r is basically the ur in turkey, w is basically the oo in hoot, and y is basically the ee in see). Trilled type: Your tongue moves up to location S, but instead of allowing the air to hiss through, it flaps against the roof of your mouth. If, instead, you let your uvula flap against the back of your tongue, you’ll get the French r. Yay. The Spanish double r resides here (as in carro [car]). Tap type: Spanish r (as in caro): very similar to an extremely short d. when you say a vowel, but your tongue needs to be in a very precise position in order to sound right. Your tongue can go up, down, forward and back. Say “ee,” “eh,” “ah,” and you’ll feel your tongue move from high (“ee”) to medium (“eh”) to low (“ah”) in your mouth. Learn each new word with your fancy new accent. when we learn an accent, we are taking on the soul of that language. Ignore all the vocabulary and grammar in your book and jump to each pronunciation section. === How to Get Ridiculous Words into Your Mouth: Go backward. Say the end of the word, and then add one letter at a time until you can say the whole thing. Kids learn languages without first learning to read. Why can’t adults? We can, but kids learn languages by listening and watching adults for thousands of hours. The written word, on the other hand, is plentiful and free. Use a combination of recordings and a phonetic alphabet. Then stop with the recordings and rely on the phonetic alphabet. Phase out the phonetic alphabet once you're feeling (over)confident about your pronunciation. A phonetic alphabet helps you to see and hear whenever a sound rule shows up, and it gives you one more way to look at the same information. The more you can learn about something, the easier time you’ll have mastering it. The more you do, the less work it will be. (learning math:) They were trying to learn each piece in isolation - an extremely difficult proposition. It was so much easier if you could see how all the pieces interrelated. I didn’t have to memorize formulae; they were just examples of something much, much larger. By adding more pieces to learn, you’re making your job much easier. You’re learning faster, which means less work over time. I’m creating trainers: These trainers are cheaper than a pronunciation guidebook, and they should do a much better (and faster) job than the standard route. If you use these, you won’t need to make any flash cards now; just download them, install them, and within a few weeks, you’ll have pronunciation mastered. http://forvo.com/ Free, native-speaker recordings. Using Anki, put recordings from Forvo into your flash cards. http://rhinospike.com/ Free recordings of sentences My pronunciation youtube series http://fluent-forever.com/chapter3 http://italki.com/ can get you in touch with native speakers. You’re seventy-nine times more likely to talk about your mother than your niece. Why not learn mother first and niece later? Grammar books and language classes don’t follow this principle, in part because it’s easy to plan lessons around themes like “family”. You’ll learn words for apricots and peaches when your time would be much better spent learning about laptops, medicine, and energy. With only a thousand words, you’ll recognize nearly 75 percent of what you read. It’s easy to manage a sentence like “My dog chased a cat up a tree” when you already know dogs, cats, chasing, and trees. You’ll know the players and actions in your stories, and grammar will simply tell you who’s chasing whom. “We are never more fully alive, more completely ourselves, or more deeply engrossed in anything, than when we are at play.” - Charles Schaefer Use Small Dictionaries. A big dictionary might give you ten synonyms for “house.” You only need one right now. Lonely Planet Phrasebooks and glossaries at the end of grammar books are great resources, because they only contain the most basic words. The greatest illustrated book ever written: Google Images. You can search for some obscure word - aiguillage - and get 160,000 examples of the word in context. It’s an effectively unlimited source of tiny, illustrated stories about every word you need to learn. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page. There you’ll see the link Switch to Basic Version. Every image will now show up with its corresponding caption. Google Images will tell you a much more nuanced (and weird) story. Spend a few seconds looking for any memory about your word that comes to mind. To memorize the genders, imagine all of the masculine nouns exploding. Feminine nouns should catch fire. Neuter items should shatter like glass. Make your images as vivid as you can stomach. See how many of these images stick. We’re really good at remembering when those images are violent, sexual, funny, or any combination of the three. You’ll need two to three particularly vivid verbs. Do this automatically with every new word, and gender will cease being a problem from then on. Imagine each of your nouns performing that action. The key moments occur in the beginning, when you create those flash cards. In those moments, you’re taking new words and connecting them to as many images, thoughts, and memories as you can find. Flash cards are just a practical souvenir of that experience. Only use them to deepen memories you’ve already formed. Right from the beginning, your masculine nouns should be different from your feminine nouns, You can probably find a professional translation of the 625 words on my website. Go to http://fluent-forever.com/Appendix5 I like to use relatively violent verbs for noun genders; my nouns rarely survive shattering, exploding, melting, burning, or cracking. Sexual verbs are classic choices Go through the 625 list and separate the words into three categories: 1. Words you know 2. Words you kind of know 3. New words Skip all the words in category 1. For words in category 2, use the Refresher Track For words in category 3, follow the instructions in the Gallery as if you were a beginner. Break down the most complex of grammatical constructions into easy-to-learn pieces, and memorize those pieces using your SRS. The written language is, in fact, our first foreign language - a dialect of our native tongue. Every language has a particular developmental order, which children and second language learners alike will inevitably follow on their way to fluency. If we had Spanish-speaking adults talking to us for twelve to sixteen hours a day for six years, we would probably speak Spanish at least as well as your average Spanish-speaking six-year old. If we stop comparing kids with thousands of hours of language exposure to adults with hundreds of hours, we’ll see a surprising trend: on average, adults learn languages faster than kids do. Every sentence you understand brings you closer to fluency. Use your grammar book as a quick guided tour through your language. You’ll read the explanations, learn an example or two, and skip over the (often monotonous) drills and exercises. The examples you learn will help you remember each grammar rule, and they’ll serve as comprehensible input at the same time. Just pick out an example or two that you find particularly interesting, make a flash card for them, and poof, you’ll have that grammar rule memorized forever. Get an overview of the entire grammatical system of your new language. Find a good source of simple, clear sentences with translations and explanations. Take your first sentences out of your grammar book. That way, your sentences can do double duty, teaching you every grammar rule consciously while your language machine works in the background, piecing together an automatic, intuitive understanding of grammar that will rapidly bring you to fluency. Grammar is amazing in its simplicity. All of grammar’s infinite possibilities are the product of three basic operations: we add words (You like it Do you like it?), we change their forms (I eat I ate), and we change their order (This is nice Is this nice?). That’s it. To learn a new grammatical form, all you have to do is find an example from your grammar book, understand the gist of the story in that example, and ask yourself three questions: • Do you see any new words here? • Do you see any new word forms here? • Is the word order surprising to you? Then you’ll make flash cards for any information you’d like to learn: For functional words like of and what, these words don’t mean much outside of their contexts. Use an example sentence into I’d like a glass _____ water, which is a thousand times more useful than a clunky dictionary definition. While your grammar book is busy explaining the past tense of eat (She ate her sister’s birthday cake), you’re learning everything that sentence has to offer - where to put her, how sister turns into sister’s, and so on. This turns into a fun game - it’s like a race with your grammar book, to see whether you’ll completely master a topic before your grammar book even talks about it. First things first: there’s no need to memorize verb conjugation. The only input that can feed our language machines is comprehensible input. We need stories. Use that declension table to quickly generate a bunch of variations on whatever examples you find in your textbook. If you’ve already learned to use a verb like steal, you’re going to have a much easier time learning all three forms of a similar verb - choose/chose/chosen - all at once. You’re not really remembering sixty-five different verb forms at once; you’re just remembering that this verb follows the pattern of some other, more familiar verb. Create mnemonic images that meant “this verb follows the same pattern as teach / taught / had taught” Attach these images to every new word that follows an old pattern. Attach multiple mnemonic images to single words, images that can work with verbs and adjectives. The person-action-object (PAO) system, a person (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an action (explodes), and an object (a dog). If you want to learn the ten ways to make German plural nouns, for example, you can choose ten people to represent them. Make a couple of flash cards for each of your mnemonic images. Any time you run into a tricky pattern, choose a person, action, or object to help you remember. For verb patterns, pick a mnemonic person or an object. For noun patterns, use a person or an action. Adjectives fit well with objects, and adverbs fit well with actions. Write about whatever you want to learn. You don’t need to craft a perfect essay, and in fact, you’ll learn more if you write quickly and mess up a few times. Learn how a native speaker would express the same ideas on http://lang-8.com/ http://italki.com is one of the best Based upon your own writing and thoughts, so it’s much more memorable than anything you could find in a grammar book. Put every correction you receive into your flash cards. Rely upon a single skill: the ability to break a sentence down into tiny pieces. Use this skill over and over until you’ve mastered the grammar and vocabulary. Remember every tiny detail about every sentence you choose. Any time the position of a word, the form of a word, or the word itself surprises you, then learn it. But if you’re not surprised by it, then skip it and move on Any time you have a question - “How do I say x?” “Can I do y?” - just write out a few sentences, submit them for corrections, and get your answers. If you have absolutely no idea how to write something, use Google Translate (translate.google.com) to get yourself in the ballpark.19 Then submit your sentences for corrections and see what the native speakers say. Google Images can also produce illustrated examples for any grammatical construction. Need a good story for French’s avait fait (he / she / it had done)? Search for “avait fait” and you’ll find 1.6 million different examples of that construction Google Images is a wonderful (and fast) way to find good example sentences for your words. A good monolingual dictionary is an extraordinary source of input. Every time you read a new definition, you automatically learn a few new words and a bunch of grammar. A couple chapters back, we were avoiding synonyms. Now we can embrace them, because we can use dictionaries to tell us the differences between our policemen (formal) and our cops (informal). In the last chapter, I suggested that you skip any tricky words and learn them later. Now, with the help of a monolingual dictionary, there’s nothing you can’t learn. Most of the words we know are rarely, if ever, spoken aloud. When’s the last time you said “excavate”? There’s only one feasible source left: as it turns out, we learn the vast majority of our words through reading. Practically speaking, we’ll automatically learn an unknown word 10 percent of the time we encounter it. Read as much as you can, as quickly as possible. Find a familiar story - a translation of something you’ve already read or a book that’s been turned into a movie you’ve seen - and read it along with an audiobook. The audiobook will carry you along and help you read faster than you otherwise would. You won’t have the time to get bogged down with unknown words, and you’ll pick up the rhythm of the spoken language. It’s not always important to know whether a wizard’s wand is made of yew or alder; sometimes you just need to know what that wizard did. This is yet another skill that will serve you in the future; you need the ability to skip over holes in your vocabulary. Learn to let go of the words you don’t understand. If you want to understand real-world speech, watch movies and television. You can see precisely what they’re doing while they speak. These visual clues can help you understand what you’re hearing. Don’t use subtitles in English or your target language. when subtitles are present, we don’t improve at listening. TV series are easier than films. Choose your first shows very carefully by reading about those shows ahead of time on Wikipedia. Choose whatever you like, as long as it’s not comedy. 24 Heures Chrono (the French dub of 24) did wonders for my French. Video-chat with a native speaker: Verbling, Live Mocha, and italki. The real challenge is figuring out what to talk about once you’ve made your introductions. If you’re aiming for efficiency, then pull out a word frequency list and discuss every word you don’t know in order. Take notes on everything you learn. Middlebury College in Vermont: you speak exclusively in your target language for seven to eight weeks. Flash card reviews are only fun when you’re learning new things at the same time. So make sure you always have something new to learn - even just a couple of new words a day. Learning a language makes it harder to think. When you learn French, you effectively implant a little Frenchman in your head who never shuts up. You necessarily learn to muffle and ignore your native language. You learn to focus in the face of constant linguistic distraction, and as a result, your brain gets better at focusing in general. A foreign language can feel like a mask. It’s a game of make-believe. You’re playing the role of Some French Guy. You occasionally catch yourself saying things you never would have said in English. After all, it’s not really you; it’s just a game. But that’s not quite true. It is you. And you can only meet that side of yourself in a foreign language. You’re looking for the mysteries hidden beneath the surface of every word and grammar rule. What makes a word like gato different from cat? How can you use German grammar to think in a completely new way? Many simple cards are better than a few complex cards. Always ask for one correct answer at a time. You’ll want each word to bring out an explosion of associations: sounds, spellings, multiple definitions, grammatical features, memories, and emotions. You’ll build these associations fastest if you tackle them one flash card at a time. What’s a baby chèvre called? (a chevreau); What’s a chevreau turn into when it grows up? (a chèvre). Essential facts (you need to remember these!): • Picture: Can you remember what this word means? What’s it look like? • Pronunciation: Can you say this word out loud? You get a bonus point whenever you add a nonessential connection to a word. Any personal connections with this word? Any other (Hungarian) words that start with the same sound or spelling? Words that relate to this word in meaning? Pronunciation trainers save you an enormous amount of time, because they make the rest of your language much easier to remember. Get a trainer off of my website http://fluent-forever.com/chapter3 Once you can hear the differences between each of the sounds, focus on every new sound that doesn’t seem to agree with your tongue. This will take you three to eight days to learn at thirty minutes a day. Three chunks of information for each sound: What’s this sound? What is it like? How do I spell this sound? What’s an example word for this sound? You’ll need example words for every spelling/sound combination. Card Type 1: What does this spelling sound like? (e.g., ä as in German’s Lächeln [smile] sounds like [recording]/lɛçln) Card Type 2: How do you spell this example word? (e.g., [recording of Lächeln (smile)]/lɛçln is spelled L-ä-c-h-e-l-n) Bonus points if you can pronounce the whole word rather than just the sound in the middle of it Example Word: Can you think of any other word that uses this sound? Can you remember how it’s spelled, how it’s pronounced, or what it means? Use a recording of the entire example word (Lächeln) rather than the individual sound (“eh”). For Chinese, you should learn your sounds in Pinyin In Japanese, you should do this in Hiragana and Katakana Learn thirty flash cards a day. Once you’ve done this for a week or two, you’ll be ready to move on to vocabulary. Here’s how you’ll learn those 625 words: You’ll have 625–1875 cards, which will take you one to three months to learn with your SRS (or less time, if you review for more than thirty minutes a day). Connect four or five chunks of information for every word in your new language: Spelling Pronunciation Picture - the Spot the Differences Game: Personal Connection - the Memory Game: Gender - the Mnemonic Imagery Game Automate your web searches, so you can type in your word once and it automatically searches as many websites as you want at the same time. I usually search a bilingual dictionary, a monolingual dictionary, Google Images inside of Google Translate, and Forvo.com for each word, and it only takes a single mouse click. You can find a guide to setting this up (it only takes a few minutes) at http://fluent-forever.com/multi-search Form deep, multisensory experiences with each word you learn. (one to three minutes per word) Card Type 1: What’s this word mean? Card Type 2: What’s the word for this image? Card Type 3: How do you spell this word? Special Scenarios: Multiple definitions: You can either put the main definition on the back side, or you can put multiple definitions there (and if you remember any definition, then mark it as correct). You’ll tend to remember one definition best, which then becomes the anchor point for new definitions. (Chocolate bars use the same word as normal bars!) For your first 625 words, don’t learn synonyms. You don’t need them. If you encounter a few different translations for a word you want to know, pick your favorite and move on. You may learn one word - dish - and find that your grammar book uses a synonym - plate - instead. Make it with both words or with your favorite word. Remember that any correct answer (plate or dish) is correct; you don’t need to sit there and list synonyms for your pictures. Words with easily confounded images: add a personal note or you can add a German clue using words from your 625. Word for “border” under a picture of a beach to get “coastline.” Cards for Chapter 5: Play with sentences. You’ll learn how to use them to learn abstract words, to learn how words change in different contexts, and to learn the ways that word order affects meaning. And you’ll do it all without a trace of English. Like a portable language immersion program that you’ve built yourself. There are three main categories of cards here: new words, word forms, and word orders. As soon as you learn where to stick a verb in one sentence, you’ll get a feel for where it belongs in almost every vaguely similar sentence. You don’t need to learn anything twice. This puts you on a constant quest for new, surprising constructions to learn. http://TinyURL.com/basicimage (the images are smaller and easier to copy/paste). What are some good pictures for this sentence? Can you use a few different pictures to help you remember the meanings of each individual word? Figure out how many different things you can teach yourself with one sentence We’ll learn the word in. Card Type 1: Which word fits in the blank? (e.g., “He lives __ New York City” → in, pronounced in) Card Type 2: What’s a sentence/phrase that includes this word? (e.g., in → “He lives in New York City.”) Card Type 3: Which word fits into this other blank? (e.g., The Cat __ the Hat → in, pronounced in) Card Type 4: How do you spell this word? (e.g., Pronounced in, fits into “He lives __ New York City” → i-n) We’ll learn the word form lives. Card Type 1: Which word fits in the blank? “He __ in New York City” [to live] (e.g., lives, pronounced 1ivz) Card Type 2: What’s a sentence with the word lives? What’s the base word form? (e.g., “He lives in New York City.” [to live]) Card Type 3: Which word fits into this other blank? “No one __ forever” [to live]? (e.g., “No one lives forever.”) Card Type 4: How do you spell this word? (e.g., Pronounced 1ivz, fits into “He __ in New York City” → l-i-v-e-s) Word Order: We’ll learn where to put the word He. Card Type 1: Where do you put He in “Lives in New York City”? (e.g., “He lives in New York City.”) What do you do with a dialogue like this? Waiter: Here’s your coffee! Customer: Thank you. Waiter: You’re welcome. Turn a short phrase into several flash cards instead of two. Words like honest or fascinating - you need to learn how to add definitions. A good example sentence or two; a good, concise definition; and a picture. Look for an example sentence that includes a few words you know already and a few words you don’t. That way, you’ll pick up a few new words passively. Using Google Images to find example sentences, they already come with pictures. Expect to spend around two to three minutes per word. Card Type 4: How do you spell this word? (e.g., Pronounced anist, fits into “He was an __ man” → h-o-n-e-s-t) Your First 625: download both of these lists online at http://fluent-forever.com/appendix5 You don’t yet need him, her, his, their. How do you learn these without translations? Use pictures of people pointing at themselves/each other. Learn your language’s word for “verb” and add it to any verb that could masquerade as a noun (to kiss vs. a kiss).","Forget Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, and the rest. I really believe this is the best way to learn another language, by far. Using the most up-to-date techniques and insights, and a unique emphasis on getting the sounds correct first. It's not easy, but it's much more effective than any other program or guide. Highly recommended if you're serious, and ready to do it."
Geography of Time,Robert Levine,81014039,7,"To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. The psychology of time and the psychology of places. Places, like people, have their own personalities. Empirical tests of the raw material of popular stereotypes. The pace of life or movement of time that people experience is characterized by: - rhythms (what is the pattern of work time to down time? is there a regularity to social activities?) - sequences (is it work before play or the other way around?) - synchronies (to what extent are people and their activities attuned to one another?) People are prone to move faster in places with vital economies, a high degree of industrialization, larger populations, cooler climates, and a cultural orientation toward individualism. The healthier a place’s economy, the faster its tempo. Every technical advance is accompanied by a rise in expectations. People in bigger cities move faster Hotter places are slower. Slowest countries: Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia Fastest countries: Switzerland, Ireland, Germany Individualistic cultures, compared to collectivist ones, put more emphasis on achievement than on affiliation. The focus on achievement usually leads to a time-is-money mindset, which in turn results in an urgency to make every moment count. In cultures where social relationships take precedence, however, there is a more relaxed attitude toward time. The clock moves faster than people think it does. Videotape of a bank robbery: observers described the 30-second tape as having lasted for about 150 seconds. Extroverts are more accurate time estimators than are introverts. One of the primary tasks of Zen is learning to experience the here and now so utterly that time appears to stand still, to be “liberated from time.” They gave hypnotized college students the simple suggestion to “allow the present to expand and the past and future to become distanced and insignificant.” These instructions led to dramatically increased absorption in the present moment in people’s language, feelings, thought processes, and sensory awareness. Hypnotically induced time expansion may result in greater accomplishment per unit of real clock time. For the depressed person, however, the stretching of time is a chilling experience. The belief that there is no future, that the pain of the present is eternal, may lead to suicide. Time is experienced as shorter when people believe that they are making progress toward a goal. The greater the urgency, the more slowly time passes. No single temporal dimension tells us more about the psyche of a culture than knowing what its denizens think about activity and inactivity. - United States: keeping busy is generally considered a good thing, while doing nothing signals waste and void. Inactivity is dead time. Even leisure time in the United States is planned and eventful. - Brunei: people wake up in the morning asking, “What isn’t going to happen today?” - In Nepal and India: I have watched friends drop by one anothers’ homes, only to sit and remain silent. Simply sitting, they explained, was doing something. Now again we wait, facing each other silently. Balkan time. We sit, the way Zen masters sit. There’s no awkwardness in it, no frantic noddings of the head or reassuring smiles. I’m beginning to find it strangely relaxing. I’m shifting to another sense of events, in which you don’t insist on fulfilling a plan, but wait for what happens next. Japanese, for example, hold the concept of ma - roughly meaning the spaces or intervals between objects and activity - in the highest esteem. Westerners might refer to the space between a table and a chair as empty. The Japanese refer to the space as “full of nothing.” Chinese, for example, are said to be masters of waiting for the right moment. They believe that the wait itself is what creates that moment. How long is the wait? As long as it needs to be. A major factor in obesity is a tendency for eating to be governed by external cues from the surrounding environment. People of normal weight, he believed, are more responsive to their internal hunger pangs. “There’s no such thing as wasting time where I live. How can you waste time? If you’re not doing one thing, you’re doing something else. Even if you’re just talking to a friend, or sitting around, that’s what you’re doing.” The Nuers from the Sudan: They construct their fishing dams and cattle camps, for example, in the month of kur. How do they know when it is kur? It’s kur when they’re building their dams and camps. They break camp and return to their villages in the months of dwat. When is it dwat? When people are on the move. There’s an old joke about an American on a whirlwind tour of Europe who is asked where he is. “If it’s Tuesday,” he responds, “this must be Belgium.” If Nuers were asked the same question they might answer: “If it’s Belgium, this must be Tuesday.” The Andamanese have constructed a complex annual calendar built around the sequence of dominant smells of trees and flowers in their environment. When they want to check the time of year, the Andamanese simply smell the odors outside their door. Daybreak: “when there is light enough to see the veins in their hand.” Three English verbs “to expect,” “to hope,” and “to wait” all translate into the single Spanish verb “esperar.” Gulliver, who looked at his watch before doing anything. He called it his oracle. The Lilliputians he met in his travels decided that Gulliver’s watch must be his God. In other words, they thought he was crazy. The most fruitful approach of all is one that moves flexibly between the worlds of P-time and M-time, event time and clock time, as suits the situation. It is easy to confuse cultural normalcy with ethnocentric superiority. “Make ‘em laugh, make ’em cry, but above all, make ‘em wait.” - Bill Smethurst, soap opera producer The more important we are, the greater the demand for our time. Important people are usually seen by appointment only. While those of higher status are allowed to make people below them wait, the reverse is strictly prohibited. Brazilians rated people who are always late for appointments as most successful and punctual people as least successful. Brazilians rated a person who was always late for appointments as more relaxed, happy, and likeable. The value of financial consultants, attorneys, or performers is enhanced by the simple fact that they are booked well in advance. This leads to even greater demand for their time, and so the cycle continues. In a building: In a literal sense, the higher up you go, the longer the wait. Low down on the scale are the men you can walk right up to. They are usually behind a counter waiting to serve you. The French term “attendant” makes clear - was one who served the whims of his superior. Gathered in front of the building are people who will hire themselves out to stand in your place overnight. In Brazil, there are more highly trained professional waiters known as despachantes. These are para-professionals who serve as intermediaries between well-off citizens and the endless bureaucratic red tape. Siddhartha, who believed: “Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goal, if he can think, wait and fast.” Israelis at bus stops stubbornly resist forming distinct lines. But established implicit rules, so that commuters almost invariably boarded the bus in order of arrival. Italian queues are more likely to be characterized by lighthearted conversation and a general atmosphere of gaiety, as opposed to the irritability and impatience that typify American lines. Cultures that emphasize productivity and making money typically create a sense of time urgency and a value system that fosters individualistic thinking; and that time urgency and individualism in turn make for a productive economy. Japan’s special blend of collectivism focuses on devotion to the group. For most workers, by far the most important of these groups is their company. In Japan, these efforts are cast in dimensions of patriotism. Through sharing the suffering of the group - could the body reach that height of existence that the individual alone could never attain. “I feel toward my department as you feel toward your family.” Japanese workers’ hours are long, but their production is not as great as Westerners might expect. They spend a lot of time talking with colleagues, going to meetings, idly chatting. Their workday, in other words, is not just production-oriented. Even after a long day on the job, workers at Sapporo Medical University will often hang around for another couple of hours, perhaps drinking beer and watching a ball game with their co-workers. These habits help create the desired harmony in social relations. Extreme present-orientedness, not lack of income or wealth, is the principal cause of poverty. An elaborate set of timeteaching exercises they have designed to train children from third-world cultures to adapt to Israel’s mainstream pace of life. Preparing children to deal with ideas like time limitations, the value of time, and the desirability of efficiency, they are helping them to understand that in their new culture anyone who fails to master the clock may be labeled a failure. If you are moving in the opposite temporal direction, from fast to slow, there is as much or more to learn. Learn to translate appointment times. In the United States, the major unit of time for assessing punctuality for appointments is usually on the order of five minutes. When visiting traditional Arab cultures, however, you should know that the corresponding unit of time is fifteen minutes. If an Arab is thirty minutes late by your clock, he is only ten minutes late by his own standards. A Brazilian friend, he explained my error, one I was to repeat many times: how a “yes” often meant “no” and that it was more important to Brazilians to appear helpful and polite than to stand by their time commitments. My friend then scolded me for having backed my colleagues into a corner by making a request they could neither deny nor deliver on. Rejecting my request would have been both rude and an acknowledgment of their inefficacy. Missing an appointment is simply a severe case of lateness, a well-accepted Brazilian behavior. And in Brazil, people’s feelings are more important than accurate information. Study the rules of the waiting game. When you arrive in a foreign culture, be sure to inquire about the specifics of their version of the waiting game. Are their rules based on the principle that time is money? Who is expected to wait for whom, under what circumstances, and for how long? Are some players exempt from waiting? What is the protocol for waiting in line? Is there a procedure for buying oneself a place in front, or off the line completely? What social message is being sent when the accepted rules are broken? Learn to reinterpret “doing nothing.” Is appearing chronically busy a quality to be admired or to be pitied? Is doing nothing wasted time? Is constant activity seen as an even bigger waste of time? Is there even a word or concept for wasted time? Of nothing happening? Doing nothing? You may have the opportunity to discover how curiously relaxing it can be to sit together in silence, free from plans, simply waiting for what happens next. Ask about accepted sequences. Each culture sets rules about the sequence of events. Is it work before play, or vice versa? Is one expected to have coffee or tea and socialize before getting down to serious business, and if so, for how long? Isn’t it a bit ridiculous to make a lifelong arrangement based on an emotional reaction? The time it takes to move from out-group to in-group status. How long should you expect to be an outsider? A move from clock time to event time will require a complete shift of consciousness. Don’t criticize what you don’t understand. How one has to live in an Indian village: I would often get up in the morning and ride my bicycle five miles, say, to meet a particular farmer. Arriving there, it was usual to find out that he was away or expected back soon, which might well mean the next day. By the second year, this type of event had stopped feeling like a disappointment, because I no longer really expected to accomplish anything in the first place. In fact, it seemed almost humorous to think that you could truly accomplish what you had set out to accomplish. Instead, I would just go and sit in the local tea shop and meet some new people or simply stare at the animals, children, and other assorted passersby. Then, maybe, something else other than what I’d planned to do would happen. Or maybe it wouldn’t. Whatever work was going to get done would come to me. At least for Americans, the least happy people are those with no time pressure at all. Many situations are best met by a temporal approach requiring a rapid pace of life: speed, attention to the clock, a future orientation, the ability to value time as money. Other domains in life - rest, leisure, the incubation of ideas, social relationships - are more adequately met with a relaxed attitude toward time. People who are confined to rigid and narrow temporal bands are unprepared to determine their own futures and political fates. Multitemporality is the ticket out of these temporal ghettos. To have the ability to move quickly when the occasion demands it, to let go when the pressure stops. Is this something that I absolutely must do? Is it something that I choose to do? Unless there was a “yes” to one of these questions I would not invest my time Having arrived home, to cease the hard work of coping with constant change. (It is for good reason that the word “travel” is related to the French “travail,” meaning hard work.)",Interesting look at how different cultures consider time in different ways.
Show Your Work,Austin Kleon,076117897X,7,"Consistently post bits and pieces of your work, your ideas, and what you’re learning online. Instead of wasting your time “networking”, take advantage of the network. Many people waste time and energy trying to make connections instead of getting good at what they do, when being good at things is the only thing that earns you clout or connections. “Scenius”: great ideas are often birthed by a group of creative individuals - artists, curators, thinkers, theorists, and other tastemakers - who make up an “ecology of talent.” Being a valuable part of a scenius is not about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contribute - the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start. Stop asking what others can do for us, and start asking what we can do for others. The amateur - the enthusiast has the advantage over the professional. Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share the results. You can move from mediocre to good in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something. Authors of good nonfiction books pay far closer attention and think at far more length about all sorts of different stuff than most of us have a chance to in our daily lives. Regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it. Two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can. The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten. “I saw the Sex Pistols. They were terrible. . . . I wanted to get up and be terrible with them.” Raw enthusiasm is contagious. Learning in front of others. If your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. There’s the artwork, the finished piece, and there’s the art work, all the day-to-day stuff that goes on behind the scenes. Human beings are interested in other human beings and what other human beings do. People really do want to see how the sausage gets made. Scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting bit of media that you can share. Become a documentarian of what you do. Don’t show your lunch or your latte; show your work. Don’t share absolutely everything. Put something out there because you think it might be helpful or entertaining. Flow is the feed. Stock is the durable stuff. Maintain your flow while working on your stock in the background. Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do - sometimes even more than your own work. “Do what you do best and link to the rest.” - Jeff Jarvis Don’t share things you can’t properly credit. First, they went out to thrift stores, flea markets, and yard sales and bought a bunch of “insignificant” objects for an average of $1.25 an object. Then, they hired a bunch of writers, both famous and not-so-famous, to invent a story “that attributed significance” to each object. Finally, they listed each object on eBay, using the invented stories as the object’s description, and whatever they had originally paid for the object as the auction’s starting price. By the end of the experiment, they had sold $128.74 worth of trinkets for $3,612.51. Significant Objects: Joshua Glenn and Rob Walker The first act is the past, the second act is the present, and the third act is the future. The first act is where you’ve been - what you want, how you came to want it, and what you’ve done so far to get it. The second act is where you are now in your work and how you’ve worked hard and used up most of your resources. The third act is where you’re going, and how exactly the person you’re pitching can help you get there. If, after hanging out with someone you feel worn out and depleted, that person is a vampire. If, after hanging out with someone you still feel full of energy, that person is not a vampire. (You can apply it to jobs, hobbies, places, etc.) The most valuable skill he picked up in art school was learning how to take a punch. Compulsive avoidance of embarrassment is a form of suicide. At some point, you have to switch from saying “yes” a lot to saying “no” a lot. “The biggest problem of success is that the world conspires to stop you doing the thing that you do, because you are successful. I looked up and realised that I had become someone who professionally replied to email, and who wrote as a hobby.” - Neil Gaiman Joni Mitchell says that whatever she feels is the weak link in her last project gives her inspiration for the next. “The minute you stop wanting something you get it.” - Andy Warhol “Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough.” - Alain de Botton “The Internet is a copy machine.” - Kevin Kelly “We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies.” - Walt Disney",Short inspiring book about sharing your work online.

How to Learn a Foreign Language,Paul Pimsleur,1442369027,7,"Sounds, although invisible, have a substance and a character of their own. Accept as your objective to learn the sounds rather than their written representation. When there is a conflict, when a word does not look the way it sounds, it is the sound you must believe in and cling to. This man ended up with a list of words on the back of an envelope. The Greek was in his pocket, but not in his mind; he had a sword that would not draw. Like many people, this important executive lacked faith in the spoken word. He trusted only what he could see written down. Many people, even many teachers, fall prey to the fallacy that the written form of a language is the language itself. Know before starting exactly what you want to accomplish and why. Language has three distinct components: pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. No known language is composed of fewer sounds than Hawaiian, which has fifteen, or more than certain languages of the Caucasus, which have up to sixty. Learning grammar becomes easier after having mastered the first two languages. All languages have devices for conveying whether an action is presently going on (she is dancing) or is finished (she danced); for relating people and things to each other (Jack’s wife; our car); for replacing a noun (the woman) by a pronoun (she). Ingrid Bergman, who knew five languages, was asked which she preferred, she replied: “English for acting, Italian for romance, French for diplomacy, German for philosophy, and Swedish for secrecy, because so few people know it.” Richard Burton said, “Simple grammar and vocabulary: marked out the forms and words that I knew were absolutely necessary, and learnt them by heart by carrying them in my pocket and looking over them at spare moments during the day. I never worked for more than a quarter of an hour at a time, for after that the brain lost its freshness. After learning some three hundred words, easily done in a week, I stumbled through some easy workbook (one of the Gospels is the most come-atable), and underlined every word that I wished to recollect. Then chose some other book whose subject most interested me. The neck of the language was now broken, and progress was rapid. Whenever I conversed with anybody in a language that I was learning, I took the trouble to repeat their words inaudibly after them, and so to learn the trick of pronunciation.” It is fair to ask, at the end of a language lesson, be it the first or the fiftieth, “What did I learn today that would help me if I left immediately for the foreign country?” One way to judge a teacher is to calculate the ratio of teacher-talk to student-talk. With a good teacher, it will be heavily in favor of student-talk. No more than five minutes of a class ought to be spent talking English - just enough to get a tough grammar point across. Grammar is best learned by using it, not by talking about it. There is not a single point of grammar in an elementary course that cannot be explained in four minutes or less. The music of a language, its intonation, strikes you even when you cannot comprehend a single word. It can also be the first thing you learn. Absorb the new accent by listening to someone speak the language and imitating the sounds he makes. Imitate the way the foreign person speaks English. A foreign accent is merely the transfer of speech habits from one language to another. If you will trust your ear, you are almost certain to speak with a good accent. The teacher’s function is to set day-to-day goals, encouraging his students to concentrate, not on the distant objective of total fluency, but on taking one more step. Break the language down into manageable tasks. Think Sounds, Not Letters: Probably the biggest impediment to good pronunciation is picturing how a word is written while saying it. These English sounds rise automatically to our lips instead of the foreign ones, and we must spend part of our energy in combatting this tendency. Never Look at the Letter R: In English, r is pronounced differently from other languages. Our tongues curl up more than for a Spanish or Italian r, and in quite the opposite direction from a French or German r. Looking at the written word while saying it makes the tongue instinctively take the English r position and thereby makes learning the foreign sound more difficult. The correct learning sequence is this: listen carefully to get the sound firmly planted in your ear; then gradually imitate it with your tongue. Do not use your eye till you have the pronunciation down pat. Work with a Model: Check your pronunciation often until good speech habits are firmly established. Practice sounds in a specific setting. The French r, reputedly a very difficult sound, is easier to pronounce in the word Paris than in rouge, and needs to be practiced in both. Think in Sound-Clusters. J’en ai un (“I’ve got one”). You might say each word authentically and yet be unable to glide them together with a native-like accent. One must practice the glide as well as the sounds. Practice Whole Phrases, Not Words: In real life, a string of words like “I don’t know” or “Not on your life” is said as though it were a single word. If you stop to take a breath in the middle of a foreign phrase that should be said in a single burst, you are not saying it correctly. For mastering a really difficult foreign sound. I keep careful track of when my friends thought I was closer and when they thought I was further away from the correct pronunciation. Listen very intently, trying to discover what gives it its distinctive quality. Good pronunciation begins not in the mouth but in the ear. Invite a Friend to Make Fun of You: When you have trouble hearing the difference, ask an acquaintance to imitate your pronunciation followed by the right one. Don’t try saying it yourself prematurely; you risk becoming discouraged easily at this point. Keep listening until you feel the difference penetrating you. One class learned French grammar by the rules while another learned it by listening to recordings. Students who worked with recordings acquired grammatical habits with unexpected ease. The ear may find simple what the mind calls complicated. Students who had spent only sixty minutes practicing in the lab did slightly better than those who had spent more than a week on it in class. The reason for their advantage is simple. They had heard and said a large number of correct French sentences, and their ears had become so attuned that only a correct sentence “sounded right” to them. The best arrangement of material for learning, is: (1) pose a challenge (2) let the students try to respond (3) provide the correct response Novelty rather than repetition should become the primary law of learning.” More than 50 percent of the grammar exercises in an elementary language course deal with just two features of grammar: pronouns and verbs. Virtually any question one can ask will bring about the use of a pronoun or two in the answer. Q: Hasn’t Mrs. Dexter lost a lot of weight lately? A: Yes, she has. Q: Didn’t your father lend his gold watch to the man next door? A: Yes, he did lend it to him. Make up cues that will force you to use pronouns in the answer. Forget the old classroom bugaboo about answering in “complete sentences” and give natural answers instead. Verbs are the only words in most languages that can assume many forms. In French, for example, a noun can have only two forms (singular and plural), and an adjective only four (masculine singular and plural, feminine singular and plural). But a verb...! I once counted the different written forms a French verb can take and was amazed to find over 130! A dozen or so common verbs (be, do, go, etc.) account for a very high percentage of all verb occurrences. These few are almost all “irregular,” for, being on people’s tongues more often, they have evolved and changed form faster: to be to have to be able to come to go to know to take to want to say or tell to do or make to see to give Make it one of your earliest jobs to find out how the language you are studying expresses these concepts. Learn the Hardest Thing First: it appears to fly directly in the face of reason. Yet it has helped me more than almost any other. Learn the hardest thing first and the rest will then seem easy. The sentence with several pronouns (“She gave it to him”) is as easy to learn as a sentence with only one pronoun. A sentence with two adverbs (“The horse ran exceptionally fast”) Attack the hardest features at the beginning of each lesson, when one is most receptive. The emotion surrounding a word helps impress it on our memories. During her stay in the hospital, she found herself learning vocabulary with an ease born of desperation. No need to say them over and over; their emotional impact made them stick in her mind after a single hearing. Inject a note of urgency into your attitude as you learn vocabulary. Some things should be learned in random order. Because that is how we encounter them in life. It is better to write a whole phrase on the flash cards than a single word. If you wish to learn a grammatical expression - let’s say jusqu’à (until) - put it down on a flash card in a sentence like Il est resté jusqu’au matin (He stayed until morning). The more striking or entertaining your sentence is, the better you are apt to recall it. You do not want to pair up French words with English words lest you be able to recall la nuit only when thinking “night.” Rather, you want la nuit to occur to you when you are “thinking in French,” without having to go through English to remember it. For la nuit, you might make three cards, reading: English Side French Side I never go out at night. Je ne sors jamais la nuit. Good night. Bonne nuit. I slept badly last night. J’ai mal dormi cette nuit. Once you can deliver the French sentence in response to these three different stimuli, you “know” la nuit in a much richer sense than if you could say it only in response to the English word “night.” One of the quickest and surest ways to pick up foreign vocabulary is through reading. An acquaintance was studying Tagalog in preparation for a trip to the Philippines. I advised him to play the role of a Filipino to the hilt during his lesson by using Filipino gestures and expressions as well as words. Letting yourself play the role will improve your performance. When a strange reaction follows something you have said, always track down the reason. Never let a chance go by to correct a wrong habit.","Short, punchy, incredibly insightful and useful book about learning another language, especially for a first-timer. I've read a few books on the subject now, but this is the only one that spoke directly to my issues. Especially loved his points on the importance of sounds over words. Hint: a language that is written but not spoken is called a dead language."
Man's Search for Meaning,Viktor Frankl,080701429X,7,"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How. Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or a quest for power, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Three possible sources for meaning: - in work (doing something significant) - in love (caring for another person) - in courage during difficult times You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you. Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. A man’s suffering is similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative. Every hour offered the opportunity to make a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance. It's tempting to look into the past to help make the present less real. But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. I became disgusted with the state of affairs which compelled me, daily and hourly, to think of only such trivial things. I forced my thoughts to turn to another subject. Suddenly I saw myself standing on the platform of a well-lit, warm and pleasant lecture room. In front of me sat an attentive audience on comfortable upholstered seats. I was giving a lecture on the psychology of the concentration camp! All that oppressed me at that moment became objective, seen and described from the remote viewpoint of science. By this method I succeeded somehow in rising above the situation, above the sufferings of the moment, and I observed them as if they were already of the past. Both I and my troubles became the object of an interesting psychoscientific study undertaken by myself. Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. Tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer. Every situation is distinguished by its uniqueness, and there is always only one right answer to the problem posed by the situation at hand. It doesn't matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you. No one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them. I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my “defense mechanisms,” nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my “reaction formations.” Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values! A high-ranking American diplomat was in psychoanalytic treatment which he had begun five years previously with an analyst in New York. At the outset I asked him why he thought he should be analyzed, why his analysis had been started in the first place. It turned out that the patient was discontented with his career and found it most difficult to comply with American foreign policy. His analyst, however, had told him again and again that he should try to reconcile himself with his father; because the government of the U.S. as well as his superiors were “nothing but” father images and, consequently, his dissatisfaction with his job was due to the hatred he unconsciously harbored toward his father. Through an analysis lasting five years, the patient had been prompted more and more to accept his analyst’s interpretations until he finally was unable to see the forest of reality for the trees of symbols and images. After a few interviews, it was clear that his will to meaning was frustrated by his vocation, and he actually longed to be engaged in some other kind of work. As there was no reason for not giving up his profession and embarking on a different one, he did so, with most gratifying results. He has remained contented in this new occupation for over five years, as he recently reported. I doubt that, in this case, I was dealing with a neurotic condition at all, and that is why I thought that he did not need any psychotherapy, nor even logotherapy, for the simple reason that he was not actually a patient. Not every conflict is necessarily neurotic; some amount of conflict is normal and healthy. Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts. Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: “Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?” Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now. Imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self-transcendence. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true. A forced intention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes. One is commanded and ordered to “be happy.” But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to “be happy.” If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke. In no way is it possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself, to laugh.","Powerful, deep, etc. First half describes life inside Auschwitz. Second half has powerful succinctly-said insights into the universal struggle. There's a reason this book has sold a billion copies."
Choose Yourself!,James Altucher,1490313370,7,"I have to count the things that are abundant in my life. Literally count them. If I don’t they will begin to disappear. Instead of counting sheep to get back to sleep, count all the things you are grateful for. “The American Dream” comes from a marketing campaign developed by Fannie Mae to convince Americans to start taking mortgages. I never blame anyone but myself. Every second I am manipulated and coerced and beaten down it’s because I’ve allowed it. When I say “everybody”, what I really mean is “me”. I don’t know anything about everybody. I only know what happened to me. Be a creator, an innovator, an artist, an investor, a marketer, and an entrepreneur. Now you have to be all of the above. Build the house where your freedom resides. Time heals all wounds. But we can control how much time it takes. When I get on a subway, I like to find a seat and read and daydream until I arrive at my destination. Who doesn’t? When asked, “Can I have your seat?” 70% of the people gave up their seats. But the interesting thing is how reluctant the students were to even do the experiment. It points out how hard it is for us to do things for ourselves unless we are given some implicit permission. Success comes from continually expanding your frontiers in every direction—creatively, financially, spiritually, and physically. Always ask yourself, what can I improve? Who else can I talk to? Where else can I look? “All I want is freedom,” a lot of people say. But freedom from what? Who is enslaving you that you can’t get away from? Every time you say yes to something you don’t want to do, another small percentage of your life will be used up. All you need to do to live longer is to constantly make sure you are doing everything you can to protect your heart and the blood that flows through it. Come up with ten ideas a day. Write down a list of ideas. The ideas can be about anything. The past and future don’t exist. They are memories and speculation. “How can I disappear,” is sort of like saying “How can I kill this life I have and start another”. Sleep eight hours. Eat two meals instead of three. Say to yourself “I’m going to save a life today.” Take up a hobby that takes you out of your current rhythm. Forgive someone. Don’t have sex with someone you don’t love. No dinner if you can avoid it (eat a late lunch and a late breakfast.) when I was twenty-seven, I had yet to start a business, yet to ever fall in love, yet to write a book, yet to make a TV pilot, yet to fail at twenty businesses in a row, yet to run a hedge fund, VC fund. Most important, I had yet to fail. A minimalist lifestyle is bullshit unless you can do it across every sheath in the daily practice: not just physical, but also emotional, mental, and spiritual. Give up on the ambitions for the future that are more trouble and anxiety than they are worth. De-clutter your brain. To suffer a “little death” or to be “born again.” After starting up several businesses, I can tell you this: I have never made one dime by traveling. And yet, I’ve traveled to most continents for business, cross country many times, meetings all over the place. No money from any of them. If someone asks me to go someplace, have a meeting, have a coffee, get on a call, etc., my first instinct is to say no. Being an entrepreneur means you’re going to create something in a way that a customer can’t get anywhere else. Creation is art. Silence is the only place your creative ideas will come from. Only hire someone you wouldn’t mind sitting next to on a plane ride across the country. If you are being exploited, learn how to exploit back. Everyone is an entrepreneur. The only skills you need to be an entrepreneur are the ability to fail, to have ideas, to sell those ideas, to execute on them, and to be persistent so even as you fail you learn and move onto the next adventure. The moment I wake up, I ask the darkness when I open my eyes, “Who can I help today? Who would you have me help today?” I’m a secret agent and I’m waiting for my mission. People with an idea ask me, “Should I raise VC money yet?” NO, of course not! First you have to hustle. Pick a boring business. Everyone is always on the lookout for “the next big thing.” Just do the old, old thing slightly better than everyone else. Build trust while you sleep. Honesty compounds over years and decades. More people trust your word and spread the news that you are a person to be sought out, sought after, given opportunity, given help, or given money. Make a service business on whatever the cutting edge of the Internet is. Start with small businesses. In the ’90s, you would’ve made a website business. Right now you can build an app or make a social media agency. Don’t just set up Facebook fan pages for people. Get those people some fans. Set people up on twitter. Then get those people followers. Once you have a few hundred thousand in revenues and you start hiring people, sell the business for $1 million. That’s it. There will be plenty of buyers (local ad agencies, bigger ad agencies trying to consolidate, bigger social media firms, small public companies trying to break into the ad space). Businesses called “roll-ups,” whose entire business is buying other businesses. These companies buy many mom-and-pop operations in different regions, combine them together, fire all of the back-office staff that are redundant, and now they are a national business with greater margins that can go public or get acquired. You’re always selling: selling your services, selling your customers’ services (!) (this is the real, true secret for keeping customers by the way), and selling your company. A rent-to-own laptop product. He bulk buys the laptops for $200 apiece and rents-to-own them out for $20 a week for a year. To get out of the rut he was in: There’s a saying, “It’s your best thinking that got you here.” So the first step is to literally throw away your “best thinking.” The way you get good ideas is to do two things: 1) Read two hours a day 2) Write ten ideas a day By the end of a year, you will have read for almost one thousand hours and written down 3,600 ideas. Sara had never done anything in fashion before. So she spent every day at the library and the hosiery stores. She had a full-time job but at night she researched every patent. She bought every type of panty hose. She knew the entire industry. To succeed at something: Know every product in the industry Know every patent Try out all the products Understand how the products are made Make a product that YOU would use every single day. You can’t sell it if you personally don’t LOVE it When I was building a trading business, I must’ve read more than two hundred books on trading and talked to another two hundred traders. I felt like I knew more about trading and the top investors out there than anyone else in the world. When I was building websites, I knew everything about programming for the web. There was nothing I couldn’t do. And the competition, usually run by businessmen and not programmers, knew that about me. STEPHEN KING: All it took was a few weeks out of action to throw him completely off his game. An accident he once had that prevented him from writing for several weeks. When he started to write again he could feel the difference. He said how the words just weren’t connecting right. The idea muscle must be exercised every day. To become an idea machine takes about six to twelve months of daily practice. An idea is too big if you can’t think of the next step. Richard Branson: When Virgin Records was making him a tidy profit of about $15 million a year, he decided there should be a more comfortable transatlantic airline. What the hell did he know about making an airline? Nothing. Note the important thing: the day he came up with the idea, he also called Boeing and got a plane from them. Not only did he identify the next step, but he took it. Every day, read/skim chapters from books on at least four different topics. This morning I read from a biography of Mick Jagger; I read a chapter from Regenesis, a book on advances in genetic engineering, a topic I know nothing about. I read a chapter in Tiny Beautiful Things by Cheryl Strayed. Write down ten ideas. About anything. It doesn’t matter if they are business ideas, book ideas, ideas for surprising your spouse in bed, ideas for what you should do if you are arrested for shoplifting, ideas for how to make a better tennis racquet, anything you want. The key is that it has to be ten or more. List ten ideas that are “too big for me” and what the next steps might be. Ideas mate with other ideas to produce idea children. Read other ideas. Compare your new ideas with your old ideas. The best ideas come from collisions between newer and older ideas. I have a very strict routine every day. I wake up, read, write, exercise, eat, attend meetings (phone or live), then reverse the process: eat, write, read, and sleep. when struggling for idea topics, search Twitter for phrases like: “I wish I had” “I just paid someone to” “is the worst product” “is a horrible company” “has a terrible website” “is my favorite website” “does anyone know how” Companies that use Groupons are struggling for customers and need creative ideas. Come up with other ways to promote the company or make their product better. Go to YouTube and put in a word relating to something you know nothing about Nobody is ever going to change their mind. For instance, if I say something like “kids shouldn’t go to college,” everyone either already agrees with me or disagrees with me. Very few minds will be changed. Every time I have a judgment about something, I change the punctuation at the end of the judgment from an exclamation point to a question mark. Walk around bewildered all day. It’s much more peaceful. “That guy shouldn’t shove me!” becomes “That guy shouldn’t shove me?” Oxytocin-rich meal: eggs, mixed with bananas and pepper. Procrastination is your body telling you that you need to back off a bit and think more about what you are doing. It could also mean you are doing work that is not your forte and that you are better off delegating. I find that many entrepreneurs are trying to do everything when it would be cheaper and more time-efficient to delegate, An entrepreneur learns two things from failure: First he learns directly how to overcome that particular failure. He’s highly motivated to not repeat the same mistakes. Second, he learns how to deal with the psychology of failure. Many people network too much. It’s tough to make money. It's not a party. If you think back to all of your best moments in life, were they moments when there were tons of thoughts happening in your head? Or moments when there were fewer thoughts, i.e., when you were calm and contemplative? I lose at least 20 percent of my intelligence when I am resentful. Maybe 30 percent if I throw feelings of revenge on top of it. Brene Brown has written an excellent book called The Gift of Imperfection. If you are the source of ideas, then you are ALWAYS the source. Every day think of at least two people to introduce to each other who will help each other. Pick your social media outlet, master it. “Why did you want me to wait two weeks to bring back my son?” Gandhi said, “Because before I could tell your son to stop eating sugar, I had to stop eating sugar first.” I don’t give any advice on things I don’t know about firsthand. Twitter Q&As (held every Thursday between 3:30 and 4:30 p.m. Eastern), Woody Allen: “If you work only three to five hours a day you become very productive. It’s the steadiness of it that counts. Getting to the typewriter every day is what makes productivity.” And he doesn’t waste time with distractions (going to parties, staying out late). Do you know where Allen was sitting when he won an Oscar for Annie Hall? In Michael’s Pub in Manhattan, playing his weekly jazz clarinet gig. Why get on a plane (eight hours, door to door), and go to a party where he would feel uncomfortable, to win an award he probably didn’t care much about. Then he went home, and took the phone off the hook. Avoid outside stimulus. “How do you get past this?” Diversification is everything. You get past “this” by having lots of “that”s.","Anyone who likes my writing will probably LOVE his writing. We've got a very similar style and approach. I was smiling most of the way through, reading things I could have (and wish I would have) written myself. His vulnerability is so endearing."
Self Reliance,Ralph Waldo Emerson,1936719061,7,"To believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men — that is genius. Moses, Plato and Milton spoke not what men thought, but what they thought. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts. Great works of art teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression, else tomorrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another. A boy never encumbers himself about consequences, about interests. He gives an independent, genuine verdict. But the man is clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has spoken he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account. He would utter opinions on all passing affairs. These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Man must be a nonconformist, and must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? How easily we capitulate to large societies and dead institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects me more than is right. There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I will go to prison if need be, but not for your miscellaneous popular charities. What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion. It is easy in solitude to live after our own. But the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. Do your work, and I shall know you. When I hear a preacher announce his topic, do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? He is pledged to look at one side, not as a man, but as a parish minister. These airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation. Character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza. Read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man. He who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of spirits. In nature, power is the essential measure of right. Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. All men have my blood and I have all men's. Your isolation must be elevation. At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles. But keep thy state; come not into their confusion. The power men possess to annoy me I give them by a weak curiosity. No man can come near me but through my act. Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other. For every thing that is given something is taken. Society acquires new arts and loses old instincts. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.","Pow! This punched me in the gut from page one. Takes a tiny effort to read the English of the 1840s, but what a reward. A masterpiece essay (manifesto?) on independence, non-conformity, and trusting oneself."
How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big,Scott Adams,1591846919,7,"Goals are for losers. Your mind isn’t magic. It’s a moist computer you can program. The most important metric to track is your personal energy. Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success. Happiness is health plus freedom. Luck can be managed, sort of. Conquer shyness by being a huge phony (in a good way). Fitness is the lever that moves the world. Simplicity transforms ordinary into amazing. When tackling any new and complicated problem, one step you will always do first: ask a smart friend how he or she tackled the same problem. Some companies take the goal of profits too far. But that is the risk of any tool. A hammer is good only if you stop pounding after the nail is all the way in. Keep pounding and you break the wood. You can cure your loneliness only by doing the talking yourself and - most important - being heard. When you stand in front of an audience, your sensation of time is distorted. That’s why inexperienced presenters speak too rapidly. Failure always brings something valuable with it. I don’t let it leave until I extract that value. Never make a loan to someone who is following his passion. He’s in business for the wrong reason. The best loan customer is one who has no passion whatsoever, just a desire to work hard at something that looks good on a spreadsheet. It’s easy to be passionate about things that are working out, but they drain your passion as they fail. In hindsight, it looks as if the projects I was most passionate about were also the ones that worked. But objectively, my passion level moved with my success. Success caused passion more than passion caused success. Have a system instead of a goal. Systems-driven people have found a way to look at the familiar in new and more useful ways. Running a marathon in under four hours is a goal, but exercising daily is a system. **** → A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal. Buying lottery tickets is not a system no matter how regularly you do it. Sell a service that almost always auto-renews. The world offers so many alternatives that you need a quick filter to eliminate some options and pay attention to others. Whatever your plan, focus is always important. If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it. It sounds trivial and obvious, but if you unpack the idea it has extraordinary power. Success has a price, but the price is negotiable. If you pick the right system, the price will be a lot nearer what you’re willing to pay. If you learn to appreciate the power of systems over goals, it might lower the price of success just enough to make it worth a go. When it comes to generosity, there are three kinds of people in the world: 1. Selfish 2. Stupid 3. Burden on others That’s the entire list. Your best option is to be selfish, because being stupid or a burden on society won’t help anyone. Society hopes you will handle your selfishness with some grace and compassion. If you do selfishness right, you automatically become a net benefit to society. Successful people generally don’t burden the world. Corporate raiders, overpaid CEOs, and tyrannical dictators are the exceptions. The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends. If you neglect your health or your career, you slip into the second category - stupid - which is a short slide to becoming a burden on society. Generous people take care of their own needs first. In fact, doing so is a moral necessity. The world needs you at your best. Being selfish doesn’t mean being a sociopath. It just means you take the long view of things. Once all of my personal needs were met, my thoughts automatically turned to how I could make the world a better place. Apparently humans are wired to take care of their own needs first, then family, tribe, country, and the world. Approach the problem of multiple priorities is by focusing on just one main metric: your energy. I make choices that maximize my personal energy because that makes it easier to manage all of the other priorities. Maximizing my personal energy means eating right, exercising, avoiding unnecessary stress, getting enough sleep. But it also means having something in my life that makes me excited to wake up. Blogging charges me up. It gets me going. I don’t need another reason. Manage your personal energy for the long term and the big picture. Having one more cocktail at midnight might be an energy boost at the time, but you pay for it double the next day. As I write this paragraph, my wife and our good friends are wondering why I’m selfishly lagging behind. But everyone will appreciate that I’m in a better mood when I show up. You can accomplish more by the time other people wake up than most people accomplish all day. Optimizing is often the strategy of people who have specific goals and feel the need to do everything in their power to achieve them. Simplifying is generally the strategy of people who view the world in terms of systems. The best systems are simple, and for good reason. Simple systems are probably the best way to achieve success. Once you have success, optimizing begins to have more value. Successful people and successful businesses have the luxury of being able to optimize toward perfection over time. Start-ups often do better by slapping together something that is 80 percent good and seeing how the public responds. There’s time to improve things later if the market cares about the product. Another big advantage of simplification is that it frees up time, and time is one of your most valuable resources in the world. When you are trying to decide between optimizing and simplifying, think of your entire day, not the handful of tasks in question. In other words, maximize your personal energy, not the number of tasks. Chip away at the complexity of your life over time. Simplicity is a worthy long-term goal. That’s how you will free your personal energy so you can concentrate it where you need it. Dedicate certain sitting positions and certain work spaces to work and other spaces to relaxation. To change how you feel, and how you think, you can simply change where you are sitting. One of the biggest obstacles to success - and a real energy killer - is the fear that you don’t know how to do the stuff that your ideal career plans would require. Success at anything has a spillover effect on other things. Becoming good at things that require nothing but practice. Once you become good at a few unimportant things, the habit of success stays with you on more important quests. When you’ve tasted success, you want more. And the wanting gives you the sort of energy that is critical to success. My so-called talent was little more than the result of insane hours of practice. Writing a book is hard. The way I motivate myself to take on a task this large is by imagining that I have fascinating and useful things to say that will help people. I choose to imagine that the book will do well because that illusion is highly motivating. It increases my energy. What were my odds of being the first person on earth to beat a focal dystonia? One in a million? One in ten million? I didn’t care. That one person was going to be me. Thanks to my odd life experiences, and odder genes, I’m wired to think things will work out well for me no matter how unlikely it might seem. Things that will someday work out well start out well. Things that will never work start out bad and stay that way. Watch what customers do about your idea or product, not what they say. People tend to say what they think you want to hear. What people do is far more honest. If the first commercial version of your work excites no one to action, it’s time to move on to something different. Don’t be fooled by the opinions of friends and family. If your work inspires some excitement and some action from customers, get ready to chew through some walls. You might have something worth fighting for. If you’re not a natural “practicer,” don’t waste time pursuing a strategy that requires it. You’re not doomed to mediocrity. You simply need to pick a life strategy that rewards novelty seeking more than mindless repetition. Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success. You can raise your market value by being merely good - not extraordinary - at more than one skill. Sometimes an entirely inaccurate formula is a handy way to move you in the right direction if it offers the benefit of simplicity. Ask yourself if there are any words in your first draft that you would be willing to remove for one hundred dollars each. If I told you that taking a class in Web site design during your evenings might double your odds of career success, the thought would increase the odds that you would act. If instead I only offered you a vague opinion that acquiring new skills is beneficial, you wouldn’t feel particularly motivated. When you accept without necessarily believing that each new skill doubles your odds of success, you effectively hack (trick) your brain to be more proactive in your pursuit of success. Looking at the familiar in new ways can change your behavior even when the new point of view focuses on the imaginary. Another huge advantage of learning as much as you can in different fields is that the more concepts you understand, the easier it is to learn new ones. “If you play a slot machine long enough, eventually you will...” The class yelled out in unison “WIN!” As most adults know, that is exactly the wrong answer. Slot machines are engineered to make everyone but the casino a loser in the long run. They confused the benefits of persistence with the actual odds of succeeding. While we all think we know the odds in life, there’s a good chance you have some blind spots. Finding those blind spots is a big deal. See the world as math and not magic. To increase your odds of success, systematically become good, but not amazing, at the types of skills that work well together and are highly useful for just about any job. * Public speaking * Psychology * Business writing * Accounting * Design (the basics) * Conversation * Overcoming shyness * Second language * Golf * Proper grammar * Persuasion * Technology (hobby level) * Proper voice technique Children are accustomed to a continual stream of criticisms and praise, but adults can go weeks without a compliment while enduring criticism both at work and at home. Adults are starved for a kind word. Knowledge is power. But knowledge of psychology is the purest form of that power. If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational. Brains are wired to better understand concepts that are presented in a certain order. For example, your brain processes “The boy hit the ball” more easily than “The ball was hit by the boy.” In editors’ jargon, the first sentence is direct writing and the second is passive. It’s a tiny difference, but over the course of an entire document, passive writing adds up and causes reader fatigue. Unnecessary words and passive writing kill the timing of humor the same way they kill the persuasiveness of your point. Be able to create your own cash-flow projection on a spreadsheet and feel some confidence that you understand the tax impacts and the so-called time value of money. There’s a tiny restaurant that has changed hands several times. They can’t work because there aren’t enough tables in the place to cover their expenses. One need not have an “eye” for design; knowing the rules is good enough. ### STORY: As a writer, I reflexively translate whatever I observe into a story form with a setup, a twist if there is one, and some sort of punch line or thought that ties it in a bow. Turn your interesting experiences into story form. brief? save the surprise for just the right moment? end the story with a punch line or interesting observation? The most important key to good storytelling is preparation. Story setup: Keep it really brief, as in “So, I took my car in for a brake job...” That’s it. Don’t tell us the problem with the brakes. Establish a pattern that your story will violate. Leave some clues about where the story is going. The foreshadowing can happen as early as the setup. Brief character profile is essential to any story that involves people. Pick story topics that your listeners will relate to. People drift off when you stop talking about stuff that isn’t them. Your story isn’t a story unless something unexpected or unusual happens. That’s the plot twist. If you don’t have a twist, it’s not a story. </###> Figure out which people are thing people and which ones are people people. Thing people enjoy hearing about new technology and other clever tools and possessions. They also enjoy discussions of processes and systems, including politics. People people enjoy only conversations that involve humans doing interesting things. They get bored in a second when the conversation turns to things. Once you know whether you are dealing with a thing person or a people person, you can craft your conversation to his or her sweet spot. People who appear outgoing are usually employing a learned social skill that you think is somehow natural. It probably isn’t, The simple rule for “I” versus “me” is that the sentence has to make sense if you remove the other person mentioned in the sentence. A theory is a scientific explanation of reality that is so well tested that it is as good as a fact. The correct term for an unproven and untested explanation is “hypothesis.” A good starting point in learning is to go to your preferred online bookstore and search for the topic. Keep reading those books until they seem to be repeating the same tricks. The most effective way to stop people from trying to persuade me is to say, “I’m not interested.” Don’t offer a reason why you aren’t interested. No one can say why a thing holds interest for some and not for others. There’s no argument against a lack of interest. In most groups the craziest person is in control. It starts because no one wants the problems that come from pissing off a crazy person. It’s just smarter and easier sometimes to let the crazy person have his or her way. Crazy people also take more risks and act more confidently than the facts would warrant. Cults are a good example of insanity being viewed as leadership. In any kind of negotiation, the worst thing you can do is act reasonable. Reasonable people generally cave in to irrational people because it seems like the path of least resistance. The way fake insanity works in a negotiation is that you assign a greater value to some element of a deal than an objective observer would consider reasonable. For example, you might demand that a deal be closed before the holidays so you can announce it to your family as a holiday present. When you bring in an emotional dimension, people know they can’t talk you out of it. Emotions don’t bend to reason. I like to form full sentences in my head before I start them. When I know a topic is likely to come up in the near future, I practice entire conversations in my head until I can speak my thoughts fluently. Improve your psychological bravery but say no to anything that has a strong chance of killing you. The unemployment rate for engineers is nearly zero. People who have the right kind of education have almost no risk of unemployment. When you see a successful person who lacks a college education, you’re usually looking at someone with an unusual lack of fear. Successful people treat success as a learnable skill. They figure out what they need and they go and get it. Choose funny books. Experts are right about 98 percent of the time on the easy stuff but only right 50 percent of the time on anything that is unusually complicated, mysterious, or even new. If your gut feeling (intuition) disagrees with the experts, take that seriously. You might be experiencing some pattern recognition that you can’t yet verbalize. Find the people who most represent what you would like to become and spend as much time with them as you can. Pursuing happiness without understanding the mechanisms behind it is like planting a garden without knowing the basics of fertilization, pest control, watering, and frost. It’s easy to pop a seed in the ground, but it takes a deeper understanding of the gardening arts to grow something wonderful. Happiness, like gardening, only seems simple. The timing of things can be more important than the intrinsic value of the things. Happiness has more to do with where you’re heading than where you are. A person who is worth two billion dollars will feel sad if he suddenly loses one billion because he’s moving in the wrong direction, Have a hobby that leaves you plenty of room to improve every year. Slow and steady improvement at anything makes you feel that you are on the right track. Pessimism is often a failure of imagination. If you can’t even imagine an improved future, you won’t be happy no matter how well your life is going right now. Daydreams need not be accurate in terms of predicting the future. Simply imagining a better future hacks your brain chemistry and provides you with the sensation of happiness today. Being happy raises your energy level and makes it easier to pursue the steps toward real-world happiness. The primary culprit in your bad moods is a deficit in one of the big five: flexible schedule, imagination, sleep, diet, and exercise. At times when you’ve exercised earlier in the day, eaten well, hydrated, and had enough sleep, what percentage of those times have you found yourself in a good mood? The Paradox of Choice: That’s why I find great comfort in routine. It’s always the same, at least for the first few hours of my day. Eat something specific, and see how you feel later. Which foods make you energetic and which ones make you sleepy? Struggling to do anything has a steep price because you don’t want to use up your willpower and energy on something as unimportant as staying away from the candy drawer. Inaccurate worldviews are the only kind. You can often get good results from inaccurate worldviews. The happier you are in one area of your life, the less effort you’ll put into searching for happiness elsewhere. Tiredness creates the illusion of hunger. Simplification is often the difference between doing something you know you should do and putting it off. Never exercise so much in one day that you won’t feel like being active the next day. The right amount of exercise today is whatever amount makes me look forward to being active tomorrow. Summary: Focus on your diet first and get that right so you have enough energy to want to exercise. Exercise will further improve your energy. All you need for success is luck. You can’t directly control luck, but you can move from strategies with bad odds to strategies with good odds. For example, learning multiple skills. Pick strategies that scare off the people who fear embarrassment. Most important, understand that goals are for losers and systems are for winners. People who seem to have good luck are often the people who have a system that allows luck to find them.","Random assortment of life tips/hacks from the creator of Dilbert.

No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs,Dan S. Kennedy,1599185091,7,"You want to be very aware, all the time, of the passing of time. (Decide how much you want to make, and divide it into your price-per-hour : your ""governing number"".) If the $340.92 were MY governing number, here's how I would have to use it. First, it'd be on my mind constantly. Is what I'm doing worth $340.92 an hour to do it? Second, it puts a meter on others' consumption of your time-that unnecessary 12-minute phone conversation just cost $68.18. An attorney I know charges: a higher fee to personally handle your case a lower fee to supervise the handling of your case by his staff attorneys yet a lower fee to only consult with your attorney regarding your case. You've got to surround yourself with people who understand and respect the value of your time and behave accordingly. Eliminate the need for doing or delegate those tasks and activities that just cannot and do not match up with the mandated value of your time. If your time isn't worth more than the $5 an hour you could give some neighborhood kid to do menial tasks (mowing lawn), you should be shot. Plus, you're robbing some kid out of the money. Time Vampires love meetings, because a bunch of blood-rich victims gather in one place at one time. It's like a buffet. I had an open-door policy at the office for a while. An endless parade of Time Vampires. Suck, suck, suck. By the end of the day, my neck looked like a pincushion. They just lined up, marched in, and happily took turns siphoning me dry. I put out the vampire welcome mat, and they took me up on the invitation. My fault, of course. ""My life is one long obstacle course, with me being the chief obstacle."" -JACK PAAR Be a business owner instead of being owned by a business. A VIP list with more than two dozen people on it is not a VIP list at all. A person who cannot keep appointments on time, cannot keep scheduled commitments, or cannot stick to a schedule cannot be trusted in other ways either. People who can't be punctual can't be trusted. It is 6:00 A.M. And here I am, at the keyboard, in my home office, writing. That's what I do almost every day, for at least the first early hour of the morning, no matter what. Self-discipline is the magic power that makes you virtually unstoppable. Self-discipline is MAGNETIC. And self-discipline aimed and applied at a particular thing, as I do to writing, as Pincay does to fitness, is quite literally a magic power. When you focus your self-discipline on a single purpose, like sunlight through a magnifying glass on a single object, look out! The whole world will scramble to get out of your way, hold the doors open for you, and salute as you walk by. It takes tremendous self-discipline to productively allocate and invest time and to stick to your intentions. Because the entrepreneur is his own boss and can do as he pleases with his time, it is very important to be self-disciplined. The entrepreneur with a loose, buddy-buddy, easily forgiving boss will never accomplish much. It is the entrepreneur with the tough taskmaster as a boss who excels. If you couldn't find a heroic, successful role model, then just look at what everybody else is doing and don't do that. My business - the information business - revolves around the public's stubborn belief that there must be a ""secret"" to success, concealed from them, possibly by conspiracy, that if uncovered, would change everything. If you are not achieving what you feel you should in life, it is because your goals are not defined well enough. Ideally, you should schedule your day by the half-hour, from beginning to end. For every action, there is an equal or opposite criticism. The less I do, the more I make. You must systematically, aggressively divest yourself of those activities you do not do well, do not do happily, or find routine, so as to systematically invest your time (and talent, knowledge, know-how, and other resources) in those things you do extraordinarily well, enjoy doing, and find intellectually stimulating. Good enough is good enough. Many, many things can be delegated to people who will not do them the way you would, won't do them as perfectly as you would, but will wind up with the same result. Every one of these things should be delegated. In fact, you MUST delegate. You cannot move ahead without jettisoning some responsibilities and tasks in order to make room for new, more valuable tasks and responsibilities. If you have anybody around you with intelligence and talent, you must keep giving them new, more important responsibilities and getting them to delegate. You MUST master this difficult skill. To delegate effectively, here's the seven-step process: 1. Define what is to be done. 2. Be certain the delegatee understands what is to be done. 3. Explain why it is to be done as you are prescribing it to be done. 4. Teach how it is to be done without micro-micro-managing. 5. Be sure the delegatee understands the how-to process. 6. Set the deadline for completion or progress report. 7. Be sure you have agreement to the date or time and method. Fire yourself! You'll make more money and have more fun. Many entrepreneurs are so busy doing the $10.00-an-hour jobs, they never get to do the $100.00-an-hour job: marketing to bring in new customers, and to keep customers coming back. There are a lot of people you can hire to make the sauce, but there's hardly anybody you can hire to effectively market and promote the restaurant. My ""Dan as Center of Universe Strategy"": me in the middle and satellite businesses owned and managed by others all based on me, my writings, my other content, all paying me.

Get free of as many other aspects of your business as you can, get passionately interested in and good at marketing, and invest your time there. Why? Because it is infinitely easier to find or train someone to take care of a business' operations than it is to get someone to do its marketing. Marketing is the highestpaid profession and most valuable part of a business.

My mother said to me, ""If you become a soldier you'll be a general; if you become a monk, you'll end up as the Pope."" Instead, I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. -PABLO PICASSO There is a certain state of mind that best facilitates achieving peak productivity. You can best create that state of mind as needed, when needed, at will, by mastering certain Psycho-Cybernetics techniques. For example, Dr. Maltz talked about ""clearing the calculator."" If you have a simple calculator laying around, get it, and take a look at it. You'll find that you have to hit the ""clear"" button and either store in memory or completely clear away one problem before you employ the calculator to solve another. Many people go through great physical and mental gyrations just getting ready to get ready to write. I don't. I can sit down, put my fingers on the keys, clear my calculator in 60 seconds or less, and write. http://www.psycho-cybernetics.com/ Populating my work environment with ""psychological triggers""-objects that remind me to think a certain way. I work at mentally attracting wealth, for example, so my primary work environment is full of things that represent wealth; at last count, 27 such pictures, objects, and artifacts were within view. Because I am very concerned with time, I have eight clocks around me. I have a wooden hangman's noose to remind me of deadlines. Nobody's entitled to anything but opportunity. Here's how to get focused, if you're having trouble in that department: identify and write down the three most important, most significant, most productive, most valuable things you can do to foster success in your particular enterprise. Just three. Write them down. From there, translate them into three actions you can take each and everyday. Write them down. One of the most important things to me is a continuous stream of new requests for my services. As long as this demand for ""me"" exceeds the available supply of ""me,"" I can demand and get premium fees, insist on first-class travel, choose clients I like and blow off those I don't, choose projects that interest me and reject those I don't, confidently turn away business knowing the temporary vacuum will fill, and generally do as I darned well please. But if I let the demand diminish so that supply exceeds demand, I have to start compromising all over the place. So this is very important to me. What can I do every day to be certain this demand-supply ratio stays weighted in my favor? I do not let a day go by that I do not send out a letter or a package, make or return a phone call, get an article published, do something to keep my books on bookstore shelves, secure a highprofile speaking engagement, or do something else to create and stimulate ""deal flow."" Nothing and no one can steal the time required to make certain that happens. Every single day. No exceptions. No excuses. As a direct result, ""demand"" for me has steadily grown, even as the ""supply"" I am willing to offer has diminished, which has allowed me to very substantially raise my fees, keep raising them every year, fire troublesome clients without remorse, and do business entirely on my terms, to suit me. This one single, simple discipline has been worth millions. Jim Rohn was one of Tony Robbins' earliest coaches, mentors, and employers. Well, it's no wonder he's doing so well. Look at everything he does. Look very closely at the one thing or two or three things he gets done without fail, every single day. Dentist: ""I've made a list of 300 things to change in the practice."" Every week, he did ten of them. After 30 weeks, he had done everything on that list, big and small. And, without a penny increase in advertising, without a dollar's difference in marketing, in the same office, with (almost) the same staff, his practice had more than quadrupled in volume. Two overriding supervisory rules that you'll want to remember. 1. Expect the best. Expectations have enormous impact on results. And conveyed expectations have great impact on most people. Most folks are smarter and more capable than we give them credit for. Some never get challenged. 2. Know that you only have the right to expect what you inspect. Performance improves with measurement and accountability to someone else. For each person you delegate to, have a list of everything, big or small, that you turn over to that person. As each one responds, you can mark off the items. Every so often, check the list for the lagging items. Highly successful people do what they need to do, whether they like it or not, in order to get the results they want. I did a little pro bono consulting with the Arizona Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation about securing more, new corporate sponsors for their telethon. The Foundation couldn't get the key CEOs it wanted to talk with to give them the time of day. That's because Foundation representatives were talking about the Arthritis Foundation. I created a new message aimed at these CEOs-telling them about new, creative, very-low cost opportunities to get massive, prestigious public recognition for their companies featuring prime TV advertising at about 25 cents on the dollar vs. what they would normally pay. I created a letter that played to their egos, presented a logical case, had something new to offer, and hit the fear button-that their competitors might beat them out for an exclusive. Some of these busy CEOs called the very same day they got my letter. Companies such as Federal Express and Domino's Pizza raced to get involved.",Repeated message: Your time is precious. Know its value and don't work for less. Defend it against time-vampires. Be hard to reach. Make every minute count. Do only the valuable tasks. Good conventional wisdom.
What Technology Wants,Kevin Kelly,25993340,7,"Technium : a coined word to designate the greater, global, massively interconnected system of technology. Seeing our world through technology’s eyes has, for me, illuminated its larger purpose. And recognizing what it wants has reduced much of my own conflict in deciding where to place myself in its embrace. Online networks connect people with ideas, options, and other people they could not possibly have met otherwise. Online networks unleashed passions, compounded creativity, amplified generosity. I keep technology at arm’s length so that I can more easily remember who I am. For centuries, scholars called the making of things ""craft"", and the expression of inventiveness ""art"". However you define life, its essence does not reside in material forms like DNA, tissue, or flesh, but in the intangible organization of the energy and information contained in those material forms. If a thousand lines of letters in UNIX qualifies as a technology, then a thousand lines of letters in English must qualify as well. Both can change our behavior, alter the course of events, or enable future inventions. The wants of a protozoan are unconscious, unarticulated - more like an urge or a tendency. LANGUAGE: The creation of language was the first singularity for humans. It changed everything. Life after language was unimaginable to those on the far side before it. LANGUAGE: A new idea can be spread quickly if someone can explain it and communicate it to others before they have to discover it themselves. But the chief advantage of language is not communication but autogeneration. Language is a trick that allows the mind to question itself; a magic mirror that reveals to the mind what the mind thinks; a handle that turns a mind into a tool. With a grip on the slippery, aimless activity of self-awareness and self-reference, language can harness a mind into a fountain of new ideas. Without the cerebral structure of language, we couldn’t access our own mental activity. We certainly couldn’t think the way we do. If our minds can’t tell stories, we can’t consciously create; we can only create by accident. Until we tame the mind with an organization tool capable of communicating to itself, we have stray thoughts without a narrative. We have a feral mind. We have smartness without a tool. In many contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes, being unencumbered with things is considered a virtue, even a virtue of character. You carry nothing; instead, you cleverly make or procure whatever you need when you need it. The more nomadic a tribe was, the more peaceful it would be, since it could simply flee from conflict. We have become deeply dependent on technology. If all technology - every last knife and spear - were to be removed from this planet, our species would not last more than a few months. We are now symbiotic with technology. The invention of moveable-type printing in Europe encouraged Christians to read their religion’s founding text themselves and make their own interpretations, and that launched the very idea of “protest” within and against religion. The hard two-meter mound of a termite colony operates as if it were an external organ of the insects: The mound’s temperature is regulated and it is repaired after injury. The dried mud itself seems to be living. What we think of as coral - stony, treelike structures - are the apartment buildings of nearly invisible coral animals. The coral structure and coral animals behave as one. A shelter is animal technology, the animal extended. The extended human is the technium. Clothes are people’s extended skin, wheels extended feet, camera and telescopes extended eyes. Many of a technology’s parts are shared by other technologies, so a great deal of development happens automatically as components improve in other uses ‘outside’ the host technology. The major transitions in the technium are: Primate communication → Language Oral lore → Writing/mathematical notation Scripts → Printing Book knowledge → Scientific method Artisan production → Mass production Industrial culture → Ubiquitous global communication Inadvertent anticipatory inventions are called exaptations. In my own travels around the world I was struck by how resilient ancient technologies were, how they were often first choices where power and modern resources were scarce. It seemed to me as if no technologies ever disappeared. I was able to find every single item listed on a page of a century-old catalog. Each old tool was available in a new incarnation and sold on the web. Nothing was dead. The hydrogen atoms in a human body completely refresh every seven years. As we age we are really a river of cosmically old atoms. The carbons in our bodies were produced in the dust of a star. The bulk of matter in our hands, skin, eyes, and hearts was made near the beginning of time, billions of years ago. The computer chip conducts more energy per second per gram through its tiny corridors than animals, volcanoes, or the sun. This bit of high technology is the most energetically active thing in the known universe. In one year 1 eagle eats 100 trout, which eat 10,000 grasshoppers, which eat 1 million blades of grass. Thus it takes, indirectly, 1 million blades of grass to support 1 eagle. But this pile of 1 million blades far outweighs the eagle. This bloated inefficiency is due to entropy. Each movement in an animal’s life wastes a small bit of heat (entropy), which means every predator catches less energy than the total energy the prey consumed, and this shortfall is multiplied by each action for all time. The circle of life is kept going only by the constant replenishment of sunlight showering the grass with new energy. For four billion years evolution has been accumulating knowledge in its library of genes. You can learn a lot in four billion years. Every one of the 30 million or so unique species alive on the planet today is an unbroken informational thread that traces back to the very first cell. That thread (DNA) learns something new each generation and adds that hard-won knowledge to its code. Data from nearly all parts of the world show us that consumers tend to spend relatively less on goods and more on services as their incomes rise. Once people have met their basic needs, they tend to want medical care, transportation and communication, information, recreation, entertainment, financial and legal advice, and the like. Thinking about thoughts will only make us marginally smarter. The power of the technium can be increased indefinitely by reflecting its transforming nature upon itself. New technologies constantly make it easier to invent better technologies. We can’t say the same about human brains. In ancient times when a bearded prophet forecast what was to come, the news was generally bad. The idea that the future brought improvement was never very popular until recently. The steady destruction of good things and people seems relentless. And it is. But the steady stream of good things is relentless as well. There is more good than evil in the world - but not by much. What money brings is increased choices, rather than merely increased stuff. We do find happiness in having some control of our time and work, a chance for real leisure, in the escape from the uncertainties of war, poverty, and corruption, and in a chance to pursue individual freedoms. Over time our laws, mores, and ethics have slowly expanded the sphere of human empathy. Generally, humans originally identified themselves primarily via their families. The family clan was “us.” This declaration cast anyone outside of that intimacy as “other.” We had - and still have - different rules of behavior for those inside the circle of “us” and for those outside. Gradually the circle of “us” enlarged from inside the family clan to inside the tribe, and then from tribe to nation. We are currently in an unfinished expansion beyond nation and maybe even race and may soon be crossing the species boundary. Other primates are, more and more, deemed worthy of humanlike rights. If the golden rule of morality and ethics is to “do unto others as you would have others do unto you,” then we are constantly expanding our notion of “others.” This is evidence for moral progress. Citizens in developing countries can merely take a bus back to their villages, where they can live with age-old traditions and limited choice. They will not starve. In a similar spirit of choice, if you believe that the peak of existence was reached in Neolithic times, you can camp out in a clearing in the Amazon. If you think the golden age was in the 1890s, you can find a farm among the Amish. We have lots of opportunity to revisit the past, but few people really want to live there. Everywhere in the world, at all historical periods, in all cultures, people have stampeded by the billions into the future of “slightly more options” as fast as they can. With their feet they have voted for progress by migrating to cities. Every beautiful city begins as a slum. When a town prospers it acquires a center - civic or religious - and the edges of the city continue to expand in unplanned, ungovernable messiness. Babylon, London, and New York all had teeming ghettos of unwanted settlers erecting shoddy shelters with inadequate hygiene and engaging in dodgy dealings. Even by the 1780s, when Paris was at its peak, nearly 20 percent of its residents did not have a “fixed abode” - that is, they lived in shacks. This is how all technology works. A gadget begins as a junky prototype and then progresses to something that barely works. The ad hoc shelters in slums are upgraded over time, infrastructure is extended, and eventually makeshift services become official. What was once the home of poor hustlers becomes, over the span of generations, the home of rich hustlers. Propagating slums is what cities do, and living in slums is how cities grow. The majority of neighborhoods in almost every modern city are merely successful former slums. The squatter cities of today will become the blue-blood neighborhoods of tomorrow. This is already happening in Rio and Mumbai today. Every slum boasts eateries and bars, and most have rooming houses or places you can rent a bed. They have animals, fresh milk, grocery stores, barber shops, healers, herb stores, repair stands, and strong armed men offering “protection.” A squatter city is, and has always been, a shadow city, a parallel world without official permission, but a city nonetheless. Suketu Mehta, author of Maximum City (about Mumbai), says, “Why would anyone leave a brick house in the village with its two mango trees and its view of small hills in the East to come here?” Then he answers: “So that someday the eldest son can buy two rooms in Mira Road, at the northern edges of the city. And the younger one can move beyond that, to New Jersey. Discomfort is an investment.” The freedom in a city makes their village seem a prison. Inventions, such as language, writing, law, and science, have ignited a level of progress that is so fundamental and embedded in the present that we now naively expect to see similar good things in the past as well. But much of what we consider “civil” or even “humane” was absent long ago. By systematically recording the evidence for beliefs and investigating the reasons why things worked and then carefully distributing proven innovations, science quickly became the greatest tool for making new things the world had ever seen. Science was in fact a superior method for a culture to learn. Science is costly for an individual. Sharing results is of marginal benefit if you are chiefly seeking a better tool for today. Therefore, the benefits of science are neither apparent nor immediate for individuals. Science requires a certain density of leisured population willing to share and support failures to thrive. That leisure is generated by pre-science inventions. Techniques that permit a steady surplus of food for large numbers of people. In other words, science needs prosperity and populations. It is the increase in the number of humans that ultimately drives science, and then prosperity. Hundreds of scholarly papers record substantial improvements across the board in matters we care about. The trajectories of these measurements generally point in the same direction: up. Their accumulated weight elicited this famous prediction by Julian Simon a decade ago: These are my most important long-run predictions, contingent on there being no global war or political upheaval: (1) People will live longer lives than now; fewer will die young. (2) Families all over the world will have higher incomes and better standards of living than now. (3) The costs of natural resources will be lower than at present. (4) Agricultural land will continue to become less and less important as an economic asset, relative to the total value of all other economic assets. These four predictions are quite certain because the very same predictions, made at all earlier times in history, would have turned out to be right. His reason is worth repeating: He is betting on a historical force that has maintained its trajectory for many centuries. The eye has evolved independently between 40 and 60 times around the animal kingdom. Most methods used by life are used by more than one organism and in more than one phylum. What is rare is a trait that has not been reused somewhere in nature. While a mouse’s heart and lungs beat rapidly compared to an elephant’s, both mouse and elephant count the same number of beats and breaths per life. It is as if mammals are assigned 1.5 billion heartbeats. There is a tilt to evolution’s seemingly chaotic churning that rediscovers the same forms and keeps arriving at the same solutions. It is almost as if life has an imperative. It “wants” to materialize certain patterns. The incredible complexity of life disguises its singularity. There is only one life. All life today is descended along an unbroken line of duplication from one ancient molecule that worked inside one primeval cell that worked. Despite life’s magnificent diversity, it is chiefly repeating, billions of billions of times, solutions that worked before. Alfred Russel Wallace came up with the same theory of evolution as Darwin, at approximately the same time, 150 years ago. Weirdly, both Wallace and Darwin found the theory of natural selection after reading the same book on population growth by Thomas Malthus. Darwin did not publish his revelation until provoked by Wallace’s parallel discovery. Alexander Bell and Elisha Gray both applied to patent the telephone on the same day, February 14, 1876. Improbable simultaneity (Gray applied three hours before Bell). Sunspots were first discovered not by two but by four separate observers, including Galileo, in the same year, 1611. We know of six different inventors of the thermometer, and three of the hypodermic needle. The higher the prominence of a scientist, the greater the number of simultaneous discoveries he participated in. Great discoverers not only contribute more than the average number of “next” steps, but they also take part in those steps that have the greatest impact, which are naturally the areas of investigation that attract many other players and so produce multiples. If discovery is a lottery, the greatest discoverers buy lots of tickets. The whole history of inventions is one endless chain of parallel instances. No matter what they rationally think about inevitability, in my experience all inventors and creators act as if their own invention and discovery is imminently simultaneous. Every creator, inventor, and discoverer that I have known is rushing their ideas into distribution before someone else does, or they are in a mad hurry to patent before their competition does, or they are dashing to finish their masterpiece before something similar shows up. Nathan Myhrvold is a polymath and serial inventor who used to direct fast-paced research at Microsoft but wanted to accelerate the pace of innovation in other areas outside the digital realm - such as surgery, metallurgy, or archaeology - where innovation was often a second thought. Myhrvold came up with an idea factory called Intellectual Ventures. Myhrvold employs an interdisciplinary team of very bright innovators to sit around and dream up patentable ideas. These eclectic one- or two-day gatherings will generate 1,000 patents per year. Once an idea is “in the air” its many manifestations are inevitable. You just need a sufficient number of smart, prolific people to start catching them. And of course a lot of patent lawyers to patent what you generate in bulk. An innovative prototype shop called Applied Minds is another idea factory. They generate tons of ideas in interdisciplinary areas: bioengineering, toys, computer vision, amusement rides, military control rooms, cancer diagnostics, and mapping tools. Some ideas they sell as unadorned patents; others they complete as physical machines or operational software. “There might be tens of thousands of people who conceive the possibility of the same invention at the same time. But less than one in ten of them imagines how it might be done. Of these who see how to do it, only one in ten will actually think through the practical details and specific solutions. Of these only one in ten will actually get the design to work for very long. And finally, usually only one of all those many thousands with the idea will get the invention to stick in the culture. At our lab we engage in all these levels of discovery, in the expected proportions.” If Rowling had not written Harry Potter, someone else would have written a similar story in broad outlines, because so many have already produced parallel parts. But the Harry Potter books, the ones that exist in their exquisite peculiar details, could not have been written by anyone other than Rowling. It is not the particular genius of human individuals like Rowling that is inevitable but the unfolding genius of the technium as a whole. Discoveries become virtually inevitable when prerequisite kinds of knowledge and tools accumulate. In addition to instruments and tools, a discovery needs the proper beliefs, expectations, vocabulary, explanation, know-how, resources, funds, and appreciation to appear. Fancy technology introduced in developing countries typically reaches only 5 percent penetration before it stalls. It doesn’t disseminate further until older foundational technologies catch up. Countries that failed to adopt old technologies are at a disadvantage when it comes to new ones. The progression of inventions is in many ways the march toward forms dictated by physics and chemistry in a sequence determined by the rules of complexity. We might call this technology’s imperative. These days all technology follows computer technology. Moore’s Law is really about people’s belief system, it’s not a law of physics, it’s about human belief, and when people believe in something, they’ll put energy behind it to make it come to pass. This freely chosen aspect of ourselves is what other people remember about us. How we handle life’s cascade of real choices within the larger cages of our birth and background is what makes us who we are. It is what people talk about when we are gone. Not the given, but the choices we made. Ordinary Roman carts were constructed to match the width of imperial Roman war chariots because it was easier to follow the ruts in the road left by the war chariots. The chariots were sized to accommodate the width of two large warhorses, which translates into our English measurement of 4’ 8.5”. Roads throughout the vast Roman Empire were built to this specification. When the legions of Rome marched into Britain, they constructed long-distance imperial roads 4’ 8.5” wide. When the English started building tramways, they used the same width so the same horse carriages could be used. And when they started building railways with horseless carriages, naturally the rails were 4’ 8.5” wide. Imported laborers from the British Isles built the first railways in the Americas using the same tools and jigs they were used to. Fast-forward to the U.S. space shuttle, which is built in parts around the country and assembled in Florida. Because the two large solid-fuel rocket engines on the side of the launch shuttle were sent by railroad from Utah, and that line traversed a tunnel not much wider than the standard track, the rockets themselves could not be much wider in diameter than 4’ 8.5”. Technology is shaped by a triad of forces. The primary driver is preordained development - what technology wants. The second driver is the influence of technological history, the gravity of the past, as in the way the size of a horse’s yoke determines the size of a space rocket. The third force is society’s collective free will in shaping the technium, or our choices. The better we can forecast, the better we can be prepared for what comes. If we can discern the large outlines of persistent forces, we can better educate our children in the appropriate skills and literacies need for thriving in that world. Teenagers are biologically compelled to take risks as a means of establishing their independence. The urge for self-preservation, self-extension, and self-growth is the natural state of any living thing. We don’t begrudge the selfish nature of a lion, or a grasshopper, or ourselves. Each new technology creates more problems than it solves. Problems are the answers to solutions. Most of the new problems in the world are problems created by previous technology. These technogenic problems are nearly invisible to us. Every year 1.2 million people die in automobile accidents. The dominant technological transportation system kills more people than cancer. I cannot imagine a technology that cannot be made orders of magnitude greener. The nature of technology is inherently pro-life. It just needs to grow into that potential. We often confuse a clear view of the future with a short distance. When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves FORCED to use it. We willingly choose technology, with its great defects and obvious detriments, because we unconsciously calculate its virtues. In an entirely wordless calculus, we note the addictions in others, the degradations in the environment, the distractions in our own lives, the confusion about character that various technologies generate, and then we sum these up against the benefits. We freely choose to embrace it - and pay the price. The way to reveal the full costs of technology and deflate its hype is with better information tools and processes. We require technologies such as real-time self-monitoring of our use, transparent sharing of problems, deep analysis of testing results, relentless retesting, accurate recording of the chain of sources in manufacturing, and honest accounting of negative externalities such as pollution. The Amish are living about 50 years behind us. By that time, the benefits and costs are clear, the technology stable, and it is cheap. They have criteria by which to make choices: Technologies must enhance family and community and distance themselves from the outside world. Their motto is “try first and relinquish later, if need be.” Our Amish friend Leon spoke of the same equation: fewer distractions, more satisfaction. The ever-ready embrace of his community was palpable. Imagine it: Neighbors would pay your medical bill if needed, or build your house in a few weeks without pay, and, more important, allow you to do the same for them. Minimal technology, unburdened by cultural innovations such as insurance or credit cards, forces a daily reliance on neighbors and friends. Hospital stays are paid by church members, who also visit the sick regularly. The Amish depend on the outside world for the way they currently live. Their choice of minimal technology adoption is a choice - but a choice enabled by the technium. Their lifestyle is within the technium, not outside it. Outside technological America the idea seems crazy. This opt-out option makes sense only when there is something to opt out of. Entrepreneurship: The origins of the Wired generation and the long-hair computer culture (think open-source UNIX) lay in the counterculture dropouts of the 70s. As Stewart Brand, hippie founder of the Whole Earth Catalog, remembers, “‘Do your own thing’ easily translated into ‘Start your own business.’” The hippies left for the same reason Thoreau left his Walden; they both came and left to experience life to its fullest. Voluntary simplicity is a possibility, an option, a choice that one should experience for at least part of one’s life. I highly recommend elective poverty and minimalism as a fantastic education, not least because it will help you sort out your technology priorities. But I have observed that simplicity’s fullest potential requires that one consider minimalism one phase of many. As the technium explodes with new self-made options, we find it harder to find fulfillment. How can we be fulfilled when we don’t know what is being filled? I believe these two different routes for technological lifestyle - either optimizing contentment or optimizing choices - come down to very different ideas of what humans are to be. It is only possible to optimize human satisfaction if you believe human nature is fixed. Needs cannot be maximally satisfied if they are in flux. Minimal technologists maintain that human nature is unchanging. Technology is anything that was invented after you were born. Human nature itself is a malleable crop. Our nature has never been static. Genetically our bodies are changing faster now than at any time in the past million years. Our minds are being rewired by our culture. The more advanced the technology, on the whole, the more possible it is for a considerable number of human beings to imagine being somebody else. Your potential has been given an opportunity by the work of others. You are being expanded as others expand themselves. Our mission as humans is not only to discover our fullest selves in the technium, and to find full contentment, but to expand the possibilities for others. Greater technology will selfishly unleash our talents, but it will also unselfishly unleash others: our children, and all children to come. Anyone who is inventing, discovering, and expanding possibilities will indirectly expand possibilities for others. I do want the minimum because I’ve learned that I have limited time and attention. The technium’s dilemma very clearly: To maximize our own contentment, we seek the minimum amount of technology in our lives. Yet to maximize the contentment of others, we must maximize the amount of technology in the world. Indeed, we can only find our own minimal tools if others have created a sufficient maximum pool of options we can choose from. The dilemma remains in how we can personally minimize stuff close to us while trying to expand it globally. Can the human mind master what the human mind has made? We opt out of more technology than we opt in to. Our personal nonadoption is usually illogical and nonsensical. Prohibition seems very ephemeral. While an item may be banned in one place, it will thrive in another. In a global marketplace, nothing is eliminated. Where a technology is banned locally, it slips away to pool somewhere else on the globe. Young technologies often experience failure in their first careers before they find a better livelihood later. Switching occupations is the norm for technology. Our immediate tendency is to imagine the new thing doing an old job better. That’s why the first cars were called “horseless carriages.” The first movies were simply straightforward documentary films of theatrical plays. It took a while to realize the full dimensions of cinema photography as its own new medium. We may obsess about the risks of pesticides but not the risks of organic foods. People will accept a thousand times as much risk for technologies or situations that are voluntary rather than mandatory. The missionary wanted to improve the laborious way the Chinese peasants in his province harvested grain. The local farmers clipped the stalks with some kind of small hand shear. So the missionary had a scythe shipped in from America and demonstrated its superior productivity to an enthralled crowd. The next morning, however, a delegation came to see the missionary. “The scythe must be destroyed at once. What , if it should fall into the hands of thieves; a whole field could be cut and carried away in a single night!” And so the scythe was banished, progress stopped, because nonusers could imagine a possible - but wholly improbable - way it could significantly harm their society. In its efforts to be “safe rather than sorry,” precaution becomes myopic. It tends to maximize only one value: safety. Safety trumps innovation. The safest thing to do is to perfect what works and never try anything that could fail, because failure is inherently unsafe. Safety components can become one more opportunity for things to go wrong. For instance, adding security forces at an airport can increase the number of people with access to critical areas, which is a decrease in security. Redundant systems, normally a safety backup, can easily breed new types of errors. The surest remedy for uncertainty is faster, better scientific studies. More science, done openly by skeptics and enthusiasts, will enable us to sooner say: “This is okay to use” or “This is not okay to use.” Once a consensus forms, we can regulate reasonably - as we have with lead in gasoline, tobacco, seat belts, and many other mandated improvements in society. But in the meantime we should count on uncertainty. Emerging technology must be tested in action and evaluated in real time. In other words, the risks of a particular technology have to be determined by trial and error in real life. The appropriate response to a new idea should be to immediately try it out. And to keep trying it out, and testing it, as long as it exists. Proactionary Principle: emphasizes provisional assessment and constant correction, a heuristic to guide us in assessing new technologies. 1. Anticipation Try to imagine as many horrors as glories, as many glories as horrors, and if possible to anticipate ubiquity; what happens if everyone has this for free? Anticipation should not be a judgment. The purpose of anticipation is not to accurately predict what will happen with a technology, because all precise predictions are wrong, but to prepare a base for the next four steps. It is a way to rehearse future actions. 2. Continual Assessment Test everything we use all the time, not just once. 3. Prioritization of Risks. 4. Rapid Correction of Harm The assumption that any given technology will create problems should be part of its process of creation. 5. Not Prohibition but Redirection Prohibition and relinquishment of dubious technologies do not work. Instead, find them new jobs. A technology can play different roles in society. It can have more than one expression. It can be set with different defaults. We have the choice of how we treat our creations, where we place them, and how we train them with our values. The most helpful metaphor for understanding technology may be to consider humans as the parents of our technological children. We can only shape technology’s expression by engaging with it, by riding it with both arms around its neck. To do that means to embrace those technologies now. To create them, turn them on, try them. A convivial manifestation of a technology offers: • Cooperation. It promotes collaboration between people and institutions. • Transparency. Its origins and ownership are clear. Its workings are intelligible to nonexperts. There is no asymmetrical advantage of knowledge to some of its users. • Decentralization. Its ownership, production, and control are distributed. It is not monopolized by a professional elite. • Flexibility. It is easy for users to modify, adapt, improve, or inspect its core. Individuals may freely choose to use it or give it up. • Redundancy. It is not the only solution, not a monopoly, but one of several options. • Efficiency. It minimizes impact on ecosystems. It has a high efficiency for energy and materials and is easy to reuse. Technology wants what life wants: Increasing efficiency Increasing opportunity Increasing emergence Increasing complexity Increasing diversity Increasing specialization Increasing ubiquity Increasing freedom Increasing mutualism Increasing beauty Increasing sentience Increasing structure Increasing evolvability This list of exotropic trends can serve as a sort of checklist to help us evaluate new technologies and predict their development. It can guide us in guiding them. These trajectories are like the pull of gravity on water. Water “wants” to leak out of the bottom of a dam. It is inevitable that someday the water will leak out - even though it may be retained by the dam for centuries. There is no limit to the most complex things we will make. We’ll dazzle ourselves with new complexity in many directions. This will complexify our lives further, but we’ll adapt to it. There is no going back. We’ll hide this complexity with beautiful “simple” interfaces, as elegant as the round ball of an orange. But behind this membrane our stuff will be more complex than the cells and biochemistry of an orange. To keep up with this complexification, our language, tax codes, government bureaucracies, news media, and daily lives will all become more complex as well. It’s a trend we can count on. The long arc of complexity began before evolution, worked through the four billion years of life, and now continues through the technium. Too many choices may induce regret, but “no choice” is a far worse option. Civilization is a steady migration away from “no choice.” As always, the solution to the problems that technology brings, such as an overwhelming diversity of choices, is better technologies. The solution to ultradiversity will be choice-assist technologies. These better tools will aid humans in making choices among bewildering options. Where do wealthy people travel to? Places that retain differences. (Bali.) What eateries attract customers? The ones with distinctive characteristics. What products sell in a global market? Ones that think different. Cultural differences that thrive without isolation (even if they were born out of it) will compound in value as the world becomes standardized. We adopt new technologies largely because of what they do for us, but also in part because of what they mean to us. Often we refuse to adopt technology for the same reason: because of how the avoidance reinforces or shapes our identity. ########## 10 universal tendencies carrying us forward: ### COMPLEXITY the broad rise of complexity across all epochs of evolutionary time. ### DIVERSITY The diversity of the universe has been increasing since the beginning of time. ### SPECIALIZATION Evolution moves from the general to the specific. This sequence from general to specific holds true for most technologies. Today there are hundreds of specialty cameras, including those for use deep underwater, those designed for the vacuum of space, and those able to capture the infrared or the ultraviolet. At the moment, computers seem to be headed in the opposite direction, toward becoming ever more general-purpose machines, as they swallow more and more functions. This convergence is temporary. We are still in the early stages of computerization - or rather, intelligenation. Everywhere we currently apply our own personal intelligence (in other words, everywhere we work and play) we are rapidly applying artificial and collective intelligence as well, and rapidly overhauling our tools and expectations. We’ve intelligenized bookkeeping, photography, financial trading, metal machining, and airplane piloting, among thousands of other tasks. We are about to computerize automobile driving, medical diagnosis, and speech understanding. In our rush toward large-scale intelligenation, we first installed the general-purpose PC, with its mass-produced small brain, midsize screen, and conduit to the net. So all chores get the same tool. To complete the dispersion of intelligenation into all occupations will probably require another decade. Silly as it now sounds, we will put artificial intelligence into hammers, dental picks, forklifts, stethoscopes, and frying pans. All these tools will gain new powers by sharing the universal intelligence of the network. But as their newly augmented roles become clear, the tools will specialize. We can see the first glimmers in the iPhone, Kindle, Wii, tablets, and netbooks. Gamers want minimal latency; readers want maximum legibility; hikers want waterproofing; kids want indestructibility. We can forecast the future of almost any invention working today by imagining it evolving into dozens of narrow uses. Technology is born in generality and grows to specificity. ### UBIQUITY The consequence of self-reproduction in life, as well as in the technium, is an inherent drive toward ever-presence. Given a chance, dandelions or raccoons or fire ants will replicate till they cover the Earth. Evolution equips a replicant with tricks to maximize its spread no matter the constraints. The list of near-ubiquitous technologies includes cotton cloth, iron blades, plastic bottles, paper, and radio signals. These five technological species are within reach of nearly every human alive today, Ubiquity changes everything. One thousand live, always-on cameras make downtowns safe from pickpockets, nab stoplight runners, and record police misbehavior. One billion live, always-on cameras serve as a community monitor and memory, they give the job of eyewitness to amateurs, they restructure the notion of the self, and they reduce the authority of authorities. Usually what happens to a ubiquitous technology is that it disappears. The electric motor has seeped into ubiquity and invisibility. There is no longer one home motor in a household; there are dozens of them, and each is nearly invisible. No longer stand-alone devices, motors are now integral parts of many appliances. We don’t think of paper and cotton clothing as technology because their reliable presences are everywhere. The “haves and have-laters.”: the haves fund the evolution of technology for the have-laters. Isn’t that how it should be, that the rich fund the development of cheap technology for the poor? I would say the same today about DNA sequencing, GPS location tracking, dirt-cheap solar panels, electric cars, or even nutrition. Don’t worry about those who don’t own a personal fiber-optic cable to their school; worry what happens when everyone does. We were so focused on those who don’t have plenty to eat that we missed what happens when everyone does have plenty. ### FREEDOM As evolution rises, “choicefulness” increases. There is nothing we have invented to date about which we’ve said, “It’s smart enough.” The more powerful a new technology is, the greater the new freedoms it opens up. ### MUTUALISM As life evolves, it becomes increasingly dependent on other life. Every organism that creates a successful niche for itself also creates potential niches for other species. Greater sociality among organisms is a stabilizing ratchet in evolution. Most trucks, trains, and planes are not moving people but freight. Most heating and cooling is not conditioning humans but other stuff. The technium spends only one quarter of its energy on human comfort, food, and travel needs; the rest of the energy is made by technology for technology. For the next 10 to 20 years, the socializing aspects of the technium will be one of its major traits and a major event for our culture. Right now we are using technology to collaboratively build encyclopedias, news agencies, video archives, and software in groups that span continents. Can we build bridges, universities, and charter cities the same way? Every day over the past century someone asked, What can’t free markets do? We took a long list of problems that seemed to require rational planning or paternal government and instead applied the astoundingly powerful invention of marketplace logic. In most cases, the market solution worked significantly better. Much of the prosperity in recent decades was gained by unleashing market forces into the technium. Now we’re trying the same trick with the emerging technologies of collaboration, applying these techniques to a growing list of wishes - and occasionally to problems that the free market couldn’t solve - to see if they work. We are asking ourselves, What can’t technological mutualism do? Each time we reinvent something, we’ll make it yet more mutualistic. ### BEAUTY Most evolved things are beautiful, and the most beautiful are the most highly evolved. Many centuries ago the first few versions of London were considered heinous eyesores. But over generations, every urban block in London was tested by daily use. The parks and streets that worked were retained; those that failed were demolished. The places most renowned for their beauty (Venice, Kyoto, Esfahan) are those that reveal intersecting deep layers of time. While our lay minds can’t decode why, we interpret that fossilized learning as beauty. It has less to do with smooth lines and more to do with smooth continuity of experience. The attractive scissors and the beautiful hammer and the gorgeous car all carry in their form the wisdom of their ancestors. The web smells like life. It knows so much. It has insinuated its tendrils of connection into everything, everywhere. Technology does not want to remain utilitarian. It wants to become art, to be beautiful and “useless.” Burning candles is now a mark of luxuriant uselessness. ### SENTIENCE The honeyguide bird in Kenya lures humans to wild bee nests so that the birds can feast on the remaining bee brood after the humans remove the honey; sometimes, according to ornithologists, the honeyguide will “deceive” the hunters about the actual distance to a deep forest nest if it is more than two kilometers away, so as not to discourage them. Humans have a chauvinistic bias against any kind of intelligence that does not precisely mirror our own. Unless an artificial mind behaves exactly like a human one, we don’t count it as intelligent. Uncover the full diversity of intelligences. Each type of thinking, no matter how large it is scaled up, can only understand in a limited way. The universe is so huge, so vast in its available mysteries, that it will require every possible type of mind to comprehend it. The technium’s job is to invent a million, or a billion, varieties of comprehension. == Science is designed to increase the order and organization of knowledge we generate about the world. Science creates “tools” - techniques and methods - that manipulate information such that it can be tested, compared, recorded, recalled in an orderly fashion, and related to other knowledge. “Truth” is really only a measure of how well specific facts can be built upon, extended, and interconnected. A typical scientific discovery today will rely on facts and a falsifiable hypothesis; be tested in repeatable, controlled experiments, perhaps with placebos and double-blind controls; and be reported in a peer-reviewed journal and indexed in a library of related reports. Technology is how human minds explore the space of possibilities and change the methods of searching for solutions. Technology has brought as much change on this planet in the last 100 years as life has in the last billion years. Popular culture wrongly fixates on proven star roles as the destiny of anyone successful. In fact, those positions of prominence and stardom can be prisons, straitjackets defined by how someone else excelled. Ideally, we would find a position of excellence tailored specifically for everyone born. I’ve learned to seek the minimum amount of technology for myself that will create the maximum amount of choices for myself and others. Always act to increase the number of choices. This principle has never failed: In any game, increase your options. My children: Kaileen, Ting, and Tywen. My wife: Gia-Miin.","Fascinating historical and philosophical perspective on technology, where it's come from, where it's going."
The Power of Habit,Charles Duhigg,1400069289,7,"Habits aren’t destiny, even once they are rooted in our minds. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizational experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function. Once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom - and the responsibility - to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work. “Some thinkers hold that it is by nature that people become good, others that it is by habit, and others that it is by instruction.” For Aristotle, habits reigned supreme. The behaviors that occur unthinkingly are the evidence of our truest selves, he said. So “just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand if it is to nourish the seed, so the mind of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and dislike the right things.” Water is the most apt analogy for how a habit works. Water hollows out for itself a channel, which grows broader and deeper; and, after having ceased to flow, it resumes, when it flows again, the path traced by itself before. Her self-pity gave way. She needed a goal in her life. Something to work toward. Over the next six months, she would replace smoking with jogging, and that, in turn, changed how she ate, worked, slept, saved money, scheduled her workdays, planned for the future, and so on. It wasn’t the trip to Cairo that had caused the shift, scientists were convinced, or the divorce or desert trek. It was that Lisa had focused on changing just one habit - smoking - at first. Everyone in the study had gone through a similar process. By focusing on one pattern - what is known as a “keystone habit” - Lisa had taught herself how to reprogram the other routines in her life, as well. Habits as they are technically defined: the choices that all of us deliberately make at some point, and then stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day. At one point, we all consciously decided how much to eat and what to focus on when we got to the office, how often to have a drink or when to go for a jog. Then we stopped making a choice, and the behavior became automatic. It’s a natural consequence of our neurology. And by understanding how it happens, you can rebuild those patterns in whichever way you choose. A community is a giant collection of habits occurring among thousands of people. You want to fall asleep fast and wake up feeling good? Pay attention to your nighttime patterns and what you automatically do when you get up. You want to make running easy? Create triggers to make it a routine. The brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down. A three-step loop: 1. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. 2. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. 3. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future THE HABIT LOOP Over time, this loop - cue, routine, reward; cue, routine, reward - becomes more and more automatic. The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges. When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. So unless you deliberately fight a habit - unless you find new routines - the pattern will unfold automatically. It’s possible to learn and make unconscious choices without remembering anything about the lesson or decision making. Every McDonald’s looks the same - the company deliberately tries to standardize stores’ architecture and what employees say to customers, so everything is a consistent cue to trigger eating routines. First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards. People who have successfully started new exercise routines show they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they choose a specific cue, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer or an evening of guilt-free television. Why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings. Most of the time, these cravings emerge so gradually that we’re not really aware they exist, so we’re often blind to their influence. But as we associate cues with certain rewards, a subconscious craving emerges in our brains that starts the habit loop spinning. This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop. There are mechanisms that can help us ignore the temptations. But to overpower the habit, we must recognize which craving is driving the behavior. Why people habitually exercise: “accomplishment” - they had come to crave a regular sense of triumph from tracking their performances, and that self-reward was enough to make the physical activity into a habit. If you want to start running each morning, it’s essential that you choose a simple cue (like always lacing up your sneakers before breakfast or leaving your running clothes next to your bed) and a clear reward (such as a midday treat, a sense of accomplishment from recording your miles, or the endorphin rush you get from a jog). But countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren’t enough for a new habit to last. Only when your brain starts expecting the reward - craving the endorphins or sense of accomplishment - will it become automatic to lace up your jogging shoes each morning. The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come. No one craves scentlessness. Lots of people crave a nice smell after they’ve spent thirty minutes cleaning. Consumers need some kind of signal that a product is working. The tingling doesn’t make the toothpaste work any better. It just convinces people it’s doing the job. “Foaming is a huge reward. Shampoo doesn’t have to foam, but we add foaming chemicals because people expect it. Same thing with laundry detergent. And toothpaste.” Use this basic formula to create habits: Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel. Anticipate the reward. That craving will make it easier to push through the gym doors every day. Most of the successful dieters also envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet - a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale each day - something they chose carefully and really wanted. They focused on the craving for that reward. Their cravings for that reward, researchers found, crowded out the temptation to drop the diet. The craving drove the habit loop. Dabbing a bit of sunscreen on your face each morning significantly lowers the odds of skin cancer. Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier. Football : The key to winning was changing players’ habits. He wanted to get players to stop making so many decisions during a game, he said. He wanted them to react automatically, habitually. If he could instill the right habits, his team would win. Period. “Champions don’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would explain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.” Habits are a three-step loop - the cue, the routine, and the reward - but Dungy only wanted to attack the middle step, the routine. He knew from experience that it was easier to convince someone to adopt a new behavior if there was something familiar at the beginning and end. You can never truly extinguish bad habits. Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. That’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same. AA asks alcoholics to search for the rewards they get from alcohol. What cravings, the program asks, are driving your habit loop? Often, intoxication itself doesn’t make the list. Alcoholics crave a drink because it offers escape, relaxation, companionship, the blunting of anxieties, and an opportunity for emotional release. They might crave a cocktail to forget their worries. But they don’t necessarily crave feeling drunk. The physical effects of alcohol are often one of the least rewarding parts of drinking for addicts. Asking patients to describe what triggers their habitual behavior is called awareness training, and like AA’s insistence on forcing alcoholics to recognize their cues, it’s the first step in habit reversal training. Most people’s habits have occurred for so long they don’t pay attention to what causes it anymore. It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it. Say you want to stop snacking at work. Is the reward you’re seeking to satisfy your hunger? Or is it to interrupt boredom? For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group. If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people. A physical addiction to nicotine, for instance, lasts only as long as the chemical is in a smoker’s bloodstream - about one hundred hours after the last cigarette. Many of the lingering urges that we think of as nicotine’s addictive twinges are really behavioral habits asserting themselves - we crave a cigarette at breakfast a month later not because we physically need it, but because we remember so fondly the rush it once provided each morning. Attacking the behaviors we think of as addictions by modifying the habits surrounding them has been shown, in clinical studies, to be one of the most effective modes of treatment. THE FRAMEWORK: • Identify the routine • Experiment with rewards • Isolate the cue • Have a plan How do you start diagnosing and then changing this behavior? By figuring out the habit loop. And the first step is to identify the routine. with most habits - the routine is the most obvious aspect: It’s the behavior you want to change. Next, some less obvious questions: What’s the cue for this routine? Is it hunger? Boredom? Low blood sugar? That you need a break before plunging into another task? And what’s the reward? The cookie itself? The change of scenery? The temporary distraction? Socializing with colleagues? Or the burst of energy that comes from that blast of sugar? To figure this out, you’ll need to do a little experimentation. Rewards are powerful because they satisfy cravings. But we’re often not conscious of the cravings that drive our behaviors. Test different hypotheses to determine which craving is driving your routine. As you test four or five different rewards, you can use an old trick to look for patterns: After each activity, jot down on a piece of paper the first three things that come to mind when you get back to your desk. Then, set an alarm on your watch or computer for fifteen minutes. When it goes off, ask yourself: Do you still feel the urge for that cookie? The reason why it’s important to write down three things - even if they are meaningless words - is twofold. First, it forces a momentary awareness of what you are thinking or feeling. Force her into awareness of her habitual urges, so writing three words forces a moment of attention. What’s more, studies show that writing down a few words helps in later recalling what you were thinking at that moment. At the end of the experiment, when you review your notes, it will be much easier to remember what you were thinking and feeling at that precise instant, because your scribbled words will trigger a wave of recollection. And why the fifteen-minute alarm? Because the point of these tests is to determine the reward you’re craving. If, fifteen minutes after eating a donut, you still feel an urge to get up and go to the cafeteria, then your habit isn’t motivated by a sugar craving. If, after gossiping at a colleague’s desk, you still want a cookie, then the need for human contact isn’t what’s driving your behavior. By experimenting with different rewards, you can isolate what you are actually craving, which is essential in redesigning the habit. The reason why it is so hard to identify the cues that trigger our habits is because there is too much information bombarding us as our behaviors unfold. To identify a cue amid the noise, we can use the same system as the psychologist: Identify categories of behaviors ahead of time to scrutinize in order to see patterns. Luckily, science offers some help in this regard. Experiments have shown that almost all habitual cues fit into one of five categories: Location Time Emotional state Other people Immediately preceding action To re-engineer that formula, we need to begin making choices again. And the easiest way to do this, according to study after study, is to have a plan. Within psychology, these plans are known as “implementation intentions.”","Great dissection and analysis of what creates habits, and the power of changing just one of three steps in the habit loop."
The Passionate Programmer,Chad Fowler,1934356344,7,"The stuff you read in this book? Act on It! Always try to be the worst musician in the band. Find a “be the worst” situation for yourself. The addition of Smalltalk to the requirements list yielded a candidate pool that was tiny in contrast to our previous list. These people were diamonds in the rough. They loved to program! People say, “I haven’t been given the opportunity to work on that” Given the opportunity? Neither was I! I took the opportunity to learn. Ask old-timers to review your code and make suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct. Try a small project, twice. Try it once in your home base technology and then once, as idiomatically as possible, in a competing technology. Programming: I was addicted, but in a good way. My drive to create had been ignited in much the same way that it had when I started writing classical music or playing improvisational jazz. I was obsessed with learning anything and everything I could. I wasn’t in this for a new career. In fact, many of my musician friends thought of it as an irresponsible distraction from my actual career. I was in it because I couldn’t not be. This was the difference between me and my overeducated, underperforming colleagues at work. Passion. The greats in various fields, this same pattern of addictive, passionate behavior surfaces. Jazz saxophone great John Coltrane reportedly practiced so much that his lips would bleed. Letting the (automated) wizards have their way leaves your knowledge shallow and leaves you limited to what the wizards can already do for you. One body of knowledge is neither technical nor domain-specific and won’t be outdated at any time soon: the basics of business finance. A mentor is someone you can trust enough to ask, “What should be different about me as a professional?” Not only do you create a personal attachment and responsibility to your mentor, but the reverse happens as well. If my role in a relationship is to help someone, I become invested in that person’s success. Nobody has to explicitly ask someone to be their mentor. Your mentor may not even know they are serving that role for you. Think of the person in your field whom you admire most. List the ten most important attributes of this role model. Choose the attributes that are the reason why you have chosen this person to be your role model. Rank those qualities in order of importance. You have now created and distilled a list of attributes that you find admirable and important. These are the ways in which you should strive to emulate your chosen role model. For each item on the list, imagine how your role model would rate you on a scale of 1 to 10 Subtract your rating in each row from the importance level you gave it. That gives you a final priority score Martin Fowler said that whenever he wants to really learn about something, he writes about it. To really learn something, try teaching it to someone else. There’s no better way to crystallize your understanding of something than to force yourself to express it to someone else so that they can understand it. We internally work through the reasons why one analogy seems to work but doesn’t and another analogy would seem not to work but does. When you teach, you have to answer questions that may have never occurred to you. Helping someone is a job you can’t be laid off from. When you practice music, it shouldn’t sound good. If you always sound good during practice sessions, it means you’re not stretching your limits. That’s what practice is for. Can you imagine a professional musician getting onstage and replicating the gibberish from my university’s practice rooms? It wouldn’t be tolerated. Musicians are paid to perform in public - not to practice. I started experimenting with programming exercises modeled after my musical practice sessions. Rule number one was that the software I was developing couldn’t be something I wanted to use. I didn’t want to cut corners, rushing to an end goal. So, I wrote software that wasn’t useful. I cut no corners but was frustrated to find that a lot of the ideas I had while practicing weren’t working. Though I was trying to do as good a job as possible, the designs and code I was creating weren’t as elegant as I had hoped they’d be. Looking back on it now, I see that the awkward feeling I got from these experiences was a good sign. My code wasn’t completely devoid of brilliant moments. But I was stretching my mental muscles and building my coding chops. Practice at your limits. Are there dusty corners of your primary programming language that you rarely visit? - Regular expressions are extremely powerful and tragically underutilized. - Multithreaded programming - stream libraries - network programming APIs - utilities available for dealing with collections or lists? Got any favorite pieces of open source software? How about trying to add a feature? Go look at the to-do list for a piece of software you’d like to practice with, and give yourself a constrained amount of time to implement the new feature. Sight reading: download the source code for the software, and start exploring. How do you know where to look? What tricks do you use to find your way around a significant body of code? This is an exercise you can practice often and in short periods of time. You don’t actually have to implement the feature. Just use it as a starting point. The real goal is to understand what you’re looking at as quickly as possible. Be sure to vary the software you work with. Try different types of software in different styles and languages. Take note of issues that make it easier or harder for you to find your way around. What patterns are you developing that help you work through the code? What virtual bread crumbs do you leave for yourself to help you navigate as you move up and down the call stack of a complex piece of functionality? A great way to sharpen the mind and improve your improvisational coding skills is to practice with self-imposed constraints. Pick a simple program, and try to write it with these constraints. My favorite exercise is to write a program that prints the lyrics to the tired old song “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.“ How could you write such a program without doing any variable assignments? How fast can you code this program? How about practicing small, difficult problems with a timer? TopCoder - TopCoder.com offers a practice room with a large collection of practice problems Code Kata, which are small, thought-provoking exercises that programmers can do in the language of their choice. Each kata emphasizes a specific technique or thought process, providing a concrete flexing of one’s mental muscles. Work through all twenty-one kata. Listening to music, therefore, is not a passive activity for a jazz musician. It is study. Furthermore, the ability to understand what you’re hearing is a skill that you develop over time. Studying the work of masters is an essential part of becoming a master. How do others strategically use variable, function, and structure naming? There is no hidden source code for a painting or a piece of music. If you can hear the music or see the piece of art, you can learn from it. As you look at this code with a critical eye, you will start to develop your own tastes, just as you would for music, art, or literature. Various styles and devices will amuse you, amaze you, anger you, and (I hope) challenge you. You will learn more about what already exists. Pick a project, and read it like a book. Make notes. Outline the good and the bad. Write a critique, and publish it. Find at least one trick or pattern that you can use from it. Find at least one bad thing that you observed that you will add to your “What not to do” checklist. “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” The sad thing is that even when you don’t want it to be this way, you can fall into the trap, especially when there are tasks you don’t really want to do. In the case of a weekend coding race, you don’t have time to put tasks off, so you don’t. You can’t delay making a decision, so you don’t. You can’t avoid the boring work, and you know that you have to do it so quickly that nothing can get too boring. A sense of urgency, even if manufactured, is enough to easily double or triple your productivity. Try it, and you’ll see. You can do it faster. You can do it now. You can get it done instead of talking about getting it done. If you treat your projects like a race, you’ll get to the end a lot faster. He had this uncanny ability to predict what you were going to ask him to do and do it before you thought of it. It was like magic. He was only doing things that I had already said I wanted. I had just said them in ways that were subtle enough that even I didn’t realize I had said them. Mind reading not only applies to your managers but also to your customers. If they’re giving you the right cues, you might be able to add features that they’re either going to ask for or would have asked for if they had realized they were possible. Start making some notes about what you think your users and managers are going to ask for. Be creative. Try to see the system from their points of view. Keeping your mind focused on the present will get you further toward your goals than keeping your mind focused on the goal. If you’re always walking around with your head in the clouds, You’ll always be waiting for the big one while ignoring the little things that happen every day. What if you tried to do the boring stuff perfectly? The more successful you are, the more likely you are to make a fatal mistake. When you’ve got everything going for you, you’re less likely to question your own judgment. When the way you’ve always done it has always worked, you’re less likely to recognize a new way that might work better. Software developers are typically creative, freedom-loving people. Martin renamed forty-hour workweek to “eight-hour burn.” The idea is that you should work so relentlessly that there is no way that you could continue longer than eight hours. When you have too much time to work, your work time reduces significantly in perceived value. If you have seventy hours available, each hour is less precious to you than when you have forty hours available. Eight-hour burn places a constraint on you and gives you a strategy for dealing with that constraint. You get to work and think, I’ve only got eight hours! Go, go, go! If you work intensely every day, you’ll find that the work doesn’t follow you home. Not only are you deliberately stopping yourself from working after-hours, but your mind will actually allow you to stop working after-hours. Every wrong note is at most one step away from a right one. What makes improvisations bad is when the improviser doesn’t know what to do when the wrong note pops out. “I don’t know” is not a phrase for the insecure. Heroes never panic. Chris would actually plan down to how he was going to use the fifteen minutes between classes to fit in practice routines that could be done quickly. You should read good code. You have to actively copy, widely and unashamedly. This applies to a lot of things, of course. Hunter S. Thompson didn’t just read good books; he typed out Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Copying builds muscle memory. You get a feel for the nuance and form of the original - the kind of detail that’s lost in a quick scan. Don’t let yourself just be the best in the bunch. Be the person and do the things that people can’t not talk about. He was just a high-school kid. But, he was already playing gigs, substituting for Little Rock’s most respected jazz pianists. Chris was pretty good - especially for his age - but he wasn’t that good. It didn’t take me long to understand what was happening. When the band we were watching took a set break, Chris would break mid-sentence and just walk away from me to go talk to the band members. He was pushy as hell and would always ask if he could sit in with the band, no matter how inappropriate it seemed to me. He would also ask the musicians for lessons, which meant that he would go to their houses, listen to music, and chat about jazz improvisation with them. I’ve seen the same pattern in people I’ve met in classical music, the American Tibetan Buddhist community, software development. Really good people won’t mind if you want to know them. People like to be appreciated, and they like to talk about the topics they are passionate about. The fact that they are the professional or the guru or the leader or the renowned author doesn’t change that they’re human and like to interact with other humans. The gurus are the supernodes in the social and professional network. All it takes to make the connection is a little less humility. Carve out weekly time to investigate the bleeding edge. Research new technologies and to start to develop skills in them. Do hands-on work with these new technologies. Watch the alpha geeks. Rigid values make you fragile. The big problems I have successfully solved in my life. The secret is to focus on making whatever it is you’re trying to improve better today than it was yesterday. That’s it. It’s easy.","Wonderful book about the art, craft, and passion of being a great computer programmer.

Fail-Safe Investing,Harry Browne,031226321X,7,"The 17 Simple Rules of Financial Safety RULE #1 BUILD YOUR WEALTH UPON YOUR CAREER Most part-time investors who try to beat the markets lose part or all of the savings they've worked so hard to accumulate. Can you make big profits by relying on an expert who does have the proper qualifications? How do you identify a true expert? That task is no easier than picking the right investments. If you don't understand investing as well as the pros, you won't know how to evaluate those who seek to advise you. And you can't rely on an advisor's track record, even when it's presented honestly. Track records tell you only how advisors did in the past - not how they will do next year. You're violating Rule #1 if you think your investments can be the sole source of your retirement wealth - or if you steal time from your work to manage your investments - or if you think about abandoning your job to become a full-time investor. RULE #2 DON'T ASSUME YOU CAN REPLACE YOUR WEALTH You earned your wealth because your talent and effort harmonized with the circumstances in which you found yourself. But the world won't stand still for you or repeat itself when you need it to. So assume that what you have now is irreplaceable, that you could never earn it again - even if you suspect you could. Say “No!” to any proposition that asks you to risk losing it. RULE #3 RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVESTING AND SPECULATING When you invest, you accept whatever return the markets are paying investors in general. When you speculate, you attempt to beat that return. You're speculating when: * You select individual stocks, mutual funds, or stock market sectors you believe will do better than the market as a whole. * You move your capital in and out of markets according to how well you think they'll perform in the near future. * You base your investments on current prospects for the nation's economy. * You use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, cyclical analysis, or any other form of analysis or system to tell you when to buy and sell. RULE #4 BEWARE OF FORTUNE-TELLERS As with the rest of your life, safety doesn't come from trying to peer into the future to eliminate uncertainty. Safety comes from devising realistic ways to deal with uncertainty. We live in an uncertain world - and that no one can eliminate the uncertainty for you. Look for ways to assure that the uncertain future won't hurt you - no matter what it turns out to be. RULE #5 DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO MAKE YOU RICH The Helper (accountant, etc) is worth listening to. He or she can acquaint you with investment alternatives you weren't aware of, and that might be a good fit for you. He can teach you the mechanics and procedures for getting things done in the investment world. He can raise the questions you need to answer in order to devise a portfolio that suits your needs. He can help you reduce the tax bill on your investment profits. You don't act on the advice of someone you never heard of. And you hear of him only after - and because - he has made several profitable recommendations in a row. The investment expert with the perfect record up to now will lose his touch as soon as you start acting on his advice. RULE #6 DON'T EXPECT A TRADING SYSTEM TO MAKE YOU RICH Trading systems generally arise from one of two sources. The first source is a commonsense observation about human behavior - which someone then tries to transform into a quantifiable, mechanical system. For example, Contrary Opinion is a theory that says, among other things, that an investment is likely to be near its peak when everyone seems to know how good its prospects are. The idea makes some sense. If everyone already knows something is a good investment, most people who are likely to buy it probably already have done so - leaving very few investors to buy it and push its price still higher. In such a case, you should be skeptical about its prospects as a speculation. But that doesn't mean we know precisely when or at what price the investment will peak. You know only that there doesn't seem to be room for the price to go much higher. But people who devise trading systems aren't satisfied with anything so indefinite. They devise indicators to measure the precise degree of bullishness and bearishness surrounding a specific investment - and then construct formulas that provide specific signals for buying and selling. This is similar to taking an obvious truth - such as that attendance at sporting events is generally smaller on rainy days than on sunny days - and constructing a formula that supposedly translates the number of inches of rainfall into an exact forecast of the attendance. Trading systems are based on the unstated assumption that the world doesn't change. But the world is in constant change - as desires change, demand changes, and supplies change. RULE #7 INVEST ONLY ON A CASH BASIS When someone goes completely broke, it's almost always because he was operating with borrowed money. RULE #8 MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS Many individuals have lost their fortunes because they gave someone (usually a financial advisor or attorney) the authority to make their decisions and handle their money. Even when there is no wrongdoing, no advisor can be expected to treat your wealth with the same respect you give to it. You don't need a money manager. Investing is complicated and difficult only if you're trying to speculate and beat the market. Above all, never give anyone signature authority over money that's precious to you. RULE #9 DO ONLY WHAT YOU UNDERSTAND RULE #10 SPREAD THE RISK No one investment is good for all times. You can't rely on any institution to protect your wealth for you. Old-line banks have failed, pension funds have come under a cloud of suspicion, and scandals - both real and imagined - are common on Wall Street. The company you depend on to keep your wealth may no longer be there when you're ready to withdraw your life savings. Diversify across investments and institutions - and keep things simple enough to manage yourself - you can relax, knowing that no one event can do you in. RULE #11 BUILD A BULLETPROOF PORTFOLIO FOR PROTECTION The portfolio should assure that your wealth will survive any event - including events that would be devastating to any one investment. Three absolute requirements for such a portfolio are: 1. Safety: It should protect you against every possible economic future. You should profit during times of normal prosperity, but you also should be safe (and perhaps even profit) during bad times - inflation, recession, or even depression. 2. Stability: Whatever economic climate arrives, the portfolio's performance should be so steady that you won't wonder whether the portfolio needs to be changed. Even in the worst possible circumstances, the portfolio's value should drop no more than slightly - so that you won't panic and abandon it. This stability also permits you to turn your attention away from your investments, confident that your portfolio will protect you in any circumstance. 3. Simplicity: The portfolio should be so easy to maintain, and require so little of your time, that you'll never be tempted to look for something that seems simpler, but is less safe. You leave it alone - to hold the same investments, in the same proportions, permanently. You don't change the proportions as you, your friends, or investment gurus change their minds about the future. Your portfolio needs to respond well only to those broad movements. And they fit into four general categories: 1. Prosperity: A period during which living standards are rising, the economy is growing, business is thriving, interest rates usually are falling, and unemployment is declining. 2. Inflation: A period when consumer prices generally are rising. They might be rising moderately (an inflation rate of 6% or so), rapidly (10% to 20% or so, as in the late 1970s), or at a runaway rate (25% or more). 3. Tight money or recession: A period during which the growth of the supply of money in circulation slows down. This leaves people with less cash than they expected to have, and usually leads to a recession - a period of poor economic conditions. 4. Deflation: The opposite of inflation. Consumer prices decline and the purchasing power value of money grows. In the past, deflation has sometimes triggered a depression - a prolonged period of very bad economic conditions, as in the 1930s. Investment prices can be affected by what happens outside the financial system - wars, changes in government policies, new tax rules, civil turmoil, and other matters. But these events have a lasting effect on investments only if they push the economy from one to another of the four environments I've just described. The four economic categories are all-inclusive. At any time, one of them will predominate. So if you're protected in these four situations, you're protected in all situations. Thus four investments provide coverage for all four economic environments: STOCKS take advantage of prosperity. They tend to do poorly during periods of inflation, deflation, and tight money, but over time those periods don't undo the gains that stocks achieve during periods of prosperity. BONDS also take advantage of prosperity. In addition, they profit when interest rates collapse during a deflation. You should expect bonds to do poorly during times of inflation and tight money. GOLD not only does well during times of intense inflation, it does very well. In the 1970s, gold rose twenty times over as the inflation rate soared to its peak of 15% in 1980. Gold generally does poorly during times of prosperity, tight money, and deflation. CASH is most profitable during a period of tight money. Not only is it a liquid asset that can give you purchasing power when your income and investments might be ailing, but the rise in interest rates increases the return on your dollars. Cash also becomes more valuable during a deflation as prices fall. Cash is essentially neutral during a time of prosperity, and it is a loser during times of inflation. Any attempt to be clever in assigning portions to the investments probably will do more harm than good. I prefer the simplicity of allocating 25% to each of the four investments. The only maintenance required is to check the portfolio's makeup once a year. If any of the four investments has become worth less than 15%, or more than 35%, of the portfolio's overall value, you need to restore the original percentages. When you make your once-a-year check of the portfolio's value, if all four investments are within the 15-35% range, no rebalancing is necessary. During the year, if you happen to notice that there's been a big change in investment prices, you may want to check the values of the investments. Again, if any investment has strayed outside the 15-35% range, go ahead and rebalance the entire portfolio. The test of a Permanent Portfolio is whether it provides peace of mind. A Permanent Portfolio should let you watch the evening news or read investment publications in total serenity. No actual or threatened event should trouble you, because you'll know that your portfolio is protected against it. If someone warns about the “alarming parallels” between the current decade and the 1920s, you shouldn't wonder whether you need to sell all your stocks. You'll know that your Permanent Portfolio will take care of you - even if next year turns out to be 1929 revisited. The deflation that could devastate stocks would push interest rates downward and bring big profits for your bonds. When someone claims the inflation rate is headed back to 15%, you shouldn't wonder whether to dump all your bonds. You'll know that the gain in your Permanent Portfolio's gold would far outweigh any losses on the bonds. When someone announces that a new debt crisis is on the way, or that a bull market is about to begin in stocks, bonds, or gold, you won't feel pressured to decide whether he's right. You'll know that the Permanent Portfolio will respond favorably to any eventuality. I can't list every potential event. So if you become concerned by any possibility, reread this chapter and you should be reassured that there's an investment in your Permanent Portfolio that will cover you if the worst should occur. Whatever the potential crisis or opportunity, your Permanent Portfolio should already be taking care of you. The portfolio can't guarantee a profit every year; no portfolio can. It won't outperform the hotshot advisor in his best year. And it won't outperform the best investment of the year. But it can give you the confidence that no crisis will destroy you, the assurance that your savings are secure and growing in all circumstances, and the knowledge that you're no longer vulnerable to the mistakes in judgment that you or the best advisor could so easily make. RULE #12 SPECULATE ONLY WITH MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE RULE #13 KEEP SOME ASSETS OUTSIDE YOUR OWN COUNTRY For complete safety, don't allow everything you own to be within the reach of your government. If you keep some assets in a different country, you'll be less vulnerable, and you'll feel less vulnerable. You won't have to worry so much about what your government might do next. Keeping some investments abroad provides safe and easy protection against surprises that might happen anywhere - confiscation of gold holdings by the government, exchange controls, civil disorder, even war. No one knows how the people elected in the coming years might choose to solve the economic problems the country will face. It might strike them that the quick and easy solution is to take your property - as has happened so often already. Your assets will be safe even if war, civil disorder, a weakening of law enforcement, or a physical catastrophe should disrupt record-keeping in your own country. Your entire estate will no longer be vulnerable to economic, political, or legal setbacks in your own country. Geographic diversification is a necessary part of making sure the Permanent Portfolio can handle whatever hazard materializes. RULE #14 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TAX-REDUCTION PLANS Tax deferral: the basic method for reducing the tax burden on your investment program. With tax deferral, the money you don't pay in taxes today can work to produce more earnings every year until you finally have to pay the tax. RULE #15 ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS In what economic circumstances is the investment's price likely to go down? Are other investments in your portfolio likely to take up the slack by gaining in those same circumstances? Under what circumstances could I lose a substantial share - 20% or more - of my investment? Under what circumstances could my entire investment be lost? Would I have any residual liability - that is, can I lose even more than the cash I invested? Interest rates generally reflect an investment's risk. A higher interest rate means there's a greater possibility the capital can be lost - through default or inflation. Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to appreciate? Under what circumstances, if any, is the investment likely to depreciate? In good circumstances for the investment, will the overall return - yield plus capital appreciation - help your portfolio overcome losses in other investments? If the investment is a mutual fund, you want the fund with the lowest yield - other things being equal. Any dividend paid by a mutual fund simply reduces the price of your shares ""Is this company a potential takeover candidate?” The crowd isn't always wrong, but you can't make much betting with it - because you will buy at a price that's already high. By going against the crowd, you buy when an investment is out of favor and cheap; if it does succeed, there's a long way for it to go up. So the most important factor in speculating is whether you expect something that most people don't expect. For example, the time to consider buying inflation hedges speculatively is when most people believe inflation is under control. The time to consider buying a particular company is when everyone knows what a dog it is - not when everyone talks about its great promise. Unpopularity doesn't guarantee profits, but you'll never make a killing with a popular investment. “Do the technical factors favor the investment now?"" You must have an investment plan. Without a plan, you will be tossed and turned by all the conflicting ideas you read and hear- - and you'll never ask the right questions. With a plan, you'll have a basis for evaluating whatever you hear. You'll know to ask the questions that help you determine whether an investment furthers your plan. RULE #16 ENJOY YOURSELF WITH A BUDGET FOR PLEASURE Budget a sum of money that you can spend each year without concern for the consequences. If you stay within that amount, you can feel free to blow the money on cars, trips, anything you want - without worry, because you'll know you aren't blowing your future. RULE #17 WHENEVER YOU'RE IN DOUBT, ERR ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY If you wind up losing something, let it be only an opportunity that was lost - not precious capital. People rarely go broke playing it safe. But many go broke taking great risks or making investments they know too little about. If you're hesitating, it's because you don't yet know enough about the investment or the problem to make a confident decision. That means you shouldn't take the plunge until you know more and you're sure you understand all the ramifications. The premise for speculation is that you're more astute than most other investors - that you understand the market better, that you have information not available to other investors, that you can make better decisions, or that your interpretation of available information is especially perceptive. The elements of speculation are timing, forecasting, trading systems, and selection. Any time you use any of these tactics you're speculating. Investment forecasts can be exciting. But in other areas of our lives, we think of fortune-tellers as entertainers. Forecasts are not entirely useless. Someone's predictions can help you recognize that your own expectations for the future aren't the only possible outcome. This can help keep you humble and prudent. If you come to feel a given event is quite possible but most people disagree with you, the market probably will provide a big payoff if you bet on that event and prove to be right. So if you like to watch the investment markets closely and you see a potential future that most people are ignoring, you may want to make a small speculation with money you can afford to lose. A sure way to lose what you've accumulated is to risk the funds that are precious to you on the idea that some event is inevitable. In 1970, the chief gold trader at the largest Swiss bank told a friend of mine that the gold price would never go above $40. When asked how he could be so sure, the trader replied, “Because we control the market."" “Insiders” are no more help than fortunetellers or high-priced pros. You can protect yourself against the possibility of institutional crisis by using more than one institution. You can protect yourself against the failings of individuals by relying only on yourself. And you can protect yourself against investment roller coasters by diversifying across investment markets. Split the 25% stock-market portion among three mutual funds. For the bond portion, you don't want to have to monitor credit risk, so buy only U.S. Treasury bonds. So long as the U.S. government has the ability to tax people or print money to pay its bills, there is virtually no credit risk. Put the 25% in the Treasury bond issue that currently has the longest time until it matures. That will be close to 30 years. Ten years later, the bond will have only 20 years to maturity; at that time replace it with a new 30-year bond. Buy bullion coins - coins whose only value is the gold bullion they contain. They sell for about 3-5% more per ounce than gold bullion. That means a one-ounce coin will sell for about $310-$315 if the price of gold is $300 an ounce. The cash portion should be kept in a money market fund investing only in short-term U.S. Treasury securities, so that you don't have to evaluate credit risk. These securities are safer than bank accounts and other debt instruments. If your cash budget is large enough, divide your holdings between two or three funds - for further protection against the unthinkable. The value of real estate in your portfolio is indivisible, and everything else must accommodate it. Just like a 15-foot piano in the living room, you have to arrange the rest of the furniture around it. Your house is a consumption item - the place where you live and enjoy your life. Don't play games with your Permanent Portfolio. Don't wait for any investment to become cheaper before you buy it. And don't go overboard investing in something that happens to be doing well now. Just put 25% in each of the four categories. No matter how strong your expectations about the near future, you could easily be mistaken. And the point of the Permanent Portfolio is to ignore your own expectations and let the portfolio take care of you no matter what may come. Fund it with equal portions of all four investments and don't worry over which is going to do best. It is a package of investments that provides the safety you need. Tear apart the package and you tear apart the safety. A foreign account in any country outside your own is a tremendous improvement over having everything in your home country. But some countries are more hospitable than others. And some have legal traditions that protect your privacy. I've always been partial to Switzerland and Austria, because each has a centuries-old tradition of respecting privacy and fending off inquiries from other governments. If you buy and hold gold through the foreign bank, the gold most likely will be stored within the bank itself. The secret - that things rarely work out as expected - is shared unwittingly by investors, brokers, advisors, newsletter writers, and financial journalists, few of whom can bring themselves to acknowledge it. Each wants to appear to be in command of the situation, on top of the markets, aware of what's happening and what's going to happen - and to appear as though everything that has already happened was anticipated. A professional needs to keep up this guise because he must look sharper than his competitors. Even investors often pose as members of the all-knowing - perhaps because no one wants to appear to be the only loser, and everyone else seems to be so smart. When you give up the search for certainty, an enormous burden is lifted from your shoulders. The less you know - and the more honestly you recognize the limits of your knowledge - the more likely your investment program will turn out okay. Humility is accepting that you don't know everything, or even everything about any particular topic, and it is an investor's most vital asset. Arrogance eventually ruins any investor.","Its main point is the “Permanent Portfolio” - a beautiful simple idea to have 25% of your savings each in investments that do well during boom (stocks), bust (bonds), inflation (gold), deflation (cash). Then just rebalance when they get too far out of 25% each. No predicting the future. No worrying about the news. Just 25% each and rebalance."
Poke the Box,Seth Godin,1936719002,7,"1. be aware of the market, of opportunities, of who you are. 2. be educated, so you can understand what’s around you. 3. be connected, so you can be trusted as you engage. 4. be consistent, so the system knows what to expect. 5. build an asset, so you have something to sell. 6. be productive, so you can be well-priced. 7. have the guts and the heart and the passion to ship. **** The challenge is getting into the habit of starting. When we blindly accept what’s given, we lose all power. Only by poking, testing, modifying, and understanding can we truly own anything. No one has influence, control, or confidence in his work until he initiates change. An obsession with changing the status quo merely to see what happens. KINDS OF CAPITAL: - Financial capital: Money in the bank that can be put to work on a project or investment. - Network capital: People you know, connections you can make, retailers and systems you can plug into. - Intellectual capital: Smarts. Software systems. Access to people with insight. - Physical capital: Plant and machinery and tools and trucks. - Prestige capital: Your reputation. - Instigation capital: The desire to move forward. The ability and the guts to say yes. Nobody criticizes worthy failure: good intent, seeking connection and joy and the ability to make a difference. Continue on the initiative path when others fret about “quality” and “predictability,” you will ultimately succeed because you’ll be making a difference and using your newfound leverage to do more and more work that matters. The first rule of doing work that matters: Go to work on a regular basis. Make your schedule before you start. Don’t allow setbacks or blocks or anxiety to push you to take a nap. Isaac Asimov wrote and published more than 400 (!) books by typing nonstop from 6 am to noon, every day for forty years. We love to point out how broken things are, but we rarely look at merely mediocre products and wonder why they aren’t great. Why is this mediocre? Initiative is a little like creativity in that both require curiosity. An insatiable desire to understand how something works and how it might work better. The creative person is satisfied once he sees how it’s done, but the initiator won’t rest until he does it. Entrepreneurs initiate, but also use money to build a profitable business that’s bigger than themselves. The goal of the entrepreneur is to build an entity, something that can grow and thrive once it’s moving. It involves using money, people, and assets to create a new, bigger, entity. Initiative is scarce. Hence: valuable. How often do our heroes stand still? It’s hard to imagine Spock and Kirk landing on a planet and just relaxing for a month or two. Not-allowed lists: The park near my house doesn’t allow dogs, non-residents, or birthday parties. The allowed list is harder to remember and to write down. I think we might be afraid of how much freedom we actually have, and how much we’re expected to do with that freedom. It’s comforting to live with a list of what’s not allowed. We remember it, we push against it, but ultimately, we enjoy the confinement that the limits bring us. When revolutions appear, when the list gets much shorter, it’s surprising how long it takes for us to take action. “Ladies and gentlemen, in the center ring, high above you on the trapeze, they will now attempt a triple flip....” The way he said attempt led us all to believe that this might not work. Attempt. Not perform. Not display. We weren’t there to see the acrobats do something great that they had done again and again. No, we were going to see something new, something risky, something interesting. Yoda was wrong: Yes, there is a try. Try is the opposite of hiding. Starting demands finishing. Starting means you’re going to finish. If it doesn’t ship, you’ve failed. To merely start without finishing is just boasting, or stalling, or a waste of time. In short-term thinking, following the rules, rewarding someone who has done it before is a great way to win. Long-term, though, all you’ve done is taught conformity and punished initiation. You can’t optimize your way to surprising growth. People with credibility and resources are so busy trying to hold onto them that they fail to bring their provocative ideas to the world. What a relief to Bob Dylan when he was booed at the Newport Folk Festival. There, that’s out of the way. Now let’s make some art. Identifying the sophomore slump, the challenge of expectations - writing it down, talking it up, and relentlessly working to destroy it - is the best way to get back to the reason you set out to do whatever it is you do in the first place. Starting something is not an event; it’s a series of events. You decide to walk to Cleveland. So you take a first step in the right direction. That’s starting. You spend the rest of the day walk- ing toward Cleveland, one step at a time, picking your feet up and putting them down. At the end of the day, twenty miles later, you stop at a hotel. And what happens the next morning? Either you quit the project or you start again, walking to Cleveland. In fact, every step is a new beginning. Sure, you’re closer than you were yesterday or last week, but you’re still heading toward Cleveland. Keep starting until you finish. You couldn’t be a star at PARC unless you started something audacious. During a two-year period, they invented the laser printer, the high-resolution screen, the mouse, on-screen windows, and even the frame buffer that led to all special effects in the movies. Every spring, every crack in every pavement is filled with dandelions. That’s the goal: for every crack to be filled with your ideas and innovations and creativity. The only way to achieve this is to be prepared for many of them to fail, to land on pavement, to be perfect yet cease to grow. We can cry about these failures, but that will lead us to hold back on the next idea. Or we can celebrate them, realizing that it’s proof that we’re being promiscuous in our shipping, putting the best work we can into the world, regardless of whether this particular idea actually works. Jay Gatsby: “What would be the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?” It’s easy to fall so in love with the idea of starting that we never actually start. “There are two mistakes one can make along the road to truth. Not going all the way, and not starting.” - Siddhārtha Gautama",Awesome short manifesto about getting into the habit of starting things. Inspiring as hell. Go go go!
The 4-Hour Body,Tim Ferriss,030746363X,7,"The yeoman work in any science is done by the experimentalist, who must keep the theoreticians honest. The minimum effective dose (MED) is defined simply: the smallest dose that will produce a desired outcome. Anything beyond the MED is wasteful. To boil water, the MED is 212°F (100°C) at standard air pressure. Boiled is boiled. Higher temperatures will not make it more boiled. If you need 15 minutes in the sun to trigger a melanin response, 15 minutes is your MED for tanning. More than 15 minutes is redundant and will just result in burning and a forced break from the beach. Two fundamental MEDs to keep in mind: 1. To remove stored fat, do the least necessary to trigger a fat-loss cascade of specific hormones. 2. To add muscle, do the least necessary to trigger local (specific muscles) and systemic (hormonal) growth mechanisms. Besides whole foods, anything you put in your mouth or your bloodstream that has an effect is a drug. Treat them all as such. It’s not what you put in your mouth that matters, it’s what makes it to your bloodstream. If it passes through, it doesn’t count. The decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit. Exercise in our context, however, is the application of measurable stimuli to decrease fat, increase muscle, or increase performance. Recreation is for fun. Exercise is for producing changes. Don’t confuse the two. Ask when faced with advice or sales pitches is: “If this [method/product/diet/etc.] didn’t work as advertised, what might their other incentives be for selling it?” Aerobics classes? The reason you’re sold: aerobics is more effective than alternative X. The real reason it’s promoted: there’s no equipment investment and the gym can maximize students per square foot per class. Many “new and improved” recommendations are based on calculating profit first and then working backward to justify it. To earn a fortune in the diet and exercise industries, there is a dictum: complicate to profit. The artificial separation of aerobic and anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism might be useful for selling aerobics, a marketing term popularized by Dr. Kenneth Cooper in 1968, but it’s not a reflection of reality. “I just want to be healthy” is not actionable. Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance.… It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves. - Mahatma Put together an exact meal plan for just ONE week, buy all the ingredients, stick to it religiously. From that point on, I didn’t have to do the hard work anymore. I became aware after just one week of roughly how many calories were in a portion of different types of food and just guessed. Chad: Recumbent bike while working. Got a heart rate monitor (HRM) and started using it for EVERYTHING. Estimate your bodyfat (BF%) Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which costs $50–100 per session, ended up my favorite, as it is repeatable and offers valuable information besides bodyfat percentage. BodyMetrix is a hand-held ultrasound device that tells you the exact thickness of fat (in millimeters) wherever you place it. Immediately upon waking, drink 1.5 liters (about 50 fluid ounces) of cold water - ensure that water temperature is the same day to day - and wait 30 minutes. Urinate and then test bodyfat using bio-impedance. Do not eat or drink anything else before testing. Starting a body recomposition program without measurements is like planning a trip without a start address. I guarantee you will regret it later. Making yourself injury-proof requires, above all, correcting left-right imbalances. Get a simple tape measure and measure four locations: 1. both upper arms (mid-bicep) 2. waist (horizontal at navel) 3. hips (at widest point below waist) 4. both legs (mid-thigh) Total these numbers to arrive at your Total Inches (TI). Four principles of failure-proofing behavior. Think of them as insurance against the weaknesses of human nature - your weaknesses, my weaknesses, our weaknesses: 1. Make it conscious 2. Make it a game 3. Make it competitive 4. Make it small and temporary Photograph all meals or snacks prior to eating. Subjects who use food diaries lose three times as much weight as those who don’t. Take digital photos of yourself from the front, back, and side. Wear either underwear or a bathing suit. Put the least flattering “before” photo somewhere you will see it often. Those who experienced the most dramatic changes credited the “before” photographs with adherence to the program. Measurement = motivation. Seeing progress in changing numbers makes the repetitive fascinating and creates a positive feedback loop. Need to find someone to keep you accountable? To encourage or harass you when needed? BodySpace (www.bodybuilding.com/superhuman) or DailyBurn (www.dailyburn.com/superhuman) Example at www.fourhourbody.com/phil. Just input your starting weight and desired ending weight, and you can duplicate his experiment. We are what we do repeatedly. Set a meager goal of two pages of writing per day. If you want to walk an hour a day, don’t start with one hour. Choosing one hour is automatically building in the excuse of not having enough time. Commit to a fail-proof five minutes instead. RULE #1: AVOID WHITE CARBOHYDRATES All bread, rice (including brown), cereal, potatoes, pasta, tortillas, and fried food with breading. RULE #2: EAT THE SAME FEW MEALS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Proteins *Egg whites with 1–2 whole eggs for flavor (or, if organic, 2–5 whole eggs, including yolks) *Chicken breast or thigh *Beef (preferably grass-fed) *Fish Pork Legumes *Lentils (also called “dal” or “daal”) *Black beans Pinto beans Red beans Soybeans Vegetables *Spinach *Mixed vegetables (including broccoli, cauliflower, or any other cruciferous vegetables) *Sauerkraut, kimchee (full explanation of these later in “Damage Control”) Asparagus Peas Broccoli Green beans Eat as much as you like of the above food items, but keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Eating more frequent meals also appears to have no enhancing effect on resting metabolic rate, despite claims to the contrary. Make sure to have your first meal within an hour of waking. Meals are approximately four hours apart. RULE #3: DON’T DRINK CALORIES Do not drink milk (including soy milk), normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. Limit diet soft drinks to no more than 16 ounces per day if you can, as the aspartame can stimulate weight gain. RULE #4: DON’T EAT FRUIT The only exceptions to the no-fruit rule are tomatoes and avocadoes. Say no to fruit and its principal sugar, fructose, which is converted to glycerol phosphate more efficiently than almost all other carbohydrates. Glycerol phosphate → triglycerides (via the liver) → fat storage. RULE #5: TAKE ONE DAY OFF PER WEEK. Dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat-loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function and conversion of T4 to T3, etc.) doesn’t downshift from extended caloric restriction. That’s right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat. SHOULD I TAKE ANY SUPPLEMENTS? I suggest potassium, magnesium, and calcium. 500 milligrams of magnesium taken prior to bed will also improve sleep. Removing even a little dairy can dramatically accelerate fat-loss. Weigh yourself before your first meal on cheat day and ignore the short-term fluctuations, which do not reflect fat-loss or gain. Macadamia oil is the new and improved olive oil. There should be no need, or real physical urge, to eat snacks. If you are hungry, you’re not eating enough protein and legumes at each meal. DO I REALLY HAVE TO BINGE ONCE A WEEK? It is important to spike caloric intake once per week. This causes a host of hormonal changes that improve fat-loss, from increasing cAMP and GMP to improving conversion of the T4 thyroid hormone to the more active T3. Everyone binges eventually on a diet, and it’s better to schedule it ahead of time to limit the damage. Spinach is incredible for body recomposition. Almost all of my vegetables are either frozen (80%) or canned (20%). CAN I EAT WHOLE GRAINS OR STEEL-CUT OATS? No. I discourage consuming any refined soy products, including all soy milk and isolated soy protein supplements. CAN I EAT FRIED FOODS? Stir-fry is ideal for this diet, as are most cuisines (like Thai) that depend on it. If you’re airport-hopping and cannot find a Mexican restaurant or grill, grab a bag of raw almonds or walnuts at a kiosk and commit to consuming no starch. Most airports also have chicken salads (omit dressings besides olive oil or vinegar) that you can combine with the nuts. If it comes down to it, choose mild hunger instead of deviation. Having followed this diet in 30+ countries, I can state without exception that travel is not a legitimate excuse for breaking the rules. MISTAKE #1: NOT EATING WITHIN ONE HOUR OF WAKING, PREFERABLY WITHIN 30 MINUTES MISTAKE #2: NOT EATING ENOUGH PROTEIN Get at least 20 grams of protein per meal. This is absolutely most critical at breakfast. Eating at least 40% of your breakfast calories as protein will decrease carb impulses and promote a negative fat balance. Even 20% protein - more than most people consume - doesn’t cut it. First choice: down two to three whole eggs at breakfast. Related problem: not eating enough food. Do NOT try to restrict portions or calories. Eat until you are full, and eat as much as you like of the approved foods. If you don’t, you will either downshift your metabolism or cheat between meals with banned-food snacks. Get plenty of legumes. MISTAKE #6: OVEREATING “DOMINO FOODS”: NUTS, CHICKPEAS (GARBANZO BEANS), HUMMUS, PEANUTS, MACADAMIAS There are certain foods that, while technically fine to eat on the diet, are prone to portion abuse. I call these “domino foods,” as eating one portion often creates a domino effect of oversnacking. My fat-loss has plateaued three times due to almonds, which are easy to consume by the handful and simple to excuse as nutritious. Unfortunately, they also contain 824 calories per cup, 146 calories more than a Whopper from Burger King (678 kilocalories). A few almonds is just fine (5–10), but no one eats just a few almonds. Unsustainable overtraining and related “reward” eating: Doing too much will not only not help, it will reverse your progress, as it also leads to overeating, sports drinks, and other assorted self- sabotage. Remember the MED. Less is more. Have as much of the crap ingested either go into muscle tissue or out of the body unabsorbed. I do this by focusing on three principles: PRINCIPLE #1: MINIMIZE THE RELEASE OF INSULIN, A STORAGE HORMONE Insulin release is minimized by blunting sharp jumps in blood sugar: 1. Ensure that your first meal of the day is not a binge meal. Make it high in protein (at least 30 grams) and insoluble fiber (legumes will handle this). The protein will decrease your appetite for the remainder of the binge and prevent total self-destruction. 2. Consume a small quantity of fructose, fruit sugar, in grapefruit juice before the second meal, which is the first crap meal. Even small fructose dosing has an impressive near-flat-lining effect on blood glucose. 3. Use supplements that increase insulin sensitivity: AGG (part of PAGG) and PAGG 4. Consume citric juices, whether lime juice squeezed into water, lemon juice on food, PRINCIPLE #2: INCREASE THE SPEED OF GASTRIC EMPTYING, OR HOW QUICKLY FOOD EXITS THE STOMACH Bingeing is a rare circumstance where I want the food (or some of it) to pass through my gastrointestinal tract so quickly that its constituent parts aren’t absorbed well. I accomplish this primarily through caffeine and yerba mate tea, which includes the additional stimulants theobromine (found in dark chocolate) and theophylline (found in green tea). I consume 100–200 milligrams of caffeine, or 16 ounces of cooled yerba mate, at the most crap-laden meals. PRINCIPLE #3: ENGAGE IN BRIEF MUSCULAR CONTRACTION THROUGHOUT THE BINGE For muscular contractions, my default options are air squats, wall presses (tricep extensions against a wall), and chest pulls with an elastic band, Why the hell would you want to do 60–90 seconds of funny exercises a few minutes before you eat and, ideally, again about 90 minutes afterward? Because it brings glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) to the surface of muscle cells, opening more gates for the calories to flow into. Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) is an indigenous medicinal plant of India. CQ preserved my abs. I saw measurable fat-loss and anabolic effects once I reached 2.4 grams (2,400 milligrams), three times per day 30 minutes prior to meals, for a total of 7.2 grams per day. Super Cissus Rx (www.fourhourbody.com/cq) This is the brand of CQ I used during the experimentation. There are actually 10 times more bacterial cells in your body than human cells: 100 trillion of them to 10 trillion of you. For the most part, these bugs help us, improving our immune system, providing vitamins, and preventing other harmful bacteria from infecting us. Lean people have more Bacteroidetes and fewer Firmicutes; obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes. 12 traditional diets of near-disease-free indigenous communities spread around the globe. He found that the one common element was fermented foods, which were consumed daily. Cultural mainstays varied but included cheese, Japanese natto, kefir, kimchi (also spelled “kimchee”), sauerkraut, and fermented fish. Unsweetened plain yogurt and fermented kombucha tea are two additional choices. Fermented foods contain high levels of healthy bacteria and should be viewed as a mandatory piece of your dietary puzzle. Consider probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are bacteria. I’ve used Sedona Labs iFlora probiotics. I prefer inulin, which I get through the Athletic Greens. Inulin is about 10% the sweetness of sugar, but unlike fructose, it’s not insulinemic. In the whole-foods realm, garlic, leeks, and chicory are all high in inulin Athletic Greens (www.athleticgreens.com) This is my all-in-one greens insurance policy. It contains 76 ingredients, including inulin for improving bacterial balance. Thera-Bands (www.fourhourbody.com/thera) I started doing standing chest pulls with Thera-Bands Mini-bands (www.fourhourbody.com/minibands) I now use these for standing band pulls. PAGG. Policosanol: 20–25 mg Alpha-lipoic acid: 100–300 mg (I take 300 mg with each meal, but some people experience acid reflux symptoms with more than 100 mg) Green tea flavanols (decaffeinated with at least 325 mg EGCG): 325 mg Garlic extract: 200 mg Daily PAGG intake is timed before meals and bed, which produces a schedule like this: Prior to breakfast: AGG Prior to lunch: AGG Prior to dinner: AGG Prior to bed: PAGG AGG is simply PAGG minus policosanol. This dosing schedule is followed six days a week. Take one day off each week and one week off every two months. This week off is critical. ALA helps you store the carbohydrates you eat in muscle or in your liver as opposed to in fat. Decaffeinated green tea extract pills I suggest using an aged-garlic extract (AGE) with high allicin potential that includes all constituent parts, including S-Allyl cysteine. Vitamin Shoppe - Allicin 6000 Garlic, 650 mg, 100 caplets (www.fourhourbody.com/garlic) Mega Green Tea Extract (decaffeinated), 725 mg, 100 capsules (www.fourhourbody.com/greentea) Vitamin Shoppe - Alpha-Lipoic Acid, 300 mg, 60 capsules (www.fourhourbody.com/ala) Nature’s Life - Policosanol, 60 tablets (www.fourhourbody.com/policosanol) You can burn almost four times more fat than usual with two hours of cold exposure I placed an ice pack on the back of my neck and upper trapezius area for 30 minutes, generally in the evening, when my insulin sensitivity is lower than in the morning. Not all fat is equal. There are at least two distinct types: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is what we usually think of as fat, like the marbling on a steak. A WAT cell - an adipocyte - is composed of a single large fat droplet with a single nucleus. BAT, in contrast, is sometimes referred to as “fat-burning fat” and appears to be derived from the same stem cells as muscle tissue. Cold stimulates BAT to burn fat and glucose as heat. 1. Place an ice pack on the back of the neck or upper trapezius area for 20–30 minutes, preferably in the evening, when insulin sensitivity is lowest. 2. Consume at least 500 milliliters of ice water on an empty stomach immediately upon waking. 3. Take 5–10-minute cold showers before breakfast and/or before bed. Take 20-minute baths that induce shivering. Cold water improves immunity. Acute cold exposure has immunostimulating effects, and preheating with physical exercise or a warm shower can enhance this response. ColPaC Gel Wrap (www.fourhourbody.com/colpac) The more a food causes blood sugar to jump, in general, the fatter you will get. Food and liquids took much, much longer to get to my bloodstream than one would expect. In most cases, I peaked one and a half to two and a half hours after food consumption. Cinnamon can be used to reduce the glycemic index of a meal up to 29%. 1. Get freshly ground cinnamon or grind it yourself. Saigon cinnamon (Cinnamomum loureiroi, also known as Vietnamese cinnamon). Four grams of cinnamon = 4 divided by 2.8, or just about one and a half teaspoons. Don’t consume more per day. The easiest thing you can do to decrease glucose spikes is slow down. I had to methodically finish my plate in thirds and train myself to wait five minutes between thirds, usually with the help of iced tea and slices of lemon. It also helps to drink more water to dilute digestion DexCom Seven Plus (www.dexcom.com) The DexCom Seven Plus is the continuous glucose monitor I used and abused. It is an implant that gives you the approximate data of 288 fingertip blood samples per day. I found it invaluable, even as a non-diabetic. WaveSense Jazz Glucometer (www.fourhourbody.com/jazz) This is, by orders of magnitude, the best glucometer I found. It’s small, simple to use, and incredibly consistent, as it accounts and corrects for environmental factors. One of these meals has to be eaten every three hours while you’re awake, and you must eat within one hour of waking and one hour of bed. Option 1: 50 grams of whey protein isolate + half a cup of nuts or two tablespoons of peanut butter Option 2: eight ounces of cooked, white, nonfatty fish (no salmon, mackerel, etc.) + half a cup of nuts or two tablespoons of peanut butter. Acceptable fish include, but are not limited to, lean tuna, white fish, bass, catfish, pike, whiting, and flounder. Option 3: eight ounces of cooked turkey or chicken + half a cup of nuts or two tablespoons of peanut butter Option 4: eight ounces of cooked fattier protein: red meat (à la flank), ground beef, fatty fish, or dark poultry + one tablespoon of olive oil or macadamia oil Option 5: five whole eggs (easiest if hard-boiled) Unlimited quantities of the following are allowed at each meal: Spinach Asparagus Brussels sprouts Kale Collard greens Broccoli rabe Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables Kettlebells (www.fourhourbody.com/kettlebells) Most men should start with a 20-kg (44 lb) or 24-kg (53 lb) kettlebell I did nothing more than one set of 75 swings one hour after a light, protein-rich breakfast, twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. The king of exercises - the two-arm kettlebell swing - is all you need for dramatic changes. • Stand with your feet 6–12 inches outside of shoulder width on either side, each foot pointed outward about 30 degrees. If toes pointed straight ahead were 12:00 on a clock face, your left foot would point at 10:00 or 11:00, and your right would point at 1:00 or 2:00. • Keep your shoulders pulled back (retracted) and down to avoid rounding your back. • The lowering movement (backswing) is a sitting-back-on-a-chair movement, not a squatting-down movement. • Do not let your shoulders go in front of your knees at any point. • Imagine pinching a penny between your butt cheeks when you pop your hips forward. This should be a forceful pop, and it should be impossible to contract your ass more. Setting the expectation that things will be easy results in disappointment and quitting at the smallest hiccup. If you prepare yourself for massive challenges and no such challenges crop up, it will be a pleasant surprise. See the www.fourhourbody.com/exercises for photos of all The Kiwi’s exercises. The only reason I’ll never be fat again is because I start each meal with a base of vegetables that taste good. Then I add my protein. If you have to choose one exercise, choose this one: Using a BOSU or Swiss ball, ensure your ass is close to the floor, usually no more than 6″ off the ground. Then follow these steps: 1. Start with arms stretched overhead as high as possible (I overlap my extended hands as if in a diving position). Keep your arms behind or next to your ears for the entire exercise. 2. Lower under control for 4 seconds until your fingers touch the floor, the entire time attempting to extend your hands further away from the ball. 3. Pause at the bottom for 2 seconds, aiming for maximum elongation (picture 3). 4. Rise under control and pause in the upper, fully contracted position for 2 seconds. The arms should not pass perpendicular with the ground. 5. Repeat for a total of 10 repetitions. Once you can complete 10 repetitions, add weight to your hands. The Cat Vomit Exercise 1. Get on all fours and keep your gaze focused either directly under your head or slightly in front of you. Don’t arch your back or strain your neck. 2. Forcefully exhale from your mouth until all air is fully expelled. Your abs should be contracted from this forceful exhale. Full exhalation is necessary to contract the transverse abdominals, and you’ll use gravity to provide resistance. 3. Hold your breath and pull your belly button upward toward your spine as hard as you can for a target of 8–12 seconds. 4. Inhale fully through the nose after the 8–12 second hold. 5. Take one breath cycle of rest (exhale slowly out the mouth, inhale slowly through the nose), then repeat the above for a total of 10 repetitions. Don’t rely on the plain-vanilla crunch. It’s utterly ineffective. Fast-twitch muscle fibers have the greatest potential for growth, whereas slow-twitch fibers have the least potential. Do not just drop the weight when you hit failure. Attempt to move it, millimeter by millimeter, and then hold it at the limit for five seconds. Only after that should you slowly (take five to ten seconds) lower the weight. The biggest mistake novice trainees make is underestimating the severity of complete failure. “Failure” is not dropping the weight after your last moderately strenuous rep. It is pushing like you have a gun to your head. The last repetition, the point of failure, is the rep that matters. The rest of the repetitions are just a warm-up for that moment. Do not pause at the top or bottom of any movements Take three minutes of rest between all exercises. Time three minutes exactly Separate all the emotion and positive feedback that people derive from the training experience - solid biological data indicate that the optimal training frequency for the vast majority of the population is no more than once a week. Buckwheat Hull Pillows (www.fourhourbody.com/buckwheat) Bucky manufactures comfy pillows filled with natural buckwheat hulls. Buckwheat hulls are lightweight, durable, and fit the contours of your body without getting flattened like normal pillows. The hulls are hypo-allergenic and allow constant air circulation through the pillow, keeping you cool. Perfect for better sleep and better sex. Taking 200 milligrams of huperzine-A 30 minutes before bed can increase total REM by 20–30%. Huperzine-A, an extract of Huperzia serrata, slows the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. It is a popular nootropic (smart drug), and I have used it in the past to accelerate learning and increase the incidence of lucid dreaming. I now only use huperzine-A for the first few weeks of language acquisition, and no more than three days per week to avoid side effects. Two tablespoons of organic almond butter on celery sticks before bed Make a pre-bed snack part of your nutritional program. One to two tablespoons of flaxseed oil (120–240 calories) can be used in combination with the celery-and-almond-butter to further increase cell repair during sleep and thus decrease fatigue. Using a single bedsheet at a room temperature between 67°F and 70°F produced the fastest time to sleep. Consumed within three hours of getting under the sheets, meals of at least 800 milligrams of cholesterol (four or more large whole eggs) and 40 grams of protein produced dramatically faster time-to-sleep scores than meals of lower volume or lower protein and fat. TAKE A COLD BATH ONE HOUR PRIOR TO BED. Put two to three bags of ice from a convenience store ($3–6) into a half-full bathtub until the ice is about 80% melted. Beginners should start by immersing the lower body only and progress to spending the second five minutes with the upper torso submerged as well, keeping the hands out of the water. The Air-O-Swiss Travel Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier Egoscue (www.egoscue.com) Egoscue is a postural therapy program with 24 clinic locations worldwide. The program is designed to treat musculoskeletal. There is no radiation risk with MRIs, and I would therefore suggest one or two of them for nagging pains or injuries. Not to mention the preventative value. Due for a dental cleaning and checkup? Perhaps you want to run comprehensive blood work, which I recommend no less than every six months? International Medical Travel Journal Medical Tourism Guide (www.imtjonline.com/resources/patient-guide) The IMTJ’s 10-step guide to medical tourism is a useful starting framework Bumrungrad Hospital (www.bumrungrad.com) This world-class hospital in Thailand has been featured in the “Top 10 World’s Medical Travel Destinations” Gray’s fundamental tool for identifying imbalances is his brainchild: the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). Find a Functional Movement Screen (FMS) Expert (www.fourhourbody.com/fms) Chop and Lift Video (www.fourhourbody.com/cl) Turkish Get-Up (www.fourhourbody.com/tgu) Zach Even-Esh demonstrates the Turkish get-up. Take note of his timing in this sequence. It’s not one continuous motion, but rather a specific set of movements with brief pauses. The slower you can do this, the better your technique is. Do not rush. Cross-Body One-Arm Single-Leg Deadlift (www.fourhourbody.com/1SDL) This video demonstrates the proper execution of the 1SDL. Squat (www.fourhourbody.com/squat) This is an outstanding tutorial on how to correct the lower back rounding common at the bottom of the squat. There is a right way to run. 1. Use gravity (via forward lean) for forward motion instead of push-off and muscular effort. 2. Land on the balls of the feet and aim to have the feet land under your center of gravity instead of in front of you. 3. Never fully straighten your legs. Keep a slight bend in your legs at all times to prevent push-off. 4. Pull each foot off the ground and towards your buttocks (rather than pushing off) using the hamstrings as soon as it passes under your center of gravity. 5. Maintain at least a 180 step per minute rate, which means at least 90 steps per minute with each leg. This will use muscle elasticity to your advantage. 1. Focus on at least 90 steps per minute with each leg. 2. Lean, but fall like a tree instead of bending at the hips. There should be no sitting back. Think of falling forward from the pelvis rather than from the head. Imagine pulling the heel up to your buttocks at a 45-degree forward angle instead of straight up off the ground. Use minimal arm movement and consider keeping your wrists near your nipples the entire time. Instructionals and videos of almost all CrossFit exercises, routines (often named after people, like “Cindy”), and unfamiliar exercises can be found at www.fourhourbody.com/crossfit. For asphalt and other hard surfaces, I suggest the Inov-8 F-Lite 220, but the F-Lite 230 can be used as well. What not to use: I’ve seen more problems with Newton shoes than any other. Avoid them. Don’t fall for the barefoot myth, either. Four to seven 30-second bursts of all-out (250% VO2 Max) stationary biking, with four minutes of recovery time between bursts. These bursts were performed 3x a week for just two weeks. Total on-bike time for the two weeks was a mere 15 minutes. Endurance capacity for this “sprint” group almost doubled, from 26 to 51 minutes, Gmap Pedometer (www.gmap-pedometer.com) As nice as fancy gadgets can be for tracking your runs or bike routes, a Google Maps hack gives you the same data with no added equipment.

CrossFit Exercises (www.fourhourbody.com/crossfit) Instructional videos of almost every single CrossFit exercise and routine. Inov-8 F-Lite 220 (www.fourhourbody.com/talon220) Inov-8 F-Lite 230 (www.fourhourbody.com/f-lite230) As a general guideline, we don’t want time under tension for exercise sets to exceed 10 seconds, as we want to minimize lactic acid production. Do as little as needed, not as much as possible. Walk as fast as possible for 15 minutes, three sessions per week. The walk is seven and a half minutes out and the same time back. This doesn’t sound difficult, and it isn’t at first. The challenge is that the athlete must walk further out at each session and still return in the same seven and a half minutes. “Walk as fast as possible” means that the athlete should strongly and persistently want to jog. Peak power output and pain tolerance is between 4:00 and 6:00 P.M. in their studies, this corresponds to 8–10 hours after waking. Keep training times consistent so you can accurately gauge progress. Use an average, not just the wake time on a scheduled workout day. SWIMMING I recommend reading the Total Immersion book after watching the DVD, as the drills are nearly impossible to understand otherwise. Aqua Sphere Kaiman goggles, Total Immersion, Freestyle Made Easy, DVD (www.fourhourbody.com/immersion) Aqua Sphere Kaiman Goggles (www.fourhourbody.com/kaiman) Total Immersion Swimming Freestyle Demo by Shinji Takeuchi (www.fourhourbody.com/shinji) Life must be lived forward, but can only be understood backward. 5–10 grams of creatine monohydrate powder per day for two consecutive weeks every two months. If you choose to use this protocol, I suggest tracking and trending hepatic enzymes, BUN, and all the usual blood testing suspects to ensure no kidney problems. You can mimic, even exceed, the supposed life-extending effects of caloric restriction with intermittent fasting Fast-5: Fast for 19 hours beginning at bedtime, followed by five hours of eating as much as necessary to satisfy hunger. This is popular for moderate weight loss, which typically appears starting in the third week and averages one pound of loss per week thereafter. ADCR: Alternate Day Caloric Restriction (ADCR) requires that calories be cut 50–80% every other day. It has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, autoimmune disease, and even asthma after just two weeks. Iron reduction through phlebotomy (bloodletting) can not only improve insulin sensitivity, but also reduce cancer-specific and all-cause deaths. 1–4 whole blood donations spread two months apart. No leeches required. If you’d like to increase the removal of pesticides and other environmental toxins normally stored in fat, you can do two things: schedule to donate a double portion of plasma, and drink a cup of caffeinated coffee about 60 minutes before going to the center. Most of us have resigned ourselves to a partial completeness, just as Chad Fowler did before losing more than 100 pounds. ""What’s the fastest way for someone to improve their inner game? Improve your outer game."" - Richard Branson If you want to be more confident or effective, rather than relying on easily-defeated positive thinking and mental gymnastics, learn to run faster, lift more than your peers, or lose those last ten pounds. It’s measurable, it’s clear, you can’t lie to yourself. It therefore works. Recall Richard Branson’s answer to the question “How do you become more productive?”: work out. A Dow Joneser: someone whose self-worth is dependent on things largely outside of their control. SpectraCell Nutrient Testing (www.fourhourbody.com/spectracell): $364 This test is used to pinpoint vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies. Of the blood tests, SpectraCell was, across the board, the most immediately impactful. Use www.fourhourbody.com/bloodtests to look up unfamiliar blood test terms, or to get a better understanding of your own results. Food allergy experiments and polling: most problems are caused by gluten, which you shouldn’t be eating much of in the first place; and you can create food allergies if you eat the same foods and same protein sources all the time. The fix: Follow the Slow-Carb Diet, and change your main protein sources and staple meals every month or so. The Quantified Self (www.quantifiedself.com) Curated by Wired cofounding editor Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf, a managing editor of Wired, this is the perfect home for all self-experimenters. The resources section alone is worth a trip to this site, which provides the most comprehensive list of data-tracking tools and services on the web (www.fourhourbody.com/quantified). Daytum (www.daytum.com) Conceived by Ryan Case and Nicholas Felton, Daytum is an elegant and intuitive service for examining and visualizing your everyday habits and routines. Observational studies cannot control or even document all of the variables involved. Observational studies can only show correlation: A and B both exist at the same time in one group. They cannot show cause and effect. List of Cognitive Biases: (www.fourhourbody.com/biases) Brazil nuts have been shown in clinical studies to be more effective than supplementation for increasing selenium, so 400 micrograms is approximately eight nuts per day (49 micrograms each). Testing a primarily plant-based diet (what I’ll refer to as “PPBD”), Step 1. Remove starches (rice, bread, grains) and add legumes. Dense products, like black bean burgers without buns, are encouraged. Step 2. Ensure that all of your meat is pasture-raised, grass-fed, or sourced within 50 miles of your home. Step 3. Eat meat only after 6:00 P.M. (what Mark Bittman and others refer to as the “vegan till 6” plan) or eat meat only on the weekends or on cheat days. Step 4. Remove all meat except fish (pescatarian) and/or eggs and dairy (lacto-ovo vegetarian). Step 5. Eat a 100% plant-based vegan diet. The most consistently recommended protein powders among vegan athletes are: Sun Warrior Chocolate Brown Rice Protein (rice protein) Pure Advantage Pea Protein Isolate (pea protein) Nitro Fusion Plant Fusion (rice, pea, and artichoke protein) I have also confirmed each of these as non-vomit-inducing when blended with 1–2 tablespoons of almond butter and either ice water, almond milk, or coconut milk. Choose mild hunger over breaking your rules. 5 grams of creatine daily for 6 weeks, and the researchers concluded that “Creatine supplementation had a significant positive effect (p<0.0001) on both working memory (backward digit span) and intelligence (Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices).” 2 grams per day did not replicate these results in separate studies. Currently my main source of isolated protein is pea and rice protein powders, my favorite being Plant Fusion by Nitro Fusion. Presoaked almonds (soak the almonds in water 3–4 hours or overnight) Mysteries are not necessarily miracles. Eighty to 90 models have helped Charles Munger develop, in Warren Buffett’s words, “the best 30-second mind in the world. He goes from A to Z in one move. He sees the essence of everything before you even finish the sentence.” Charles Munger likes to quote Charles Darwin: Even people who aren’t geniuses can outthink the rest of mankind if they develop certain thinking habits. ######### QUOTES: “Everything popular is wrong.” - Oscar Wilde We seem to have confused comfort with happiness. - Dean Karnazes The less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it. - Mark Twain It is vain to do with more what can be done with less. - William of Occam “Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, and add what is uniquely your own.” - Bruce Lee ######### URLS and their redirect: http://www.bodybuilding.com/superhuman http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/tim-ferriss-superhuman.htm?mcid=superhuman http://www.dailyburn.com/superhuman http://dailyburn.com/superhuman http://www.fourhourbody.com/phil http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Phil-Libin-Fat-Loss-Glide-Path.xls http://www.fourhourbody.com/cq http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/usp/super.html&cjsku=10087 http://www.athleticgreens.com http://www.fourhourbody.com/thera http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GBOMNE http://www.fourhourbody.com/minibands http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?cid=138 http://www.fourhourbody.com/garlic http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/nw/gar.html&cjsku=6881 http://www.fourhourbody.com/greentea http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/le/megagreenteaextract.html&cjsku=11699 http://www.fourhourbody.com/ala http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/now/ala.html&cjsku=NOW584 http://www.fourhourbody.com/policosanol http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/now/poli.html&cjsku=9293 http://www.fourhourbody.com/colpac http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EAPNCQ http://www.dexcom.com http://www.fourhourbody.com/jazz http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031ERL7W http://www.fourhourbody.com/exercises http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/exercises/ http://www.fourhourbody.com/kettlebells http://www.kettlebellkettlebells.com?apid=index&abid=cee541d4 http://www.fourhourbody.com/buckwheat http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HVVFK http://www.egoscue.com http://www.imtjonline.com/resources/patient-guide http://www.bumrungrad.com http://www.fourhourbody.com/fms http://www.functionalmovement.com/SITE/functionalmovementscreen/locatefmstrainer.php http://www.fourhourbody.com/cl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gACSxA9oM http://www.fourhourbody.com/tgu http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNVi6H3OUVs http://www.fourhourbody.com/1SDL http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWLg7MrA9y4 http://www.fourhourbody.com/squat http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq8CWv8UPAI http://www.fourhourbody.com/crossfit http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercise.html http://www.gmap-pedometer.com http://www.crossfitendurance.com/ http://www.fourhourbody.com/crossfit http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/excercise.html http://www.fourhourbody.com/talon220 http://www.inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&L=27&P=5050973118 http://www.fourhourbody.com/f-lite230 http://www.inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&L=27&P=5050973021 http://www.fourhourbody.com/immersion http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDK78W http://www.fourhourbody.com/kaiman http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DN89Q6 http://www.fourhourbody.com/shinji http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpFVvho0o4 http://www.fourhourbody.com/bloodtests http://www.labtestsonline.org http://www.fourhourbody.com/spectracell http://www.spectracell.com/ http://www.quantifiedself.com http://quantifiedself.com/ http://www.fourhourbody.com/quantified http://www.kk.org/quantifiedself/qs-resource-links.php http://www.daytum.com http://www.fourhourbody.com/biases http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases","Amazing book for anyone wanting to improve their body.

Hackers & Painters,Paul Graham,1449389554,7,"Why does everyone talk about making money? It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand how to make money. Programming languages are what programmers think in. Innovation and heresy are practically the same thing. Good hackers develop a habit of questioning everything. No art, however minor, demands less than total dedication if you want to excel in it. Nerds were being trained to get the right answers, the popular kids were being trained to please. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks. Why do people move to suburbia? To have kids! No wonder they seem boring and sterile. The whole place was a giant nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of breeding children. Nowhere to go, and nothing to do. This is no accident. Suburbs are deliberately designed to exclude the outside world. Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry. You should figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do. Realizing this has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen. The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications. That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product. When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can't do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you'll inevitably be working on projects of your own. Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them. When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed. Looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success. One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a technical matter to someone without a technical background. It would be a remarkable coincidence if ours were the first era to get everything just right. It's tantalizing to think we believe things that people in the future will find ridiculous. What would someone coming back to visit us in a time machine have to be careful not to say? Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers? No one gets in trouble for saying that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad. The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true. It's likely that visitors from the future would agree with at least some of the statements that get people in trouble today. To find them, keep track of opinions that get people in trouble, and start asking, could this be true? In one culture X is ok, and in another it's considered shocking. My hypothesis is that the side that's shocked is most likely to be the mistaken one. I suspect the only taboos that are more than taboos are the ones that are universal, or nearly so. Murder for example. But any idea that's considered harmless in a significant percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours, is a good candidate for something we're mistaken about. A lot of my friends are starting to have children now, and they're all trying not to use words like ""fuck"" and ""shit"" within baby's hearing, lest baby start using these words too. But these words are part of the language, and adults use them all the time. So parents are giving their kids an inaccurate idea of the language by not using them. Why do they do this? Because they don't think it's fitting that kids should use the whole language. We like children to seem innocent. Moral fashions more often seem to be created deliberately. When there's something we can't say, it's often because some group doesn't want us to. The prohibition will be strongest when the group is nervous. What groups are powerful but nervous, and what ideas would they like to suppress? What ideas were tarnished by association when they ended up on the losing side of a recent struggle? If a self-consciously cool person wanted to differentiate himself from preceding fashions (e.g. from his parents), which of their ideas would he tend to reject? What are conventional-minded people afraid of saying? I'm especially curious about anything that's forbidden. Let me see and decide for myself. I do it because it's good for the brain. To do good work you need a brain that can go anywhere. And you especially need a brain that's in the habit of going where it's not supposed to. Great work tends to grow out of ideas that others have overlooked, and no idea is so overlooked as one that's unthinkable. There seems a clear correlation between intelligence and willingness to consider shocking ideas. This isn't just because smart people actively work to find holes in conventional thinking. Conventions also have less hold over them to start with. Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages beyond the thoughts themselves. It's like stretching. When you stretch before running, you put your body into positions much more extreme than any it will assume during the run. If you can think things so outside the box that they'd make people's hair stand on end, you'll have no trouble with the small trips outside the box that people call innovative. When you find something you can't say, what do you do with it? My advice is, don't say it. Being labelled as a yellowist will just be a distraction. Argue with idiots, and you become an idiot. The most important thing is to be able to think what you want, not to say what you want. And if you feel you have to say everything you think, it may inhibit you from thinking improper thoughts. I think it's better to follow the opposite policy. Draw a sharp line between your thoughts and your speech. Inside your head, anything is allowed. Within my head I make a point of encouraging the most outrageous thoughts I can imagine. The trouble with keeping your thoughts secret, though, is that you lose the advantages of discussion. Talking about an idea leads to more ideas. So the optimal plan, if you can manage it, is to have a few trusted friends you can speak openly to. This is not just a way to develop ideas; it's also a good rule of thumb for choosing friends. The people you can say heretical things to without getting jumped on are also the most interesting to know. Ask anyone, and they'll say the same thing: they're pretty open-minded, though they draw the line at things that are really wrong. To see fashion in your own time, though, requires a conscious effort. Without time to give you distance, you have to create distance yourself. Instead of being part of the mob, stand as far away from it as you can and watch what it's doing. And pay especially close attention whenever an idea is being suppressed. What exactly is ""hate speech?"" This sounds like a phrase out of 1984. Labels like that are probably the biggest external clue. If a statement is false, that's the worst thing you can say about it. You don't need to say that it's heretical. And if it isn't false, it shouldn't be suppressed. So when you see statements being attacked as x-ist or y-ic (substitute your current values of x and y), whether in 1630 or 2030, that's a sure sign that something is wrong. Everyone encourages you to grow up to the point where you can discount your own bad moods. Few encourage you to continue to the point where you can discount society's bad moods. To programmers, ""hacker"" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants. The noun ""hack"" also has two senses. It can be either a compliment or an insult. It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way. But when you do something so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also called a hack. Disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that make good programmers. They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate new speech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them a certain problem can't be solved. Suppress one, and you suppress the other. Hackers are unruly. That is the essence of hacking. And it is also the essence of American-ness. It is no accident that Silicon Valley is in America, and not France, or Germany, or England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside the lines. A society in which people can do and say what they want will also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than those sponsored by the most influential people. A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem. There is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world. You can make more wealth. Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history. Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth. The world is - and you specifically are - one pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car, you'll get more for it. In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer. You haven't made anyone else poorer. So there is obviously not a fixed pie. With the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is computer programmers. Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they created. Someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue. Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors. Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work alone. Most employees' work is tangled together. A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers don't see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average. If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. When you take the ten best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It's a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small group of their peers than to average it with everyone. That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company. McDonald's, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the face of the earth. A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a retailer, but by designing a new kind of store. If you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice. I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach cruising altitude. It's also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users. Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world. It was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact only started to be called ""corruption"") when there started to be other, faster ways to get rich. Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor? It will certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive. That's the whole point of technology. Variation in income is a sign of health. Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If we don't see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren't doing it or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it. If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself. A building or object should let you use it as you want: a good building, for example, will serve as a backdrop for whatever life people want to lead in it, instead of making them live as if they were executing a program written by the architect. If function is hard enough, form is forced to follow it, because there is no effort to spare for error. Wild animals are beautiful because they have hard lives. A novice imitates without knowing it; next he tries consciously to be original; finally, he decides it's more important to be right than original. Today's experimental error is tomorrow's new theory. If you want to discover great new things, then instead of turning a blind eye to the places where conventional wisdom and truth don't quite meet, you should pay particular attention to them. It's easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty. Most of the people who've made beautiful things seem to have done it by fixing something they thought ugly. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. One of the reasons Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them out loud to her family. That's why she never sinks into self-indulgently arty descriptions of landscapes, or pretentious philosophizing.","A collection of essays from one of the best.

I Will Teach You To Be Rich,Ramit Sethi,0761147489,7,"If you have very good credit, you should call your credit cards and lenders once per year to ask them what advantages you're eligible for. Often, they can waive fees, extend credit, and give you private promotions that others don't have access to. Call them up and use this line: ""Hi there. I just checked my credit and noticed that I have a 750 credit score, which is pretty good. I've been a customer of yours for the last four years, so I'm wondering what special promotions and offers you have for me. I'm thinking of fee waivers and special offers that you use for customer retention."" Trip-cancellation insurance: If you book tickets for a vacation and then get sick and can't travel, your airline will charge you hefty fees to re-book your ticket. Just call your credit card and ask for the trip-cancellation insurance to kick in, and they'll cover those change fees—usually up to $1,000 per year. If you have no debt, close as many accounts as you want. It won't affect your credit utilization score. Online banks like ING Direct and Emigrant Direct offer simple banking with great rewards and almost no downsides. I think of my checking account like an e-mail inbox: All my money goes in my checking account, and then I regularly filter it out to appropriate accounts, like savings and investing, using automatic transfers. Think of savings accounts as places for short-term (one month) to midterm savings (five years). You want to use your savings account to save up for things like a vacation. The most important practical difference between checking accounts and savings accounts is that you withdraw money regularly from your checking account - but you should rarely withdraw from your savings account. For consumer protection, I pay my bills using my credit card. My ING Direct savings account automatically withdraws a certain amount every month from my checking account, as does my investment account. All of my money goes through my interest-bearing Schwab online checking account. I use the Schwab ATM card to withdraw money at any ATM nationwide. I use my ING Direct account as a receiver, not a sender: I rarely transfer money out of there unless I need to cover a temporary shortage in my checking account or want to spend savings money on something important, like a vacation or birthday gift.

Leave one and a half months of living expenses in your checking account. Transfer the rest to your savings. Once you've set up your 401(k) and dispelled your debt, it's time to start funding a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is another type of retirement account with significant tax advantages.

Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes,ovich and Belsky,0684859386,7,"One of the most common and costly money mistakes - the tendency to value some dollars less than others and thus to waste them. This kind of thinking - “I have to be careful with my retirement money” - exposes you to a far more dangerous risk than the short-term ups and downs of the stock market: you run the risk that you won’t have saved enough when your retirement finally rolls around. You’re prone to wasting money because you wrongly put different values on the same dollars. Our feelings about loss - called “loss aversion” in psychoeconomic lingo - and our inability to forget money that’s already been spent - termed the “sunk cost fallacy” - make us too ready to throw good money after bad. In financial matters this phenomenon results in a willingness to take more risk if it means avoiding a sure loss and to be more conservative when given the opportunity to lock in a sure gain. Gamblers often increase their bets when chance is not going their way; they’re willing to take a bigger risk to avoid finishing in the red. The difference between earning $10 or $20 for a job well done has a bigger effect on how happy you are than a difference between earning $110 or $120. Prospect theory says that we assign values to the gains or losses themselves - based on their own merits, if you will, as gains or losses. It is the actual gaining or losing - and our feelings about it - that matter more to us, rather than how those gains or losses leave us in terms of our overall financial position. North Korea seems more similar to China than China seems to North Korea. Although stocks seem to rise steadily over time, they actually do so in major fits and starts - a few big gains on a small number of days sprinkled throughout the year. By pulling your money out in reaction to short-term drops, you run the risk of missing those productive days. And it’s a serious risk. According to a study conducted in 1994 by University of Michigan finance professor H. Nejat Seyhun, if you had missed the forty best-performing days of the stock market from 1963 to 1993, your average annual return would have dropped from almost 12 percent, assuming you had stayed fully invested, to slightly more than 7 percent. The stocks that investors sold outperformed the stocks that they held on to by 3.4 percentage points over the ensuing twelve months. In other words, investors sold the stocks they should have kept and kept the stocks they should have sold. And remember, this isn’t an occasional result; it’s a persistent pattern among thousands of investors studied by Odean. The tendency to hold losers too long and sell winners too soon. It is, in effect, an extension of prospect theory and loss aversion. Most people are much more willing to lock in the sure gain that comes with selling a winning stock or fund than they are willing to lock in the sure loss of selling a losing investment, even though it generally makes more sense to sell the losers and keep the winners. Until you actually sell a losing investment the drop in price is only a “paper loss” - it’s not official. Once you sell it, though, it’s real. This, of course, is creative mental accounting at its worst: the unrealized losses are segregated or compartmentalized in a separate account precisely because they’re unrealized. Loss aversion tells us it is less painful - and more common - to sell winners and keep losers. Odean’s research says it’s a lot smarter to do the opposite. Being overly sensitive to loss leads people to opt for a certain gain over one that offers a high possibility of a larger gain. In real life that usually translates into a preference for fixed-income investments over stocks. A guaranteed 6 percent or 7 percent annual return from Uncle Sam may seem a lot more appealing than the “chance” to earn 11 percent or more a year in stocks. But as we’ll see later on, the dangers of the stock market may not be as important as the ravages of inflation. So to the extent that you opt for “safe” investments - such as bonds, annuities, and other fixed-income or life insurance products - over riskier but generally higher-paying ones, your loss aversion may be costing you a lot of money. The people who paid more for their tickets ended up attending the performances more often than those who had received discounts. The more people spent on their tickets, the greater their sunk costs, and the more seriously they took attendance at the plays. People fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy because they don’t want to appear wasteful. Not necessarily to other people, mind you; most people act as their own judge and jury Say you have $10,000 of Microsoft stock that you bought for $5,000, and $10,000 of IBM stock that you bought for $20,000. Your child’s first-semester tuition bill of $10,000 is due. Which stock would you sell? If your answer is the Microsoft, you’re mortal like the rest of us. And your aversion to loss is likely to leave you poorer than you need to be. (The best strategy, perhaps, might be to sell $5,000 worth of each company’s stock, thus avoiding the need to pay any taxes!) Stocks on average have returned about 6 percent a year over the past seven decades, adjusted for inflation. That figure didn’t materialize by virtue of magic or voodoo. During the period in question, corporate profits rose an inflation-adjusted average of about 3 percent annually, while the average stock yielded roughly 3 percent a year in dividends. You must avoid looking at losses or gains in isolation. You have to train yourself to view your individual investments as parts of a broader whole. We spend more money on car repairs because we’ve already spent so much on the car. We keep spending money on tennis lessons because we’ve already spent so much. We hold on to bad investments because we can’t get over how much we paid for them and can’t bear to make that bad investment “final.” Well, get over it. No, we’re not trying to be harsh. If we could, we’d send you a pill that erases the memory of every dollar you ever spent (except, perhaps, when filling out expense reports and tax returns). That’s because once spent, it’s gone. It has no relevance (except maybe for refunds). To the extent that you can incorporate that notion into your financial decisions, you’ll be that much better off for trying. If you’re debating the sale of an investment (or a home), for example, remember that your goal is to maximize your wealth and your enjoyment. The goal is not to justify your decision to buy the investment at whatever price you originally paid for it. Who cares? What counts, in terms of getting where you want to be tomorrow, is what that investment is worth today. That’s why you must evaluate all investments (and expenses) based on their current potential for future loss and future gain. The more frequently you check your investments, the more you’ll notice - and feel the urge to react to - the ups and downs that are an inevitable part of the stock and bond markets. For most investors - frankly, for all investors who don’t trade professionally - a yearly review of your portfolio is frequent enough to make necessary adjustments in your allocation of assets. The more choices people face in life, the more likely they are to simply do nothing. Tax-deferred retirement accounts are the very portfolios where the risks of investing in stocks are most mitigated: who cares if the short-term value of your 401(k) account goes up and down with the stock market? By the time you’ll need the money - presuming you have at least ten years until retirement - chances are that the roller-coaster nature of equities will be a memory. The more time you have to do a task - any task - the less pressure you feel to “get with it”. The decision to invest or not, to spend or not, or to marry or not may be influenced by fear, confusion, or doubt. Nonetheless, keeping things as they are is a vote of confidence for current circumstances, however weakly that vote may be cast. In fact, the preference for “holding on to what you got” is a lot stronger than most people think. The endowment effect leads people to ignore opportunity costs. A concept that envelops much of prospect theory and its attendant tendencies - loss aversion, the status quo bias, and the endowment effect. The idea - which behavioral economists call “regret aversion” - is as simple as it sounds. Most people want to avoid the pain of regret and the responsibility for negative outcomes. And to the extent that decisions to act - decisions to change the status quo - impart a higher level of responsibility than decisions to do nothing, people are naturally averse to sticking their necks out and setting themselves up for feelings of regret. You probably pay good money all the time to avoid feelings of regret or to otherwise maintain the status quo. Leaving money in a bank account rather than putting the cash in an investment with a higher return. Staying in a relatively low-paying job rather than making a switch to one with a higher salary. Failing to sell an investment only to see it drop in price. People experience more regret over their mistakes of action in the short term, while regrets of inaction are the ones that are more painful in the long run. Remember: Deciding not to decide is a decision. Even if a financial decision is not perfect (most are not), it may still leave you in a better position than if you had done nothing. Put yourself on autopilot. Instead of having to make an endless series of decisions about whether now is a good time to invest, use dollar cost averaging. Approach decisions from a neutral state. In other words, force yourself to imagine that you’re starting from ground zero rather than from a status quo position. Reverse the context in which you perceive the choice at hand. In other words, turn a decision of which option to reject into one of which option to select, and vice versa. This should help you focus on both the positive and the negative attributes of your options, rather than give disproportionate weight to one or the other. For example, if you’re deciding among investment options and you find yourself unable to choose which one you prefer, ask yourself instead which options you would (in no instance) choose. Or, assume instead that you already own all of the choices. Now your decision becomes which one to sell - which ones you definitely do not want to own. The hard part is recognizing that your decision is being hampered by the way you’re viewing the problem to begin with. “Money illusion.” This involves a confusion between “nominal” changes in money (greater or lesser numbers of actual dollars) and “real” changes (greater or lesser buying power) that reflect inflation or, more rarely these days, deflation. That’s the irony of a so-called conservative investment strategy: it is arguably more risky (and reckless) to leave yourself vulnerable to the ravages of inflation than it is to subject yourself to the hills and valleys of the stock market. Failing to take small numbers seriously can have profound effects when stretched out over time. It’s one thing to tack on a $500 stereo when you’re buying a $12,000 new car; such things happen infrequently enough. But it’s another thing to incur small expenses or small losses repeatedly over a long period; such things add up. The expense ratio tells you how much the fund operator will subtract from your account every year. Some hard-and-fast rules you can live by that will help you overcome the problems that number numbness may present. Don’t be impressed by short-term success. It’s too easy to overlook the deleterious effects that time, in the form of inflation, can have on buying power and to remind you that stocks have proven to be the best way to maintain buying power, given their long history of far outpacing the general rise in consumer prices. Steer clear of funds that charge more than 1 percent or so in annual expenses. “Confirmation bias.” This bias consists of a tendency to search for, treat kindly, and be overly impressed by information that confirms your initial impressions or preferences. Coming at this from the other direction, it could also be called a “disconfirmation disinclination,” because it is paired with a tendency, once you get an idea in your head, to avoid asking questions that may challenge your preconceptions. Write out the pros and cons of each option. Benjamin Franklin, in fact, recommended just such a procedure. But many find the exercise unhelpful. They frequently stop midway and exclaim, “This isn’t coming out right. It’s not favoring the one I want!” A preference they didn’t know they had suddenly asserts itself and does away with a procedure that would lead to the “wrong” decision. The confirmation bias can affect almost any decision you make. Once you develop a feeling about an issue - no matter how unconscious that preference might be - it becomes that much harder to overcome your bias. Mercedes “loyalists” paid an average of $7,410 more for their new cars than did buyers who switched to Mercedes from another make. We can’t stress enough that you are particularly prone to anchoring on a particular dollar figure when you’re swimming in unfamiliar waters. Because people’s natural bias is to confirm what they already “know” or think they know, they reflexively try to prove a rule by looking for facts that would support it rather than looking for information that might contradict. Confirmation bias can be summed up with a simple statement: People often hear what they want to hear. Broaden your board of advisers. We can’t stress enough the importance of getting a second opinion, of conferring with other people when making large financial decisions. True, they may fall victim to the same bad habits as you. But maybe their mental bugaboos are triggered by other factors than yours, and anyway, it’s a lot easier to recognize someone else’s problem than your own. When in doubt, check it out. The less knowledge you have about a subject, the more likely you are to pay attention to information that really doesn’t matter when making decisions that really do - the more likely you will be to anchor on a dollar value that has little basis in reality. That’s why it’s important to comparison shop - not so much to find the best price as to find the correct starting point of reference. Throughout the world, most investors own more stock of companies in their own country than of those in foreign countries. A psychological need on the part of investors to feel comfortable about their investments, with that comfort coming from familiarity. People overconfidently confuse familiarity with knowledge. For every example of a person who made money on an investment because she used a company’s product or understood its strategy, we can give you five instances where such knowledge was insufficient to justify the investment. A classic example is Apple. Many people overestimate their hit-to-miss ratio, either because they conveniently ignore or explain away their failures or because they don’t do a full accounting. If you are a person who’s prone to kicking yourself for investment opportunities that you missed, we suggest you undertake the following exercise. For at least a month, write down every investment idea that you have, then tuck that paper away in a drawer somewhere. In about a year take it out and see how all your picks have done. We suspect that while several will have outperformed the market, an equal or greater number won’t. Again, this is a useful and interesting way to avoid succumbing to fond memories. A helpful way to deal with overconfidence is to incorporate an “overconfidence discount” into your projections, both on the upside and on the downside. Large trends or fads begin when individuals decide to ignore their private information and focus instead on the actions of others, even if that action conflicts with their own knowledge or instincts. Investors who received no news performed better than those who received a constant stream of information, good and bad. In fact, among investors who were trading the more volatile stock, those who remained in the dark earned more than twice as much money as those whose trades were influenced by the media. “Extreme returns of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange were found to be subsequently followed by significant price movement in the opposite direction. Using ten-year blocks of time, loser portfolios earned from the beginning to the end of the five-year holding periods an average of 30% more than the winner portfolios. Using the same procedure with six-year blocks of time, losers outperformed winners by almost 25% during the three-year holding periods.” Let’s restate that in simpler terms. Thaler and De Bondt showed that when investors react in extremes - remember, they looked at stocks whose prices bounced up or down in excess of the movements of the typical NYSE share - those reactions will likely be reversed over time. When a company’s stock price is dampened by pessimistic investors, odds are it will bounce back. Conversely, when a firm’s share price is inflated by overly optimistic buyers, odds are it will fall back. It’s an example, once again, of regression to the mean - the idea that extremes tend to revert back to something closer to the average. But it’s also a reminder that the crowd is often wrong. An entire school of investing is based on the premise that over short periods the market is often misguided but over the long run true value will win out. This school - called “value investing” - counts among its “graduates” some of the best investment minds in history, including Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett. Identifying companies that are out of favor with investors for any number of reasons, none of which has to do with their core business prospects. Financial fads are a lot like buses: there’s no sense running after one, since another is certainly on its way. Beginning your search for appropriate investments by focusing on those investments that the general public has turned its back on. One of the smartest ways to evaluate stocks - if you’re determined to do so - is to focus on those with below average price-to-earnings ratios, or P/Es. A P/E is simply the ratio between a stock’s price per share and its profits per share. It’s important that you learn to view all money equally - salary, gifts, savings, even lottery winnings. Past mistakes shouldn’t lead you to make future ones. The past is past, and what matters is what is likely to happen from now on.",My favorite genre of book lately: clear examples of bugs in our brain: where our intuition is wrong. But this one focuses just on money issues. Loss aversion. Sunk cost fallacy. Confirmation bias. Anchoring. Etc. I love this stuff.
CrowdSourcing,Jeff Howe,0307396207,7,"People will work late into the night on one creative endeavor or another in the hope that their community - be it fellow designers, scientists, or computer hackers - acknowledge their contribution in the form of kudos and, just maybe, some measure of fame. Threadless (Community driven T-shirt portal) isn't really in the T-shirt business. It sells community. Ross Zeitz, a 27 year old Threadless designer was hired to help run the community after his designs won a record breaking eight times on the community portal. Labor can often be organized more efficiently in the context of community than it can in the context of a corporation. The best person to do a job is the one who most wants to do that job; and the best people to evaluate their performance are their friends and peers who, by the way, will enthusiastically pitch in to improve the final product simply for the sheer pleasure of helping one another and creating something beautiful from which they will all benefit. The rise of the network allows us to exploit the fact of human labor that long predates the Internet. The ability to divvy up an overwhelming task - such as the writing of an exhaustive encyclopedia - into small enough chunks that completing it becomes not only feasible, but fun. Crowdsourcing has the capacity to form a sort of perfect meritocracy. The quality of work takes precedence over pedigree, race, gender, age and qualification. Crowdsourcing has revealed that, contrary to conventional wisdom, humans do not always behave in predictably self-interested patterns. People are driven to contribute for a complex web of motivations, including a desire to create something from which the larger community would benefit as well as the sheer joy of practicing a craft at which they excel. People are inspired to contribute to crowdsourcing endeavors for similar motivations, though financial incentives also play a role, especially when the contributors hail from developing countries. What unites all successful crowdsourcing efforts is a deep commitment to the community. Compelling high resolution images have become ubiquitous, yet professional photo agencies treat them like a scarce resource. (iStockPhoto changes that equation) Two shared attributes among almost all crowdsourcing projects: - Participants are not primarily motivated by Money - They are donating their leisure hours to the cause. In this environment, the ""professional"" has never been more widely distrusted and the ""amateur"" more cheerfully embraced. Crowdsourcing has no more regard for professional qualifications than it has for nationality. Companies like InnoCentive and iStock are meritocracies; all that matters is the final product. This is one of its greatest strengths. The untrained eye is also untainted. Their (InnoCentive's) greatest asset is a fresh pair of eyes, which is simply a restatement of the truism that with many eyes, all flaws become evident, and easily corrected. Ken Thompson made Unix out of small, discrete programs meant to do one thing but to do it well. Such an architecture would eventually allow hundreds of programmers to work together in a totally decentralized fashion - in much the same way thousands of contributors work together today in a decentralized fashion to form a single reference work, Wikipedia. Breaking labor into little units, or modules, is one of the hallmarks of crowdsourcing. ""To build a new system, you don't compete with the old one, you build a new system that makes the old one obsolete"" - Buckminster Fuller Hawthorne Heights (Indie Band) - Each musician would spend four to five hours online everyday, engaging their fans in banter and generally making themselves accessible. The fans loved it! The fans couldn't believe they were actually getting a response, they had a fan for life because of that! By frequently updating their blog and swapping in new songs on their MySpace profile, Hawthorne Heights was able to give fans a reason to return. Paid employees can be told what to do, online communities do what they want - Its often a price well worth paying. Linda Parker (""Online communities editor"", for the Cincinati Post) - ""It used to read, 'Be a Citizen Journalist' and no one ever clicked on it, then we said, ""Tell us your story"" and still nothing. For some reason, 'Get Published' were the magic words."" Von Hippel (Head of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Group at MIT's Sloan School of Management) demonstrated that in fields as wide ranging as scientific instruments and mountain bikes and computer chips, the task of innovation was passing from the manufacturer to the user, who has both a greater need and a greater ability to improve a product's performance. Companies that embraced this change entered into a creative relationship with their customers, even going so far as to provide them with tools to help design the end products. Motivation is of 2 types - Extrinsic - The Carrot (Financial Reward) and The Stick (A scolding from your boss) - Intrinsic - goals such as creative fulfillment, a belief in the project, the sense of community obligation, the opportunity to enhance one's reputation in the community. What makes the online community a more efficient workforce than one managed by a firm? The short answer is that communities are better at both identifying talented people and evaluating their output. The right person with the right combination of talent, willingness, and a few spare hours will take on the job. (Context - Wikipedia - who would write each of the 2.2 million entries on the portal) TopCoder - unique model for community based software developement. They broke tasks down into the smallest possible discrete parts, the smaller the block, the more ways they could use it. A Job has to conform to a given individual's ""spare cycle"", or excess capacity - The hours between work and sleep. The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools and Societies. (Book released in 2007) - The Diversity Trumps Ability Theorem - Given certain conditions, a randomly selected collection of problem solvers outperforms a collection of the best individual problem solvers. The types of crowdsourcing that traffic in collective intelligence take three primary forms. - The first category is the prediction market, or the information market, in which investors purchase ""futures"" pegged to some expected outcome, such as the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, or the Presidential election. - The second form is the problem solving, or crowdcasting, network, in which someone with a problem broadcasts it to a large, undefined network of potential solvers. - The third category is the ""idea jam"" which is essentially just a massive online brainstorming session that takes place over the course of weeks instead of hours. Collective intelligence works better in practice than it does in theory. Crowdsourcing is rooted in a fundamentally egalitarian principle: every individual possesses some knowledge or talent tat some other individual will find valuable. In the broadest terms, crowdsourcing involves making a connection between the two. Mathworks (The company that developed MATLAB) - In an office full of developers, if one person solves a problem, everyone else will gather around to see how they did it, have their ""aha"" moment, then factor it into their own code. (Context - Matworks held a tourney in the 70s to solve the 'Travelling Salesman Problem' where people would submit algorithms to solve the problem and the most efficient algorithm would be declared the winner. But participants were allowed to steal each other's code in order to create a better solution). Based on the above, Mathworks noticed that the best algorithm at the end of the contest period exceeds the best algorithm from day one by a magnitude of one thousand. The brown socks beat Mensa! Advances are made in great leaps, which are followed by longer periods of minor tweaking. Get enough people together - be it in a bar or a chat room - and a mysterious dynamic kicks in. People either accentuate their differences and polarize into opposing camps, or they downplay their differences alogether in order to reach a consensus. Both phenmoena have the same net effect: The diversity within the crowd is diminished. There are other conditions that must be met for diversity to trump ability - First, it must be a pickle of a problem - Secondly, the crowd must have some qualifications to solve the problem at hand. There must be a method of aggregating and processing each individual's contribution. - Finally, participants must be drawn from a large enough pool to guarantee a diverse array of approaches, and the ability to express their individuality - Their ""local knowledge"" - must not be impaired. The group is smarter than its smartest individual. The mistakes cancel one another out, and correct answers, like cream, rise to the surface. The odds of a solver's success increased in fields in which they had no formal expertise. The farther the problem was from their specialized knowledge, the more likely it was to be solved. Dell's IdeaStorm employs another crucial element of crowdsourcing - the crowd's collective opinion. The ultimate success of one solution is not diminished by the number of unsuccessful solutions. As more people apply more diverse sets of problem solving methods, the odds that someone will crack the nut can't help but go up. And if they're wrong, you can just ignore them. But this truth only applies to crowdcasting projects like the Netflix Prize and InnoCentive. When we're using the crowd to predict the future, every response counts in the final tally. In these cases, the role of diversity is far more complex. Microsoft, Eli Lilly, Goldman Sachs, and Deustche Bank have all used prediction markets to help determine corporate strategy. The reason diversity trumps ability in a problem - solving scenario is because you can always throw the idiots off the bus. Before the rise of mass reproduction - there was far less of a distinction between audience and creator. New musical compositions were distributed as sheet music, which could then be interpreted according to regional preference and individual whim. Entertainment was a private affair composed of people entertaining one another. There were very few cultural products that we would describe as ""hits"" by today's standards. This changed quickly and dramatically with the rise of modern technologies. The mass production and distribution of culture required a more passive form of consumption. Crowdsourcing depends on the exceptions - Hand a camera to one hundred people and you'll get 99 blurry snapshots and one indelible or salable image. The essence of crowdsourcing such creative work lies in culling the brilliant from the banal. Crowdsourcing creative work involves cultivating a robust community composed of people with a deep and ongoing commitment to their craft and to one another. The best ideas result in enhanced status for their authors. Others naturally strive to meet or exceed the standard set by most talented of their peers, a tendency that effectively increases the overall quality of the work produced by the community. Much of the interaction between community members revolves around improving their skills. People like to learn and they like to teach. The community has an unerring ability to identify its most talented members and highlight their work. Crowdsourcing the stuff people make - as opposed to the stuff they already know - threatens to disrupt and ultimately displace established companies. iStocker (Stock photography portal) - developed a credit system - a user could download one image for every image of theirs that had been downloaded by someone else. People react with great hostility to the idea that crowdsourcing equals cost savings. No one wants to feel exploited. If you are inviting the crowd to the party, you might as well ask them to help with the planning and cleanup. The crowd likes to be involved. It is not so much about giving the crowd easier tasks, as it is about building a strategy around the fact that different people are good at different things, have different amounts of time to commit, or simply have different interests. Pioneers - they are the ones with arrows in their backs. We had far more guests than anticipated and we didn't have anyone to greet them when they showed up. It was a fateful mistake. (Context - AssignmentZero, a collaboration between Wired and NewAssignment.net started a community portal but launched without having someone upfront who would manage the community.) Don't try to control the discussion, just provide the room in which it takes place. You can't issue directives to a community, you can only offer suggestions. If people follow you , great. If not, you follow the community. AssignmentZero's community of journalists ensured that the interviewer was well informed, asked challenging questions, and managed to elicit interesting commentary. Most participants will have very little to contribute - tasks have to be constructed to accommodate a range of commitment levels. American Idol heralded the dawn of a new era. Voting was no longer something you did every couple of years; it was something you did every few days over your cellphone. Voting became part of the culture. Today, people have the opportunity to vote for everything. The contributions generated by the crowd are far too numerous for anyone but the crowd itself to filter. Only the collective attention of the crowd, and its enthusiastic embrace of the five-star system, has the manpower - to create an effective filter. Collective decisions made by millions of Internet users is being used to create a comprehensive classification system where users vote on which news stories of the day deserve attention. (Context - Digg.com) Sturgeon's Law - 90% of everything is crap. The 1:10:89 Rule - For every given 100 people, 1 will actually create something, 10 will vote on what he created and the remaining 89% will merely consume. Threadless (T-shirt makers) - All products sold by Threadless are inspected and approved by user consensus before any larger investment is made into a new product. Users also have the ability to check the 'I'd buy it!' box next to the scale.- a strategy called ""collective customer commitment"". The dual benefits of giving your customers a vote is you have their commitment and the company knows how much demand exists for every shirt it produces. Small wonder then that every shirt sells out. Crowdfunding - Directly connecting the people who have money to the people who need it. Matt and Jessica Flannery, founders of Kiva.org (a micro lending site) Who better to decide what should be created than the person who will ultimately consume the product? Ten Rules of Crowdsourcing - Pick the Right Model (successful crowdsourcing projects use a combination of these approaches) - Collective intelligence or crowd wisdom - Crowd Creation - Crowd Voting - Crowd Funding - Pick the Right Crowd - Offer the right incentives Attracting a crowd is much easier than keeping them. The most important component to a successful crowdsourcing effort is a vibrant, committed community and understanding what motivates people to contribute in the first place. People ned to feel rewarded for their efforts. - Keep the pink slips in the drawer. An editor's role will be to lead a conversation, not to deliver a monologue. - The dumbness of crowds, or the Benevolent Dictator Principle People might be enthusiastic and capable of some level of self organization but they also require directions and guidance and someone to answer their questions. Most successful crowdsourcing efforts are products of a robust collaboration between the crowd and the individuals guiding them. These people focussed the collective and corrected for some of the common hive mind failure modes. - Keep it simple and break it down Modules that can be independently produced before they are assembled into a whole. - Remember Sturgeon's Law - Real talent will remain a rare commodity. - Remember the 10%, the Antidote to Sturgeon's law. If you find yourself inundated with submissions, don't bother sifting through them yourself. Allowing the crowd to find the best and brightest diamonds in the rough. - The community is always right Communities need a decider (as well as a helping hand, a shoulder to cry on, and occasional dean of discipline. You can try to guide the community, but ultimately, wind up following them. - Ask not what the crowd can do for you, but what you can do for the crowd. Crowdsourcing works best when an individual or company gives the crowd something it wants. People are drawn to participate because some psychological, social or emotional need is being met. And the need isn't met, they don't participate.","Great look at a different way of getting a project done: not outsourcing it to a person, but developing a system where thousands of people can contribute a little bit."
The Magic of Thinking Big,David Schwartz,0671646788,7,"Belief - the ""I'm positive I can"" attitude - generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe ""I can do it"", the ""how to do it"" develops. Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great things. ""OK - I'll give it a try but i don't think it will work"" attitude produces failures. It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers. ""We need from every man who aspires to leadership - for himself and his company - a determination to undertake a personal program of self-development."" Any training program must provide (1) what to do (2) how to do it (3) results. No one is born with confidence. Action cures fear. Cure fear and win confidence: 1. Isolate your fear. Pin it down. Determine exactly what you are afraid of. 2. Take action. There is some kind of action for any kind of fear. Setbacks? Confident, successful people don't give it another thought. Successful people specialize in putting positive thoughts into their memory bank. Get a balanced view of the other person. Keep these two things in mind when dealing with other people: 1. The other person is important. Every human being is. 2. But also: you are important, too. So when you meet, make it a policy to think, ""We're just two important people sitting down to discuss something of mutual interest and benefit."" An exercise to help you measure your true size: 1. Determine your five chief assets. (Education, experience, appearance, home life, attitude, personality, etc.) 2. Under each asset, write the names of three people who have achieved a large success but who do not have this asset to as great a degree as you. Look at things not as they are, but as they can be. Visualization adds value to everything. A big thinker always visualizes what can be done in the future. He isn't stuck in the present. Practice adding value to things. Remember the real estate example. Ask yourself, ""What can I do to add value to this room or this house or this business?"" Look for ideas to make things worth more. A thing - whether it be a vacant lot, a house, or a business - has value in proportion to the ideas for using it. Practice adding value to people. As you move higher in the world, more of your job becomes people development. Ask, ""What can I do to add value to my subordinates? What can I do to help them become more effective?"" Remember, to bring out the best in a person, you must first visualize his best. Practice adding value to yourself. Ask, ""What can I do to make myself more valuable today?"" MEASURE THE SIZE OF YOUR THINKING: Expense accounts petty: reduces expenses big: increases income by selling more Conversation petty: talks negative big: talks positive Progress petty: retrenchment or status quo big: expansion Future petty: limited big: promising Work petty: looks for ways to avoid work big: looks for more ways and things to do, especially helping others Competition petty: competes with the average big: competes with the best Budget petty: cutting down on necessary items big: increase income and buy more of what's necessary Goals petty: short run big: long run ""There are some very sharp men in this room."" The executive presented his problem, then listened. Test your own views in the form of questions. Let other people help you smooth and polish your ideas. Use ""what do you think of this suggestion?"" Don't be dogmatic. Rub shoulders, and minds, with other success-oriented people. To gain the respect of others, you must first think you deserve respect. The more respect you have for yourself, the more respect others will have for you. As you approach your job each day, ask yourself, ""Am I worthy in every respect of being imitated? Are all my habits such that I would be glad to see them in my subordinates?"" What happens on weekends and nights directly affects a person's perfomance during the workday. The person with a constructive office-job life nearly always is more successful than the person who lives in a dull dreary home situation. Make your environment make you successful. Get your advice from successful people. Your future is important. Never risk it with freelance advisors who are living failures. Get plenty of psychological sunshine. Circulate in new groups. Discover new and stimulating things to do. One way to build enthusiasm to a new location: resolve to dig into the new community. Learn all you can about it. Mix with the people. Make yourself feel and think like a community citizen from the very first day. Do this, and you'll be enthusiastic about your new environment. People do more for you when you make them feel important. Customers will buy more from you, employees will work harder for you, associates will go out of their way to cooperate with you - if you will only make these people feel more important. Have the courage to face your faults. Many ambitious people go through life with admirable persistence and show of ambition, but they fail to succeed because they don't experiment with new approaches. Stay with your goal. Don't waver an inch from it. But don't beat your head against a wall. If you aren't getting results, try a new approach. The company president ought to be trying to keep his mind free of inconsequential details and doing his own thinking on the basic principles and factors - so that he can make clear and better judgements. Where do you want your company to be 10 years from now? Form an image now of the person you want to be 10 years from now. Not being specific about what you want is like going to an airline ticket counter and saying, ""Give me a ticket."" The people selling tickets can't help you unless you give them a destination. The most important qualification for an executive is the sheer desire to get ahead. You are not pulled to high levels of success. Rather you are *lifted* there by those working beside and below you. Leadership principles: 1. Trade minds with the people you want to influence. 2. Think: What is the human way to handle this? 3. Think progress, believe in progress, push for progress. 4. Take time out to confer with yourself and develop your supreme thinking power.",A classic self-help book. Exactly what you'd expect. But very good.
The Art of Learning,Josh Waitzkin,126713647,7,"Entity vs Incremental theories of intelligence: (by Carol Dweck) Entity theorists think ""I am smart at this"" and attribute success or failure to ingrained and unalterable level of ability. They see it as a fixed entity that cannot evolve. Incremental theorists thnk ""I got it because I worked very hard at it"" or ""I should have tried harder"". With hard work, difficult material can be grasped, step by step, incrementally, the novice can become the master. When challenged, incremental theorists are far more likely to rise to the level of the game, while entity theorists are brittle and quit. Children who associate success with hard work tend to have a ""mastery-oriented response"" to challenging situations. The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic long-term learning process, and not live in a shell of static safe mediocrity. Growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety. Like a hermit crab, when you outgrow your shell, you need to be vulnerable while you find a new shell. Someone stuck in entity mindset is like an anorexic hermit crab, starving itself so it doesn't grow to have to find a new shell. Many people take a process-first philosophy and transform it into an excuse for never putting themselves on the line or pretending not to care about results. They claim to be egoless, to care only about learning, but really this is an excuse to avoid confronting themselves. Short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if they are balanced within a nurturing long-term philosophy. Too much sheltering from results can be stunting. We have to take responsibilty for ourselves and nurture a healthy liberated mind-set. We need to put ourselves out there, give it our all, and reap the lesson, win or lose. There will be nothing learned from any challenge in which we don't try our hardest. Growth comes at the point of resistance. We learn by pushing ourselves and finding what really lies at the outer reaches of our abilities. The importance of regaining presence and clarity of mind after making a serious error. The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th error creates a devastating chain reaction. If a student of any discipline could avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice, they would skyrocket to the top of their field. Of course this is impossible - we are bound to repeat thematic errors if only because many themes are elusive and difficult to pinpoint. Minimize repetition as much as possible by having an eye for consistent psychological and technical themes of error. It's essential to have a liberating incremental approach that allows for times when you are not in a peak performance state. We must take responsibilty for ourselves and not expect the rest of the world to understand what it takes to become the best that we can become. Great ones are willing to get burned again and again while they sharpen their swords in the fire. Making smaller circles: Those who succeed have slightly more honed skills than the rest. It's rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set. Depth beats breadth, because it opens a channel for the intangible, unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential. Intuition is our most valuable compass in this world. It is the bridge between the unconscious and the concscious mind, and it is hugely important to keep in touch with what makes it tick. It's open communication with the wellspring of our creativity. My vision of the road to mastery: - start with the fundamentals - get a solid foundation fueled by the understanding of the principles of your discipline - expand and refine your repertoire, guided by your individual predispositions - while keeping in touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the art What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point. When everyone at a high level has a huge amount of (technical) understanding, much of what separates the great from the very good is deep presence, relaxation of the conscious mind, which allows the unconscious to flow unhindered. This is a nuanced and misunderstood state of mind that when refined involves a subtle reintegration of the conscious mind into a free-flowing unconscious process. The idea is to shift the primary role from the conscious to the unconscious without blissing out and losing the precision the conscious can provide. Compare to putting your attention to your peripheral vision while reading a book, then putting your attention back on the book without losing the peripheral. In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool under fire is much of what separates the best from the mediocre. If one player is serenely present while the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already clear. The prey is no longer objective, makes compounding mistakes, and the predator moves in for the kill. This issue is even more critical in solitary pursuits such as writing, painting, thinking, or learning. In the absence of continual external reinforcement, we must be our own monitor, and quality of presence is often the best gauge. We cannot expect to touch excellence if ""going through the motions"" is the norm of our lives. If deep, fluid presence becomes second nature, then life, art, and learning take on a richness that will continually surprise and delight. Those who excel are those who maximize each moment's creative potential - for these masters of living, presence to the day-to-day learning process is akin to that purity of focus others dream of achieving in rare climactic moments when everything is on the line. The secret is that everything is always on the line. If we have any hope of attaining excellence, let alone of showing what we've got under pressure, we have to be prepared by a lifestyle of reinforcement. Presence must be like breathing. Practice the ebb and flow of stress and recovery. Instead of working until you are exhausted, push yourself to a healthy limit, then recover for a minute or two, and push yourself again. Create a rhythm of intervals. With practice, increase the intensity and duration of your sprint time, and gradually condense rest periods. When Garry Kasparov handled his occasional lack of confidence by playing the chess moves that he would have played if he were feeling confident. He would pretend to feel confident, and hopefully trigger the state. Step by step, Garry would feed off his own chess moves, until soon enough the confidence would become real and Garry would be in the flow. In one way of looking at it, Garry was not pretending. He was not being artificial. He was triggering his zone by playing Kasparov chess. All of the learning principles discussed in this book spring out of the deep, creative plunge into an initially small pool of information. Study positions of reduced complexity. Apply internalized principles to increasingly complex scenarios. Take a single technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence. Gradually condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal. Focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the mind perceives them in tremendous detail. Once we have felt the profound refinement of a skill, no matter how small it may be, we can then use that feeling as a beacon of quality as we expand our focus onto more and more material. Once you know what ""good"" feels like, you can zero in on it, search it out regardless of the pursuit.","Chess master becomes Tai Chi master, realizes his real genius is learning, and shares his insights and stories."

The uniquely qualified minds to make new discoveries were outside the boundaries of his organization. Harness the new collaboration or perish. Those who fail to grasp this will find themselves ever more isolated: cut off from networks sharing, adapting, and updating knowledge to create value. Firms that cultivate nimble trust-based relationships with external collaborators are positioned to form vibrant business ecosystems that create value more effectively than hierarchially organized business. This threatens entrenched barriers to entry, including the high costs of obtaining the financial, physical, and human capital necessary to compete. Firms can no longer depend only on internal capabilities or a handful of business partners to meet external needs.

Internet : This is the first time when children are authorities on something really important. The marketplace is theoretically the best mechanism for matching supply with demand, establishing prices, and extracting maximum utility from finite resources. So why don't all individuals act as individual buyers and sellers, rather than gather in companies with tens of thousands of coworkers? A firm will expand until the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market. As long as it is cheaper to perform a transaction inside your firm, keep it there. But if it is cheaper to go to the marketplace, do not try to do it internally. Or, backwards : firms should shrink until the cost of performing a transaction internally no longer exceeds the cost of performing it externally. ------ CH. 3 The most skilled and experienced members of the community provide leadership and help integrate contributions from the community. Peering helps assign the right person to the right task more effectively than traditional firms. The reason is self-selection: when people voluntarily self-select for creative, knowledge-intensive tasks, they are more likely than managers to choose tasks for which they are uniquely qualified. As long as communities have mechanisms for weeding out weak contributions, then large self-selecting communities of people in constant communication have a higher probability of matching the best people to the right tasks. Collaborative outsourcing works best in areas that are not core to your product or central to your business model. Weaknesses. Areas where your market efforts have floundered. Look for opportunities that attract customers or have industry disruption potential. Attaching yourself to existing movements that have momentum will create the best results. --- CH. 4 Someone outside your organization knows how to answer your specific question, solve your specific problem, or take advantage of your current opportunity better than you do. You need to find them, and find a way to work collaboratively and productively with them. ----- CH. 5 Shoe designer taking designs from the world : promised to adorn any shoe design he adopts with the name of the designer. Generate vibrant customer ecosystems where users help advance, implement, and even market new product features. Mark Vidler, Go Home Productions: ""You don't need a distributor, because your distribution is the internet. You don't need a record label, because it's your bedroom. You don't need a recording studio, because that's your computer. You do it all yourself."" Mashup artists typically spend an extraordinary amount of time producing extremely creative stuff that has one effect: to promote the underlying music. (And are often shut down for it.) Are editors really in a position to best the collective judgement of the audience? If the community is the best arbiter of relevance, do we really need editors? Offer a parallel front page, edited by readers. As long as the media thinks they know what's right, they'll never be in a position to harness people's collective intelligence. Customer tool kits and context orchestration: Forget about static, immovable products. If your customers are going to treat products as platforms anyway, then you may as well get ahead of the game. Make your products modular, reconfigurable, and editable. Set the context for customer innovation and collaboration. Provide venues. Build user-friendly customer tool kits. Supply the raw materials that customers need to add value to your product. Make it easy to remix and share. Your real business is not creating finished products but innovating ecosystems. Customers will expect to share in the ownership and fruits of their creations. If you make it profitable for customers to get involved, you will always be able to count on a dynamic and fertile ecosystem for growth and innovation. Customers won't care whether their activities make you more money (that's your job) - they'll just want a superior product and experience, and perhaps even a cut of the revenue. ----- CH. 7 The best examples are the developer communities that have built up around eBay, Google, Amazon. External partners can build tools to leverage the database information, invent new kinds of stores or applications, and generally integrate their business processes. 40% of goods on eBay are now uploaded automatically from the inventory systems of 3rd-party stores that use eBay as an alternative sales channel. Open up your platforms to increase the speed, scope, and success of innovation. How do I make my organization a platform for participation? How, when, and where do I open up my business? How do I attract an energetic group of people to share the innovation load? Outside developer made : An instant-messaging application that enables IM users to ping Amazon with a request and have it message you back with links to relevant products. Amazon Web Services give developers access to numerous Amazon software services, like its shopping cart, and every fragment of data they could wish for, including text for product descriptions and reviews, product images, and pricing information. AWS evangelist Jeff Barr calls these the fundamental building blocks that external developers use to construct applications. Developers can build any application they see fit. No one has to ask for permission or await approval. No haggling over specs or schedules. Amazon has a head start in a wide variety of areas such as pricing transparency, RSS advertising, and comparison shopping. RefundPlease uses Amazon's own pricing info to inform customers if an item they've purchased drops within 30 days of purchase. Amazon will refund the difference to boost loyalty. The more data we're able to put in the hands of developers, the more interesting tools, sites, applications will be built, and the more of those that exist, the greater the return to Amazon. We're going to see more traffic, more clicks, and ultimately more purchases. It's not just a science experiment. Hiking Outpost: a specialist book retailer aggregates info about trails and camping sites from around the web, and Amazon handles credit-card processing, order shipping, and returns. Referral fees are 4-7.5%, based on the total number of items shipped. Amazon enhances its competitiveness because there is now less incentive for competitors to build a competing platform when they can leverage Amazon's for free. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Om Malik blog post : ""I wonder if this culture of participation was helping build businesses on our collective backs. If we tag, bookmark, or share and help del.icio.us or Technorati or Yahoo become better commerical entities, aren't we commoditizing our most valuable asset: time? We become the outsourced workforce, though it is still unclear what is the payoff. While we may gain something from the collective efforts, the odds are whatever the collective efforts are, they are going to boost the economic value of those entities. Will we share in the upside? Not likely!"" Once a platform like Google, Amazon, or SAP gains traction, there is less and less incentive for people to defect to other platforms. The trend is self-reinforcing. More developers create better offerings, attracting more customers. Most of the free electrons will gravitate towards the biggest centers of gravity. Companies with the most dynamic platforms - with great opportunities for partners to establish a synergistic business - will have the best chance of harnessing the enormous wealth of talent that all those free agents can offer. The bigger the ecosystem, the better, because bigger ecosystems support more raw intelligence and more requisite variety. Becoming a pervasive and continually innovative presence means becoming a magnet for innovation that attracts lots of partners, suppliers, developers, customers, and other interested participants who are willing to build on your organization's platform. ---- CH. 9 We are shifting from closed and hierarchical workplaces with rigid employment relationships to increasingly self-organized, distributed, and collaborative human capital networks that draw knowledge and resources from inside and outside the firm. ---- CH. 10 If a small underperforming company in one of the world's oldest industries (Goldcorp) can achieve greatness by opening its doors to external input and innovation, what would happen if more organizations followed the same strategy? Couldn't just about any social or economic challenge be solved with a critical mass of self-organized contributors seeking an answer to the problem? Wouldn't businesses be more productive if they could reach outside their walls to harness the insights and energies of a vast network of peers that converge around shared interests and goals? If so, how would the traditional corporation change? What new business models could be built on this new collaborative approach to producing goods and services? Jim Griffin on music biz : ""Tarzan economics : we cling to the vine that holds us off the jungle floor, and we can't let go of the one we've got until we've got the next vine firmly in our hand."" Firms threatened by self-organizing prosumer communities face the innovator's dilemma. The innovator taps a low-cost or no-cost volunteer production resource. You cannot prevent the inevitable. You may be able to slow it temporarily, but the slowing just makes the ultimate endgame come faster. Paradigms are mental models that constrain our thinking and are often based on assumptions so strong we don't notice them. New paradigms cause disruption and uncertainty, even calamity, and are nearly always received with coolness, hostility, or worse. Vested interests fight against the change, and leaders of the old are often the last to embrace the new. Consequently, a paradigm shift typically causes a crisis of leadership. Fine-tune your radar and move quickly to seize the opportunities for influence as a new business paradigm takes hold. Move early to participate in building a brand-new business. By joining the community of new innovators, you might even position yourself at the front of the parade. Profound changes favor the newcomer. A new kind of business is emerging: one that - opens its doors to the world - co-innovates with everyone, especially customers - shares resources that were previously closely guarded - harnesses the power of mass collaboration - behaves not as a multinational, but as a truly global firm Make a comprehensive map of your innovation eco system that positions your value creation and aasses the interdependencies that will determine the flow of benefits and your ability to capture a share of them. This is not a traditional competitive analysis or value-chain analysis, but an analysis of the participants creating knowledge pertinent to your existing and future business. While this includes business partners and competitors, it extends to academia, public research institutes, think tanks, creative communities, or communities of practice, and contract research organizations. The map needs to be global and cover all relevant disciplines that intersect with your strategy. You're taking down your borders and opening up for no tariffs, no tax competition. You need to know that your core assets and your skill sets allow you to continue to innovate fast enough as a corporation. Openness does up the ante - it drives real value to the fore and forces every company to compete on a level playing field. Loose, voluntary communities of producers can self-organize to do just about anything: - design goods or services - create knowledge - assemble physical things - produce dynamic shared experiences but don't overlook the fact that these communities operate according to well-defined norms, and have internal processes to guide the group's activities. Debates remain on the public archive. Sharing is about lowering costs, building community, accelerating discovery. The growth of increasingly valuable online resources as a natural by-product of their use by self-regarding individuals. (No altrusitic sharing motives need be present, especially since sharing is the default in most online communities, including Flickr, Napster, and YouTube.) SHARING MAKES SENSE IF THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT: * - Your proprietary offering is failing and open sourcing it could inject the creativity and manpower required to make it succeed in the marketplace. (Sun OpenSparc.) * - Opening up IP in one area could boost demand for complementary product and services offerings. (IBM WebSphere.) * - Advantages of pooling competencies and reducing R&D exceed benefits of having exclusive rights to the knowledge produced. (SNP Consortium.) * - You're seeking a uniquely qualified mind so you enlarge the pool of talent addressing a particular problem. (Goldcorp) * - An open platform will encourage innovation, efficiency, and interoperability with ecosystem partners. (Amazon) * - Sharing is necessary to establish credentials and to develop relationships with other contributors in the community. (SpikeSource) * - Preempting the property rights of competitors shifts the locus of competition or enhances your freedom of action. (Merck's Gene index.) * - Openness removes unnecessary friction in collaborative projects and paves the way for participants to focus on the science (Intel's industry-university partnership) Imagine a digital age co-op, with peer-rating systems that dynamically apportion shares to contributors based on the community's assessment of the value added by individual contributors. Annual profits from sales and services could be distributed across the community of contributors. WIKINOMICS DESIGN PRINCIPLES Throw away some of your detailed plans. Leaders manage chaos the way a kindergarten teacher manages her students. Planning must allow for a high degree of learning on your part. The great examples have adopted their strategies as they learned what worked and what did not work for the overall community. * - Taking cues from your lead users * - Building critical mass * - Supplying an infrastructure for collaboration * - Take your time to get the structures and governance right * - Make sure all participants can harvest some value.

Meatball Sundae,Seth Godin,1591841747,7,"This is a book about the right question: NOT : ""How do we use the cool new tools to support our existing structure?"", but ""How do we become an organization that thrives because of the new marketing?"" NOT : ""How do we use this new marketing to maintain business as usual?"", but ""How can our business itself be altered?"" Ask not what the new marketing can do for you. Ask what you can do to thrive with the new marketing. MEATBALL : a commodity, a branded item of little differentiation and decent quality. You can't grow with meatballs because they're ubiquitious. Stop making meatballs, and start making something that goes very well with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce. Nimble, intelligent organizations that are poised and prepared, ready to be propelled by the fresh tactics of the new marketing. -- Old toy fairs : the manufacturers would show the sellers the commercials 9 months in advance. The commercials that got the best reception led to toys getting made. The rest were cancelled. We make what people buy. If it doesn't sell, it doesn't get made. Business growth comes from satisfying the people who can best leverage your ideas. New marketing doesn't demand better marketing. It demands better products, better services, and better organizations. Marketing doesn't support the organization. The organization supports marketing. Making noise is fun, but making noise is not where the highest returns lie. -- Hiring inexperienced employees: It's easier to teach someone, than to unteach them first. Marketing advice that Josiah Wedgwood might have given his unsuccessful brother Thomas: - create new ways of glazing your goods, and novel items that people seek out - sign your work - increase your pricing by 400% - establish high quality standards - build a bigger factory and put it near a canal, one that you lobbied to have built - train nonpotters to join your workforce, and design innovative ways to manage them - organize the factory to reflect a separation of labor - open showrooms in London and change the stock weekly - focus on mass production - sell to the richest people in the world, but avoid taking custom work except for items for heads of state -- What consumers have wanted all along : to be treated with respect, and to be connected to other people. -- 14 TRENDS: ** DIRECT COMMUNICATION AND COMMERCE BETWEEN PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS An inbound email is not an expense - it's an opportunity - a chance to eliminate barriers and have a dialogue with a prospect or customer. Organized sports saw snacks as a hassle. But (eventually realized) the game was the hassle - they were in the food business. For many organizations, interaction with the outside world quickly becomes their most profitable opportunity. Paying attention to inbound messaging is exactly what threadless.com does for a living. Go from finding customers for your products, to finding products for your customers. Instead of trying to reach the unreachable, do what actually works : start making products, services, and stories that appeal to the reachable, then build that group by serving them. ** AMPLICATION OF THE VOICE OF THE CONSUMER AND INDEPENDENT AUTHORITIES It's not just that individuals are discovering how much power their amplified word-of-mouth has. It's that they've wanted it for so long that they are giddy about it. In any community (Wikipedia, Digg, YouTube) : 1% are the givers. But you don't know who those 1% are, in advance. You can't be like that restaurant on the lookout for that one key food critic from the newspaper. Now you have to be on the lookout for everyone. Blogs convert readers and viewers into writers. Blogs connect three real desires : to hear our own voices, to be heard by others, and to hear what the crowd thinks. Copyblogger says his goal is ""to meet cool people with great skills and great ideas, and do business with them"". Every business has its 1% - a group of customers so motivated, so satisfied, and so connected that they want to tell the rest of the world about you and what you do. Your challenge is to give these people a megaphone. Most people want to be like most people most of the time. ** NEED FOR AN AUTHENTIC STORY AS THE NUMBER OF SOURCES INCREASES ** EXTREMELY SHORT ATTENTION SPANS DUE TO CLUTTER ** THE LONG TAIL In almost every single market, ""other"" is the leading brand. If you could just publish best-sellers, you would. But you can't. In every single micromarket, the market rewards the leader : the best in the world. You can win more often now that there are far more markets in which to win. The number of markets is skyrocketing. Invest what it takes to be seen as the best in any market you chose to compete in. ** OUTSOURCING A marketer without a factory is actually more innovative, faster-moving, and more fashion-focused. Why? Instead of trying to keep the factory busy, the marketer can focus on keeping the market busy instead. Either what you're doing is repetitive, in which case you ought to outsource it, or it's homemade, insightful, and filled with initiative and judgement, in which case you can charge for it. ** GOOGLE AND THE DICING OF EVERYTHING TV shows are bundled with ads. Businesses are bundled in an office building. Book publishers bundle authors and share the expertise of their staff. We've been bundling so long, we forgot we were doing it. ** INFINITE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION ** DIRECT COMMUNICATION AND COMMERCE BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND CONSUMERS ** SHIFTS IN SCARCITY AND ABUNDANCE Talent like this (Ideo) is hard to find, and bores easily when asked to work on a limited range of projects. ** TRIUMPH OF BIG IDEAS The idea must be embedded into the experience of the product itself. Marketing is pushed deeper into the organization. ** SHIFT FROM ""HOW MANY"" TO ""WHO"" ** THE WEALTHY ARE LIKE US The new bell curve: Volume and price used to be __/\__. Now it's -\/-. The curve is reversing. Now there's a dip in the center, with humps at either end. Most people used to buy middle-of-the-road stuff. Few bothered with the dirt-cheap or super-expensive. But now that the cheapest is so available, it polarizes more to go for dirt-cheap or super-expensive. Wal-Mart and Whole Foods. If I want something ordinary, then it better be cheap. I can get cheap and ordinary by the gallon at Costco. Today's spoiled consumer is willing to pay anything for the exclusive, the noteworthy, and the indulgent. ** NEW GATEKEEPERS, NO GATEKEEPERS. About promotion/PR : If it were me, I'd take a longer-term approach. First identify the blogs that actually do have an interest in what I'm trying to have featured. Then I'd read them. Over time, start interacting with those bloggers. Submit relevant links that have nothing to do with my company. Post comments on the field in general. Become part of the circle. Then months or even years later, when I have something relevant to add, I can send a truly personal note to someone I've interacted with. --- Much promotion doesn't work because just knowing about something isn't the same as being excited about it, using it, or best of all: talking about it. Critical-Mass Checklist: 1. Do more users benefit the other users by bringing down prices or increasing the power of communication? 2. Are we falsely relying on the masses to solve problems that are obvious when we have small numbers of customers? 3. How can we lower the number of users we'll need before the benefits of critical mass kick in? 4. Does style matter? Are we betting people will become our customers because ""everyone else is doing it""? If so, how do we realistically cross that chasm? -- We aren't in charge : create an environment where other people could have a conversation. Transform your company into an organization that makes stories. Given an authentic story that matches our worldview, we'll believe it. Given the chance to speak up, we'll do just that - loudly and often. If you want to be in the commodity business, be my guest. If you want to sell large quantities of cheap stuff, you're welcome to it. The rest of us, though, are going to grow fast using our knowledge of human nature and the new marketing that allows people to express that nature. You're doomed to sell a slow-growing commodity only if you want to. Any product, from a cardboard notebook to an accounting firm, can now be transformed, using the tools that are available to everyone. Ideas that spread THROUGH groups of people are far more powerful than ideas delivered AT someone. Create a movement around your product or service.","Instead of asking how to use the new internet tools to support your existing business, ask how you can change your business to take best advantage of the new tools."
Don't Make Me Think,Steve Krug,0321344758,7,"Use conventions so people don't have to think for even a millisecond. Aim for self-evident first. If that fails, self-explanatory should be 2nd best. Try to not need to explain at all. Remember people quickly glance / scan a page, quickly looking for what they need. They don't read all options. They guess fast instead of consider all. 1. Create clear visual hierarchy 2. Use conventions 3. Page is in clearly defined areas 4. Make obvious what's clickable 5. Minimize noise Omit needless words. Avoid happy-talk and instructions. Tabs must be real if you do them : where front-color is connected to content, and non-selected tabs are darkened with line beneath. Navigation is crucial but so is secondary and even third-ary! Don't ignore importance of it. Breadcrumbs help, should be Top > Sub > Sub-Sub > Here (in bold) But don't make breadcrums only navigation, and don't make last category double as page header. Show ""you are here"" clearly. Navigation helps show the context of your offerings. Logo everywhere links to home. The word they click should be the title of the destination page they hit! EVERY PAGE SHOULD ANSWER THESE IMMEDIATELY (assume someone just woke up & saw any page in your site) - what site is this? - what page am I on? - what are the major site sections? - what are my options at this level? - where am I in the scheme of things? - how can I search? HOME PAGE NEEDS: - identify site & mission - answer: where do I start? - show heirarchy - search - teases (like magazine cover, enticing to see content inside) - timely content - deals - short cuts to most popular things - registration / sign-in / show if signed-in (""welcome back Dave!"") - easy to find ""what I'm lookign for"" - but also ""not looking for"" : enticing things they didn't know about HOW TO GET THESE ACROSS: Tagline next to site ID (logo). 6-8 words. Specific. Meaningful and clear. Welcome blurb in top part. 1-2 sentences. Important words bolded. Test it. TESTING TIPS: Just 3-4 people is plenty. Pay $50/hr. Camcorder pointing at screen. Ask them to think out loud. Let them know they can do nothing wrong. When they say something generic, ask details. If they say, ""I like it"", ask what they like, and same with negative. Hide site until time to start. The second they see the home page, ask ""What is this? What would you click on?"" Ignore ""kayak"" problems : the ones they turn around immediately. Resist adding things to solve problems. That's rarely the answer.",The classic book of web usability. Required reading for anyone who makes websites.
The Art of Possibility,Rosamund and Benjamin Zander,25952913,6,"Art is about rearranging us, creating surprising juxtapositions, emotional openings, startling presences. Discouraged? = “What? You’ve been practicing it for three minutes, and you still can’t play it?” It’s all invented anyway, so we might as well invent a story or a framework of meaning that enhances our quality of life and the life of those around us. What assumption am I making, That I’m not aware I’m making, That gives me what I see? What might I now invent, That I haven’t yet invented, That would give me other choices? Speak to people not from a place of measuring how they stack up against your standards, but from a place of respect that gives them room to realize themselves. You already got an A. Now tell, in as much detail as you can, the story of what will have happened to you that is in line with this extraordinary grade. Report on all the insights they acquired and milestones they attained during the year as if those accomplishments were already in the past. Everything must be written in the past tense. The attitude, feelings, and worldview of that person who will have done all she wished to do or become everything he wanted to be. When we give an A we can be open to a perspective different from our own. You certainly can change people. “Who, actually, is doing the changing?” The relationship. When people play a game, they agree to a certain set of limitations to create a challenge. Everything occurs in that context. They challenge us to adapt and hone our skills to win in a distinctive environment that itself can be packed away, or left, once the game is over. If the rules do not light up your life, put it away, take out another one you like better, and play the new game. Only describe ourselves in the light of contribution. Naming oneself and others as a contribution produces a shift away from self-concern and engages us in a relationship with others that is an arena for making a difference. The conductor decides who is playing in his orchestra. He can decide that they are bored and resigned, jaded and disaffected, or the tender and ardent lover of music. Think of “personality” as a strategy for “getting out of childhood alive.” One child may be sociable and outgoing, another may be quiet and thoughtful, but both are aimed at the same thing: to find a safe and identifiable niche in the family and the community and to position themselves to survive. Winning ways: children learn to know themselves. A child comes to think of himself as the personality he gets recognition for. What would have to change for me to be completely fulfilled? Practice being with the way things are. This calls upon us to distinguish between our assumptions, our feelings, and the facts. Start from what is, not from what should be. Without fleeing, blaming, or attempting correction. There is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. If I cannot be present without resistance to the way things are and act effectively, if I feel myself to be wronged, a loser, or a victim, I will tell myself that some assumption I have made is the source of my difficulty. Define yourself not as a piece, nor as the strategist, but as the board itself, the framework for the game of life.","Leadership coach and famous orchestra conductor collaborate on a book about relationships, art, personal development, children, and practice.  Somewhat scattered but had some really interesting ideas."
Pre-Suasion,Robert Cialdini,1501109790,6,"Pre-suasion: the process of arranging for recipients to be receptive to a message before they encounter it. Pre-suasion: the human tendency to assign undue levels of importance to an idea as soon as one’s attention is turned to it. What we present first changes the way people experience what we present to them next. Just putting a large number in their head: The amount of money people said they’d be willing to spend on dinner went up when the restaurant was named Studio 97, as opposed to Studio 17. Top-performing salesman did only one thing different - built trust like this: “Oh, I forgot some really important information in my car, would you mind if I let myself out and back into your home?” The answer was always some form of “Sure, go ahead.” Oftentimes it required giving him a door key. “Who do you let walk in and out of your house on their own? Only somebody you trust, right? I want to be associated with trust in those families’ minds.” Trainees are informed that persuasion is approached differently in their particular profession than in related professions. Distinctions were stressed even within professions. But they didn’t focus enough on an extraordinarily useful other question: What’s the same? Organizations should steer sharply away from unethical persuasive practices, because those practices will lend themselves to the attraction and retention of employees who find cheating acceptable and who will ultimately cheat the organization. The factor most likely to determine a person’s choice in a situation is often not the one that offers the most accurate or useful counsel; instead, it is the one that has been elevated in attention (and thereby in privilege) at the moment of decision. If people see themselves giving special attention to some factor, they become more likely to think of it as a cause. Palm readers’ subjects seek their mind for the trait suggested. “quite a stubborn individual, someone who resists being pressured in a direction you don’t want to go.” This will have focused you on the trait of stubbornness, sending you down a single psychological chute constructed unfairly to confirm it. Here’s how it would work: to test if I were right, you’d automatically begin searching your memory for times when you’d acted stubbornly - only for those times - and you’d almost certainly come upon a ready instance, as mulishness under pressure is a frequent personal failing. If you extended this biased search further, you’d hit on other, similar occurrences. Positive test strategy: in deciding whether a possibility is correct, people typically look for hits rather than misses; for confirmations of the idea rather than for disconfirmations. It is easier to register the presence of something than its absence. Be suspicious if a pollster wants to know only whether you are dissatisfied with something - as well of the one who asks only if you are satisfied. Much better are those that use two-sided questions: “How satisfied or dissatisfied are you?” Cult recruiters often begin by asking if they are unhappy “Well, if you’re unhappy, you’d want to change that, right?” A marketer could greatly increase the chance of finding survey participants by beginning with a particular pre-suasive opener: asking people if they considered themselves helpful. Nearly everyone answered yes. Now 77.3 percent volunteered. (a desire for consistency) It’s not necessary to alter anything at all except what’s prominent in that person’s mind at the moment of decision. 97% consider themselves adventurous. People rightly believe that what they choose to attend to (or away from) reflects what they value at the time. Whatever we can do to focus people on something - an idea, a person, an object - makes that thing seem more important to them than before. People assign more significance to the things they see themselves choosing to move toward. Speaking quietly, making someone lean in to hear, makes them feel it's more important. Reducing the distance to an object makes it seem more worthwhile. Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it. The media persuade indirectly, by giving selected issues and facts better coverage than other issues and facts. That leads the audience to decide that these are the most important issues. The press may not be successful most of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling them what to think about. The persuader who artfully draws outsize attention to the most favorable feature of an offer becomes a successful pre-suader. Mattress seller website focused visitors’ attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background. Distraction: Environmental noise reduces the ability to learn and perform cognitive tasks. Distraction: Classrooms with heavily decorated walls reduce the test scores of young children. The more consideration people give to something, the more extreme (polarized) their opinions of it become. “Satisficing” is a term coined by economist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon - to serve as a blend of the words satisfy and suffice. Two simultaneous goals of a chooser when facing a decision - to make it good and to make it gone. Decision makers are infamous for concentrating on what a strategy could do for them if it succeeded… …and not enough on what it could do to them if it failed. Questions that often don’t arise by themselves: What future events could make this plan go wrong? What would happen to us if it did go wrong? Hearing the same conversation, whomever’s face was more visible was judged to be more causal. The best indicator of a breakup was how much they were regularly aware of and attentive to the hotties around them. People in a wary state of mind are driven by a desire for safety. When they are scared, a popularity-based appeal will work, whereas a distinctiveness-based appeal will not. People in an amorous state of mind are driven by a consequent desire to stand out, so the reverse will occur. When they are in that state, a popularity-based appeal will not work, and a distinctiveness-based appeal will. On a task that we feel committed to performing, we will remember all sorts of elements of it better if we have not yet had the chance to finish, because our attention will remain drawn to it. If we are engaged in such a task and are interrupted or pulled away, we’ll feel a discomforting, gnawing desire to get back to it. That desire - which also pushes us to return to incomplete narratives, unresolved problems, unanswered questions, and unachieved goals - reflects a craving for cognitive closure. Never finish a writing session at the end of a paragraph or even a thought. Know precisely what you want to say at the end of that last paragraph or thought; just don’t allow yourself to say it until the next time. Women were shown profiles of men who had, and some who hadn't, rated them. Men whose ratings remained yet unknown kept popping up in the women’s minds. Because regular attention to something makes it seem more worthy of attention, the women’s repeated refocusing on those guys made them appear the most attractive. When an important outcome is unknown to people, “they can hardly think of anything else.” Beginning each lecture with a mystery. The most successful non-fiction pieces began with a mystery story. The authors described a state of affairs that seemed perplexing and then invited the reader into the subsequent material as a way of dispatching the enigma. Mystery stories were instructionally superior to the other, more common forms of teaching Whereas descriptions require notice and questions require answers, mysteries require explanations. Supply the following information in the following sequence: 1. Pose the Mystery. 2. Deepen the Mystery. 3. Home In on the Proper Explanation by Considering (and Offering Evidence Against) Alternative Explanations. 4. Provide a Clue to the Proper Explanation. 5. Resolve the Mystery. 6. Draw the Implication for the Phenomenon Under Study. Mysteries attract audiences to the fine points of the information - because to resolve any mystery or detective story properly, observers have to be aware of all the relevant details. The mysterious is so remarkable it could be labeled as both “the most beautiful thing we can experience” and “the source of all true science and art.” The main purpose of speech is to direct listeners’ attention to a selected sector of reality. Once that is accomplished, the listeners’ existing associations to the now-spotlighted sector will take over to determine the reaction. Language is primarily a mechanism of influence; as a means for inducing recipients to share a communicator’s conception of reality. or, at least, to act in accord with it. The main function of language is not to express or describe but to influence - something it does by channeling recipients to sectors of reality pre-loaded with a set of mental associations favorable to the communicator’s view. If you want to change the world, change the metaphor. In South Korea, the ads attempted to link products and services mostly to the reader’s family or group, whereas in America it was mostly to the individual reader. The fluency-producing properties of rhyme lead to enhanced persuasion. Writing style leans more popular in community places, and more academic when writing on campus. I needed present reminders of my prospective audience members to keep my writing aligned with their interests and communication styles. 80 percent of all medical students are afflicted by this disorder, in which they experience the symptoms of whatever disease they happen to be learning about at the time and become convinced that they have contracted it. Seniors have decided that they just don’t have time for negativity. They take deliberate steps to achieve emotional contentment by mastering the geography of self-influence. The elderly go more frequently and fully to the locations inside and outside themselves populated by mood-lifting personal experiences. Seniors recall positive memories, entertain pleasant thoughts, seek out and retain favorable information, search for and gaze at happy faces, and focus on the upsides of their consumer products. Manageable activities that reliably increase personal happiness: 1. Count your blessings and gratitudes at the start of every day, and then give yourself concentrated time with them by writing them down. 2. Cultivate optimism by choosing beforehand to look on the bright side of situations, events, and future possibilities. 3. Negate the negative by deliberately limiting time spent dwelling on problems or on unhealthy comparisons with others. The elderly have decided to prioritize emotional contentment as a main life goal and, therefore, to turn their attentions systematically toward the positive. Younger individuals have different primary life goals that include learning, developing, and striving for achievement. Accomplishing those objectives requires a special openness to discomforting elements: demanding tasks, contrary points of view, unfamiliar people, and owning mistakes or failures. It makes sense, then, that in early and middle age, it can be so hard to turn our minds away from tribulations. To serve our principal aims at those times, we need to be receptive to the real presence of negatives in order to learn from and deal with them. Smarter in a general sense: generating good ideas spotting flawed arguments making perceptive comments offering clarifying insights You can’t think straight when you’re scared. You’re much more persistent when you’re confident in your abilities. Mental activity: its elements don’t just fire when ready; they fire when readied. After we attend to a specific concept, those concepts closely linked to it enjoy a privileged moment within our minds. Once an opener concept (German music, weight) receives our attention, closely associated secondary concepts (German wine, substance) become more accessible in consciousness, which greatly improves the chance that we will attend and respond to the linked concepts. Formulate an if/when-then plan - for example, “If/when, after my business lunches, the server asks if I’d like to have dessert, then I will order mint tea.” We become prepared, first, to notice the favorable time or circumstance and, second, to associate it automatically and directly with desired conduct. Will we be leaves in the wind, blown here and there by powerful associations to the cues we happen to encounter? The answer depends on whether we’ve noticed the breeze. Individuals surveyed by phone reported themselves 20 percent more satisfied with their existence - as a whole - when asked on sunny days compared with rainy days. But if the interviewer asked first, “By the way, how’s the weather over there?” the sunny-versus-rainy-day effect didn’t materialize at all. Simply being focused on the weather for a moment, reminded the survey participants of its potentially biasing influence and allowed them to correct their thinking accordingly. Prominence of product placements in episodes of the popular TV sitcom Seinfeld: Survey respondents were least likely to select the products that had been inserted most prominently! The conspicuousness of the placements cued viewers to the advertisers’ sly attempts to sway their preferences and caused a correction against the potential distortion. Whereas the most subtly placed brands were chosen by 47 percent of the audience, only 27 percent picked the most prominently placed ones. They are reminded of the source of the possible bias, so they act to rebalance the system. Deconstruct the word remind into its constituent parts To get them to put their minds on it again. Ads perform better in late-hour slots when we don’t have the ability to think properly - perhaps because we are tired - we can’t rely on a balanced assessment of all the pros and cons to correct for an emotionally based choice we might regret later. Viewers don’t have the mental energy to resist the ads’ emotional triggers Although the typical interrogation lasts for less than an hour, interviews generating false confessions average sixteen hours. We don't think well when fatigued. Besides fatigue, when a person is rushed, overloaded, preoccupied, indifferent, stressed, distracted, or, it seems, a conspiracy theorist. Having insufficient time to analyze all the points of a communication: the way the broadcast media operate, transmitting a swift stream of information that can’t be easily slowed or reversed to give us the chance to process it thoroughly. Instead, we’re left to a focus on secondary features of the presentations, such as the attractiveness of the advertising spokesperson or the politician’s charisma. If we want them to buy a box of expensive chocolates, first arrange for them to write down a number that’s much larger than the price of the chocolates. If we want them to choose a bottle of French wine, expose them to French background music before they decide. If we want them to agree to try an untested product, first inquire whether they consider themselves adventurous. If we want to convince them to select a highly popular item, begin by showing them a scary movie. If we want them to feel warmly toward us, hand them a hot drink. If we want them to be more helpful to us, have them look at photos of individuals standing close together. If we want them to be more achievement oriented, provide them with an image of a runner winning a race. If we want them to make careful assessments, show them a picture of Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker. Communicators can be more effective by highlighting the idea of authority not just inside their message but inside the moment before their message. In this pre-suasive way, audiences will become sensitized to (and thus readied for) the coming authoritative evidence in the message, making them more likely to pay attention to it, assign it importance, and, consequently, be influenced by it. Reciprocation: People say yes to those they owe. Cultures teach the rule from childhood and assign socially punishing names - freeloader, user, taker, parasite - to those who don’t give back after receiving. Shoppers at a candy store became 42 percent more likely to make a purchase if they’d received a gift piece of chocolate upon entry. To optimize the return, what we give first should be experienced as meaningful, unexpected, and customized. After offering guests one chocolate from her basket and turning to walk away, she unexpectedly returned to the table and offered a second chocolate to each diner. As a result, her average tip improved by 21.3 percent. Waitresses coached to mimic the verbal style of customers doubled their tips. To highlight similarities and provide compliments increases liking and assent. I can live for two months on a good compliment. Similarities and compliments cause people to feel that you like them, and once they come to recognize that you like them, they’ll want to do business with you. People trust that those who like them will try to steer them correctly. Show customers that you genuinely like them. Restaurant labeled the items as “most popular” dishes. Each dish became 13 percent to 20 percent more popular. “The medium is the message” - the idea that the channel through which information is sent is a form of consequential messaging itself, which affects how recipients experience content. A communicator who references a weakness early on is immediately seen as more honest. Scarcity : We want more of what we can have less of. If you wake a multimillionaire client at five in the morning and say, ‘If you act now, you will gain twenty thousand dollars,’ he’ll scream at you and slam down the phone. But if you say, ‘If you don’t act now, you will lose twenty thousand dollars,’ he’ll thank you. Promotions that included a purchase limit (“Only x per customer”) more than doubled sales. Communicators who can get us to take a pre-suasive step, even a small one, in the direction of a particular idea or entity will increase our willingness to take a much larger, congruent step when asked. The desire for consistency will prompt it. Having a compelling case to make is not the same as making a case compellingly. Warren Buffett demonstrates that he is, first, fully aware of problems inside the company and, second, fully willing to reveal them. He describes a mistake he’s made or a problem the company has encountered during the past year and examines the implications for future outcomes. “I will tell you what I would say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s future.” Mr. Buffett had me at “family”. When people observe their parents caring for the needs of another in the home, they also experience a family-like feeling and become more willing to give to that other. Children who see their parents open their homes to a range of differing people should be more likely, as adults, to help strangers. For them, we-ness should reach beyond their immediate or extended family and apply to the human family as well. Parents who want their children to develop a broadly charitable nature: give them contact in the home with individuals from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and treat those individuals there like family. Anything too stupid to be spoken is sung. Managers led to believe that they’d had a large role in developing the end product (an ad for a new wristwatch) rated the ad 50 percent more favorably than did managers led to believe they’d had little developmental involvement - even though the final ad they saw was identical. Providing advice puts a person in a merging state of mind, which stimulates a linking of one’s own identity with another party’s. Providing an opinion or expectation, on the other hand, puts a person in an introspective state of mind, which involves focusing on oneself. These only slightly different forms of consumer feedback can have a significant impact on consumer engagement with a brand. When we ask for advice, we are usually looking for an accomplice.",An interesting look at a single topic: what someone encounters beforehand greatly affects the influence of what comes after. Priming.
Surviving AI,Calum Chace,0993211623,6,"Singularity means a point where the normal rules cease to apply, and what lies beyond is un-knowable to anyone this side of the event horizon. Intelligence measures an agent’s general ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. Nine types of intelligence: linguistic logic-mathematical musical spatial bodily interpersonal intra-personal existential naturalistic Whether intelligence resides in the machine or in the software is analogous to the question of whether it resides in the neurons in your brain or in the electrochemical signals that they transmit and receive. Two very different types of artificial intelligence: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) - also known as weak AI artificial general intelligence (AGI) - also known as strong or full AI An AGI is an AI system which can carry out any cognitive function that a human can. We can learn useful lessons from one activity and apply them to another. A machine that learns snakes and ladders has to forget that in order to learn how to play Ludo. This is called “catastrophic forgetting”. “Artificial intelligence”?: Cars are not called artificial horses. Planes are not called artificial birds. A machine learning algorithm uses an initial data set to build an internal model which it uses to make predictions. It tests these predictions against additional data and uses the results to refine the model. 90% of all the data in existence was created in the last two years. Turning Big Data into information and thence into understanding and insight is the job of algorithms. Having more data beats having better data if what you want is to be able to understand, predict and influence the behaviour of large numbers of people. Traditionally, statisticians started with a hypothesis and went to look for data to support or refute it. Machine learning, by contrast, starts with data – lots of it – and looks for patterns. Backpropagation retraces the steps in a neural net to identify the errors made in an initial processing of input data. Categorize machine learning researchers into five tribes: the symbolists, the evolutionaries, the Bayesians, the analogisers, and the connectionists. Symbolists = Good Old-Fashioned AI. Evolutionists start with a group of possible solutions to a problem and produce a second “generation” by introducing small random changes and removing the least effective solutions. Bayesians make hypotheses about uncertain situations and updates its degree of belief in each hypothesis according to a mathematical rule when new evidence is provided. Analogisers: new phenomenon is likely to follow the same behaviour as the previously observed phenomenon which is most like it. Connectionists are trying to reverse engineer the brain by developing artificial neural networks. Connectionism has been re-branded as deep learning, and it has been the most successful form of machine learning so far. Convolutional networks: the neurons in each layer are only connected to groups of neurons in the next layer. Recurrent networks: connections from each layer can loop back to an earlier layer. Supermarkets use algorithms to predict what we will collectively want to buy, when and where. Hospitals use AI to allocate beds. Telecoms companies, power generators and other utilities use it to manage the load on their resources. Google's ambitions are startling, and the hurdle for potential acquisition targets is high: they must pass a “toothbrush test”, meaning that their services must be potentially useful to most people once or twice every day. MemNet predicts the memorability of images. Art: the use of a craft skill to communicate something profound or at least interesting about the condition of being human. Amara’s Law: we tend to over-estimate the effect of a technology in the short run and under-estimate the effect in the long run. You are composed of around 27 trillion cells, which were created by fission, or division – an exponential process. It required 46 steps of fission to create all of your cells. Quantum computing: While classical computers use bits (binary digits) which are either on or off, quantum bits (qubits) can be both on and off at the same time – known as superposition. This enables them to carry out a number of different calculations at once. The hedonic treadmill: we quickly become accustomed to the new reality, and what seemed wonderful in prospects becomes ordinary. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything invented between when you’re 15 and 35 is new and exciting. Anything invented after you're 35 is against the natural order of things, and should be banned. Most of the tasks that we perform each day can be broken down into four fundamental skills: looking/listening reading writing integrating knowledge Restorative justice, in which criminals do as much as possible to undo the harm they have done, is better all round than purely retributive justice. In math and physics, the term “singularity” means a point at which a variable becomes infinite. The classic example is the centre of a black hole, where the gravitational field becomes infinite, and the laws of physics cease to operate. The three biggest questions about artificial general intelligence (AGI) are: 1. Can we build one? 2. If so, when? 3. Will it be safe? The first of these questions is the closest to having an answer, and that answer is “probably, as long as we don't go extinct first”. Our brains were developed by a powerful but inefficient process called evolution. The apparent consciousness of the octopus, with which we share no recent common ancestor, suggests consciousness is more than coincidence. For ages, we tried to fly by copying what birds do, but when we finally did learn to fly, it was not by copying birds. There are still things we don't understand about how birds fly, yet we can now fly further and faster than they can. I don’t worry about turning AI evil now for the same reason I don't worry about the problem of overpopulation on the planet Mars. Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is generally known simply as superintelligence. It does not need the prefix “artificial” since there is no natural predecessor. Neurons signals in our brain travel around 100 metres per second. Synapse crossing is chemicals jumping across the gap. Synapse jumping part is much slower than the electrical part. Signals within computers typically travel at 200 million metres per second. So a brain emulation AGI could operate 2 million times faster than a human. When we create superintelligence, will we create one, two, or many? The first superintelligence may take steps to prevent the creation of a competitor. Superintelligence with human levels of cognitive ability would be a technological marvel, and a harbinger of things to come. Superintelligence would be the game-changer. Our future will depend on its decisions and its actions. Transhumanists believe we have every right to enhance our physical and mental selves using whatever technology we can create – perhaps even that we have a moral duty to do so. Humanity versus a fully fledged superintelligence with internet access would be like the Amish versus the US Army. Intelligence brings enlightenment and enlightenment brings benevolence. The Whig view of history sees the human story as an inevitable progression towards ever greater enlightenment and liberty. We are not intrinsically more violent than other animals. No other carnivore is capable of assembling more than a dozen or so members in one location without a serious fight breaking out. We can use AI to augment us rather than having to compete with it. This is called Intelligence Augmentation, or IA, and is also known as intelligence amplification. The best chess players today are neither humans nor computers, but a combination of both — labelled “centaurs” by Gary Kasparov. Musk believes that humans cannot afford to let machines get much smarter than them, and the only way to avoid that is to – at least partly – merge with them. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics: How far into the future would a robot have to project the consequences of an individual action? How would it assign probabilities to the various different possible outcomes? Since there should be no time limit, a robot would be rendered inactive by the amount of calculation required prior to any action. Humans – as well as the superintelligence – will evolve over time and would not want to be stuck with the particular ideas of morality and pragmatism which happened to prevail in the 21st century. Few of us even know the names of Vasili Arkhipov and Stanislav Petrov, two men who quite literally saved the world during the Cuban missile crisis.","A good overview of Artificial Intelligence. If you know nothing about it, start here, then read “Life 3.0” afterwards."
How Not to Be Wrong,Jordan Ellenberg,9780143127536,6,"Mathematics is the study of things that come out a certain way because there is no other way they could possibly be. Math is like an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength. Mathematics is the extension of common sense by other means. Without the rigorous structure that math provides, common sense can lead you astray. Linearity vs nonlinearity is one of the central distinctions in mathematics. Nonlinear thinking means which way you should go depends on where you already are. The relation between eating and health isn’t linear, but curved, with bad outcomes on both ends. The Laffer curve: The horizontal axis here is level of taxation, and the vertical axis represents the amount of revenue the government takes in from taxpayers. On the left edge of the graph, the tax rate is 0%. Linear reasoning is everywhere. You’re doing it every time you say that if something is good to have, having more of it is even better. Pythagorean's philosophy was a chunky stew of things we’d now call mathematics, things we’d now call religion, and things we’d now call mental illness. If the universe hands you a hard problem, try to solve an easier one instead, and hope the simple version is close enough to the original problem that the universe doesn’t object. George Berkeley denounced Newton’s infinitesimals in a tone of high mockery sadly absent from current mathematical literature. 0.33333…=1/3 Multiply both sides by 3 and you’ll see 0.99999…=3/3=1 There’s a whole field of mathematics that specializes in contemplating numbers of this kind, called nonstandard analysis. .9 + .09 + .009 + .0009 + … That pesky ellipsis is the real problem. In the real world, you can never have infinitely many. What’s the numerical value of an infinite sum? It doesn’t have one - until we give it one. We should simply define the value of the infinite sum to be 1. There are good choices and there are bad ones. In the mathematical context, the good choices are the ones that settle unnecessary perplexities without creating new ones. In mathematics, you very seldom get the clearest account of an idea from the person who invented it. Linear regression is a marvelous tool, versatile, scalable, and as easy to execute as clicking a button on your spreadsheet. Whenever you want to understand which variables drive which other variables, and in which direction, it’s the first thing you reach for. And it works on any data set at all. But, like a table saw, if you use it without paying careful attention to what you’re doing, the results can be gruesome. When you’re field-testing a mathematical method, try computing the same thing several different ways. If you get several different answers, something’s wrong with your method. The smaller the sample size - the greater the variation. The law of averages is not very well named, because laws should be true, and this one is false. Coins have no memory. So the next coin you flip has a 50-50 chance of coming up heads, the same as any other. The way the overall proportion settles down to 50% isn’t that fate favors tails to compensate for the heads that have already landed; it’s that those first ten flips become less and less important the more flips we make. Don’t talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be negative. The more chances you give yourself to be surprised, the higher your threshold for surprise had better be. An identical set of winning numbers came up twice in a single week. It was improbable that the names of medieval rabbis are hidden in the letters of the Torah. But is it? Improbability is a relative notion, not an absolute one. When we say an outcome is improbable, we are always saying, explicitly or not, that it is improbable under some set of hypotheses we’ve made about the underlying mechanisms of the world. The null hypothesis, in executive bullet-point form: Run an experiment. Suppose the null hypothesis is true, and let p be the probability (under that hypothesis) of getting results as extreme as those observed. The number p is called the p-value. If it is very small, rejoice; you get to say your results are statistically significant. If it is large, concede that the null hypothesis has not been ruled out. New things require new vocabulary. There are two ways to go: You can cut new words from fresh cloth. But more commonly, we adapt existing words for our own purposes, which stand in only the most tenuous relation to the ordinary things referred to by those words. “significance” is one of those. The lexical double-booking (double meaning) of the word “significance” has consequences. Twice a tiny number is a tiny number. Both numbers are more or less zero. “Statistically noticeable” or “statistically detectable” would be a better term than “statistically significant” That would be truer to the meaning of the method, which merely counsels us about the existence of an effect but is silent about its size or importance. But it’s too late for that. We have the language we have. Statistical study that’s not refined enough to detect a phenomenon of the expected size is called underpowered - the equivalent of looking at the planets with binoculars. Moons or no moons, you get the same result, so you might as well not have bothered. Players who had just made a shot were more likely to take a more difficult shot on their next attempt. The “hot hand” in basketball might “cancel itself out”: players, believing themselves to be hot, get overconfident and take shots they shouldn’t. Suppose the hypothesis H is true. It follows from H that a certain fact F cannot be the case. But F is the case. Therefore, H is false. Suppose the null hypothesis H is true. It follows from H that a certain outcome O is very improbable (say, less than Fisher’s 0.05 threshold). But O was actually observed. Therefore, H is very improbable. Impossible things never happen. But improbable things happen a lot. Every positive number can be expressed in just one way as a product of prime numbers. This is why we don’t take 1 to be a prime, though some mathematicians have done so in the past; it breaks the uniqueness, because if 1 counts as prime, 60 could be written as 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 and 1 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 and 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5… The primes are the atoms of number theory, the basic indivisible entities of which all numbers are made. Primes are not random, but it turns out that in many ways they act as if they were. Pairs of primes that are separated by only 2, like 3-5 and 11-13, and called twin primes. Goldbach conjecture: every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Scientists, subject to the intense pressure to publish lest they perish, are not immune to temptations. It takes a lot of mental strength to stuff years of work in the file drawer. Scientists may “torture the data until it confesses.” The purpose of statistics isn’t to tell us what to believe, but to tell us what to do. Statistics is about making decisions, not answering questions. What’s the purpose of a criminal trial? We might naively say it’s to find out whether the defendant actually committed the crime he’s on trial for. But that’s obviously wrong. There are rules of evidence, which forbid the jury from hearing testimony obtained improperly, even if it might help them accurately determine the defendant’s innocence or guilt. The purpose of a court is not truth, but justice. We have rules, the rules must be obeyed, and when we say that a defendant is “guilty” we mean, if we are careful about our words, not that he committed the crime he’s accused of, but that he was convicted fair and square according to those rules. Most practicing scientists have no interest in denying themselves the self-polluting satisfaction of forming an opinion about which hypotheses are actually true. The significance test is the detective, not the judge. The provocative and oh-so-statistically-significant finding isn’t the conclusion of the scientific process, but the bare beginning. The replication process is supposed to be science’s immune system, swarming over newly introduced objects and killing the ones that don’t belong. But who wants to publish the paper that does the same experiment a year later and gets the same result?","Mathematics as an extension of common sense. I'd like to go through this again, doing and thoroughly understanding all the examples. On the first read, I let it pass over me."
Die Empty,Todd Henry,9781591846994,6,"Instill consistent practices into your life that keep you on a true and steady course. The most valuable land in the world is the graveyard. In the graveyard are buried all of the unwritten novels, never-launched businesses, unreconciled relationships, and all of the other things that people thought, ‘I’ll get around to that tomorrow.’ One day, however, their tomorrows ran out.” Die Empty: If I don’t wake up tomorrow, I have emptied myself of whatever creativity is lingering inside. When you’re gone, your work will stand as the single biggest testament to who you were - the sum total of where you choose to place your limited focus, assets, time, and energy. Your work is the most visible expression of your priorities. Define work as any effort to create value where it didn’t previously exist. Many people do regret not having treated their life with more purpose. Approach work with the kind of intention and conviction that imminent death makes palpable. The more you apply self-knowledge to how you engage your labor, the more satisfaction you will find in the very act of work. We live with the stubborn illusion that we will always have tomorrow to do today’s work. It’s a lie. We need to live with a sense of urgency. Purpose paralysis = fear of getting it wrong. Frustration when the daily grind of work doesn’t seem to reward your pursuit of those flashes of inspiration. Can I lay my head down tonight satisfied with the work I did today? Three Kinds of Work: Mapping, Making, and Meshing. Mapping is planning, plotting your objectives, and setting priorities. It helps you ensure you’re spending your focus, time, and energy in the right places. Making is actually doing the work - executing tasks. Meshing is activities that stretch and grow you, such as acquiring and developing new skills, reinforcing or enhancing your knowledge, cultivating your curiosity, or generating a better understanding of the context for your work. It’s also composed of critical disciplines such as paying attention to the adjacent spaces in your industry and engaging in activities that may not have an immediate payoff, but position you to be more effective in the coming days. Mapping + Making + Meshing = Developer Mapping + Making − Meshing = Driver: Narrowly effective and is often unable to spot or take advantage of opportunities if they are outside his immediate area of focus. Making + Meshing − Mapping = Drifter: a poor planner (Mapping). As a result, he frequently bounces from project to project and goes wherever his latest whim carries him. He has a good work ethic and may even be quite successful in short bursts, but his lack of strategic Mapping means that there is a lot of wasted opportunity and little strategic progress. He lacks the conviction of a long-term plan. Because of his failure to map effectively, the Drifter fails to follow through on many of his ideas and projects. He gets stuck and doesn’t see things through to the end. Meshing + Mapping − Making = Dreamer: a talker, but he rarely accomplishes much because he’s always moving on to the next great thing. You must adopt a Developer mind-set, meaning that you are disciplined about Mapping, Making, and Meshing so that you leverage all the opportunities and resources at your disposal. The love of comfort - when comfort becomes the goal - is frequently the enemy of greatness in life and work. When life doesn’t go the way you expect, it doesn’t necessarily mean that life has gone wrong. The secret is finding the balance between going out to get what you want and being open to the thing that actually winds up coming your way. Flush with obligations and pressures, we neglect our relationships. You go into isolation mode and just keep your head down, cranking away at your work. But when you isolate yourself you cut yourself off from opportunities to grow Scan for relational outages, and remedy them before they become destructive. What’s truly important to you? What battle would you be willing to fight anytime for any reason? Follow your passion frames the conversation as if you are the center of the world, or as if a state of joy, bliss, or fulfillment is the objective of life. Then you spend your life chasing after the next buzz when things get dull. “Follow your passion” : we equate it to following our whims. The most fulfilled people ask “What can I add?” rather than “What can I get?” “Passion” has its roots in the Latin word pati, which means “to suffer or endure.” Instead of asking “What would bring me enjoyment?” ask “What work am I willing to suffer for today?” Suffering for something beyond yourself. Spend yourself. Productive passion is the sort that motivates you and is also beneficial to others. Others-focused, not self-focused. Compassionate anger: “compassion” means to “suffer with” - a desire to step in on behalf of those who are suffering, to rectify a wrong. Your “open loops” - unfinished projects : afraid to say no to, but deep down you know that you can’t commit. These must be either acted upon and made a priority, or immediately closed and put aside. If you have too many open loops in your life, it diminishes your ability to focus on the mission-critical things. You must become good at pruning your projects and commitments so that you have energy available for your most important work.","Motivating thoughts on doing your work. Your work is the expression of your priorities. “Work” = creating value where it didn't previously exist. An interesting definition of three kinds of work: mapping, making, and meshing."
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!",Richard Feynman,0393355624,6,"Invent problems and theorems. If doing any mathematical thing at all, find some practical example for which it would be useful. For example: There’s a flagpole, and there’s a rope that comes down from the top. When you hold the rope straight down, it’s a meter longer than the pole, and when you pull the rope out tight, it’s 1.75 meters from the base of the pole. How high is the pole? When somebody is explaining something that I’m trying to understand: I keep making up examples. I construct something which fits all the conditions. They would tell me the general problem they were working on, and would begin to write a bunch of equations. “Wait a minute,” I would say. “Is there a particular example of this general problem?” “Why yes; of course.” “Good. Give me one example.” That was for me: I can’t understand anything in general unless I’m carrying along in my mind a specific example and watching it go. I have the specific, physical example of what he’s trying to analyze, and I know from instinct and experience the properties of the thing. So when the equation says it should behave so-and-so, and I know that’s the wrong way around, I jump up and say, “Wait! There’s a mistake!” They didn’t put two and two together. They didn’t even know what they “knew.” They didn’t learn by understanding. They learn by some other way - by rote, or something. Their knowledge is so fragile! Learn what the rest of the world is like. The variety is worthwhile. When you say, “I could do that, but I won’t” - it’s just another way of saying that you can’t. No one has ever seen the inside of a brick. Every time you break the brick, you only see a surface. That the brick has an inside is a simple theory which helps us understand things better. I always get into something and see how far I can go. I’m “anti-intellectual”. I always thought the guy who worked in the machine shop and could make things, now he was a real guy! To me, to be a practical man was always a positive virtue, and to be “cultured” or “intellectual” was not. I learned to use one method, and I used that one damn tool again and again. So because I was self-taught using that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals. The result was, when guys had trouble doing a certain integral, it was because they couldn’t do it with the standard methods they had learned in school. Then I come along and try differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a great reputation for doing integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else’s, and they had tried all their tools on it before giving the problem to me. You don’t have to be responsible for the world that you’re in. I have developed a very powerful sense of social irresponsibility as a result. It’s made me a very happy man ever since. I have to have something so that when I don’t have any ideas and I’m not getting anywhere I can say to myself, “At least I’m living; at least I’m doing something; I’m making some contribution” - it’s just psychological. Don't sit in a lovely house by the woods with no obligations. Nothing happens because there’s not enough real activity and challenge. You’re not in contact with the experimental guys. You don’t have to think how to answer questions from the students. Nothing! Students remind me of a problem by asking questions. It’s not so easy to remind yourself of these things. I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn’t have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with. I’d see water running out of a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I could figure out what determines that curve. I found it was rather easy to do. I didn’t have to do it; it wasn’t important for the future of science; somebody else had already done it. That didn’t make any difference: I’d invent things and play with things for my own entertainment. When I felt I was burned out and will never accomplish anything, I decided I’m going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever. It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. I had a way of having adventures which is hard to explain: it’s like fishing, where you put a line out and then you have to have patience. When I would tell someone about some of my adventures, they might say, “Oh, come on - let’s do that!” So we would go to a bar to see if something will happen, and they would lose patience after twenty minutes or so. You have to spend a couple of days before something happens, on average. I decided on something, then I decided then never to decide again. Nothing - absolutely nothing - would ever change my mind again. It’s much easier to just plain decide. I got sick and tired of having to decide what kind of dessert I was going to have at the restaurant, so I decided it would always be chocolate ice cream, and never worried about it again - I had the solution to that problem. “I can’t understand these things. It’s all so complicated.” “No,” she said, “what you mean is not that you can’t understand it, but that you didn’t invent it. You didn’t figure it out your own way, from hearing the clue. What you should do is imagine you’re a student again, and take this paper upstairs, read every line of it, and check the equations. Then you’ll understand it very easily.” I took her advice, and checked through the whole thing, and found it to be very obvious and simple. I had been afraid to read it, thinking it was too difficult. I never pay any attention to anything by “experts.” I calculate everything myself. To sell a drawing is not to make money, but to be sure that it’s in the home of someone who really wants it; someone who would feel bad if they didn’t have it. He said, “You know, you’re never going to draw again.” I said, “What? That’s ridiculous! Why should I never…” “Because you’ve had a one-man show, and you’re only an amateur.” Although I did draw after that, I never worked as hard, with the same energy and intensity, as I did before. I never sold a drawing after that, either. It isn’t the stuff, but the power to make the stuff, that is important. This conference was worse than a Rorschach test: There’s a meaningless inkblot, and the others ask you what you think you see, but when you tell them, they start arguing with you! Scientific integrity, utter honesty: if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid - not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked - to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated. Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can - if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong - to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. Bend over backwards to show how you may be wrong. You must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.","Autobiographical stories. Fun anecdotes. But they give a great glimpse into an approach to life: Doubt, challenge, and most importantly: test everything. Experiment. See what happens in the real-world, not in-theory. Applied not just to science, but how ants find food, talking to strangers in bars, sketching portraits, and playing a shaker in a Brazilian band."
Never Split the Difference (Negotiating),Chris Voss and Tahl Raz,0062407805,6,"He would throw out an offer and give a rationally airtight explanation for why it was a good one - an inescapable logic trap. I’d just answer with some variation of “How am I supposed to do that?” My questions insinuated that the other side was being unfair. That was enough to make them falter and negotiate with themselves. Answering my questions demanded tactical psychological insights that they didn’t have. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want. One of the most potent negotiating tools: the open-ended question. “I’m sorry, Robert, how do I know he’s even alive?” I said, using an apology and his first name, seeding more warmth into the interaction to complicate his plan to bulldoze me. Ask questions that the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys you time. It gives your counterpart the illusion of control - they are the one with the answers and power after all - and it does all that without giving them any idea of how constrained they are by it. ""Getting to Yes"" : 1. separate the person/emotion from the problem 2. don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want 3. work cooperatively to generate win-win options 4. establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions (See “Thinking Fast and Slow” book about System 1 and System 2.) By asking, “How am I supposed to do that?” I influenced his System 1 emotional mind into accepting that his offer wasn’t good enough. His System 2 then rationalized the situation so that it made sense to give me a better offer. System 1 is far more influential. It guides and steers our rational thoughts. System 1’s beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer. Affect your counterpart’s System 1 thinking, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. When individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. And they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of view. Tactical Empathy: Negotiation serves two functions - information gathering and behavior influencing. Negotiation is nothing more than communication with results. You get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. Reveal the surprises you are certain exist. Hold multiple hypotheses in your mind at the same time. Use all the new information to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones. Engage the process with a mindset of discovery. Extract and observe as much information as possible. This is why really smart people often have trouble being negotiators - they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything to discover. Too often people find it easier just to stick with what they believe. Using what they’ve heard or their own biases, they often make assumptions about others even before meeting them. They even ignore their own perceptions to make them conform to foregone conclusions. Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. When they’re not talking, they’re thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they’re making their arguments. Instead, focus the other person and what they have to say. Identify what your counterparts actually need and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. The latter will help you discover the former. Wants are easy to talk about. Needs imply survival, the very minimum required to make us act, and so make us vulnerable. When we radiate warmth and acceptance, conversations just seem to flow. In their backstreet haggling sessions at the spice markets in Istanbul, she approached each encounter as a fun game, so that no matter how aggressively she pushed, her smile and playful demeanor primed her merchant friends to settle on a successful outcome. A smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility. Repeat the last three words of what someone has just said. By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroring instinct and your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting. The intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.” Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. The relationship between an emotionally intelligent negotiator and their counterpart is essentially therapeutic. It duplicates that of a psychotherapist with a patient. The psychotherapist pokes and prods to understand his patient’s problems, and then turns the responses back onto the patient to get him to go deeper and change his behavior. That’s exactly what good negotiators do. Once you’ve spotted an emotion you want to highlight, label it aloud. It seems like . . . It sounds like . . . It looks like . . . Notice we said “It sounds like . . .” and not “I’m hearing that . . .” That’s because the word “I” gets people’s guard up. When you say “I,” it says you’re more interested in yourself than the other person, and it makes you take personal responsibility for the words that follow - and the offense they might cause. But when you phrase a label as a neutral statement of understanding, it encourages your counterpart to be responsive. Once you’ve thrown out a label, be quiet and listen. We all have a tendency to expand on what we’ve said. Emotions have two levels: the “presenting” behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear; beneath, the “underlying” feeling is what motivates the behavior. Labeling addresses those underlying emotions. Negative feelings should be teased out. It makes the person acknowledge their feelings rather than continuing to act out. The best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts. People have a need to say no. So don’t just hope to hear it at some point; get them to say it early. “No” is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person’s autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say “No” to your ideas, the emotions calm. Train yourself to hear “No” as something other than rejection. Rethink the word in one of its alternative - and much more real - meanings: * I am not yet ready to agree * You are making me feel uncomfortable * I do not understand * I don’t think I can afford it * I want something else * I need more information * I want to talk it over with someone else There are actually three kinds of “Yes”: Counterfeit, Confirmation, and Commitment. A counterfeit “yes” is one in which your counterpart plans on saying “no” but either feels “yes” is an easier escape route. (He said “yes” but it was designed to make me feel good enough to leave him alone.) A confirmation “yes” is generally innocent, a reflexive response to a black-or-white question. The only way to get crisis hotline callers to take action was to have them own the conversation, to believe that they were coming to these conclusions, that the voice at the other end was simply a medium for those realizations. Saying “No” gives the speaker the feeling of safety, security, and control. Use a question that prompts a “No” answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he’s in the driver’s seat. Email magic: how never to be ignored: provoke a “No” with this one-sentence email: “Have you given up on this project?” I’ve used this successfully not just in North America, but with people in two different cultures (Arabic and Chinese) famous for never saying “No.” The sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually “That’s right.” Keep talking until eventually, like clearing out a swamp, the emotions drain from the dialogue. A simple rule: never compromise time and deadline, they are the screw that pressures every deal to a conclusion. It can trick you into believing that doing a deal now is more important than getting a good deal. Good negotiators resist this urge and take advantage of it in others. Deadlines are imaginary. Having no deal is better than a bad deal. When people issue threats, they consciously or subconsciously create ambiguities and loopholes they fully intend to exploit. To gauge the level of a particular threat, we’d pay attention to how many of the four questions - What? Who? When? And how? - were addressed. Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month. Hiding your deadlines dramatically increases the risk of an impasse, because having a deadline pushes you to speed up your concessions, but the other side, thinking that it has time, will just hold out for more. When negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you’re wrong. That’s not empathy; that’s projection. The most powerful word in negotiations is “Fair.” We’re mightily swayed by how much we feel we have been respected. In the Ultimatum Game, most people make an irrational choice to let the dollar slip through their fingers rather than to accept a derisory offer, because the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money. “We just want what’s fair.” triggered feelings of defensiveness and often lead to an irrational concession. Early on in a negotiation, I say, “I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times. So please stop me at any time if you feel I’m being unfair, and we’ll address it.” It sets me up as an honest dealer. Get the other party to reveal their problems, pain, and unmet objectives, then you can sell them a vision of their problem that leaves your proposal as the perfect solution. Imagine that I offer you $20 to run a three-minute errand and get me a cup of coffee. You’re going to think to yourself that $20 for three minutes is $400 an hour. You’re going to be thrilled. What if then you find out that by getting you to run that errand I made a million dollars. You’d go from being ecstatic for making $400 an hour to being angry because you got ripped off. The value of the $20 didn’t change. But your perspective of it did. Just by how I position the $20, I can make you happy or disgusted by it. People are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. You have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through. Start out with the basics of empathy: An accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears. By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to avoid it. Let the other side anchor monetary negotiations. “Never open.” Rules like that are easy to remember, but, like most simplistic approaches, they are not always good advice. Instead of saying, “I’m worth $110,000,” Jerry might have said, “At top places like X Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.” Alluding to a range: given this range, the firm probably would have offered $130,000 because it looked so cheap next to $170,000. Job applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a “bolstering range,” in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted. Numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel like temporary placeholders, guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of. But anything you throw out that sounds less rounded - say, $37,263 - feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful calculation. Such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart, so use them to fortify your offers. Negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating. Successful negotiation involved getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself, giving him the illusion of control. The calibrated, or open-ended, question: “Hey, how do I know the hostage is all right?” The kidnapper actually went silent for ten seconds. He was completely taken aback. Then he said, “Well, I’ll put her on the phone.” He’d asked an open-ended, yet calibrated one that forced the other guy to pause and actually think about how to solve the problem. It’s a “how” question, and “how” engages because “how” asks for help. He thinks it’s his idea. Our job as persuaders is not to get others believing what we say. It’s just to stop them unbelieving. Disagree without being disagreeable: instead of telling the salesclerk what you “need,” you can describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions. Just say the price is a bit more than you budgeted and ask “How am I supposed to do that?” You really are asking for help and your delivery must convey that. Calibrated questions avoid questions that can be answered with a simple “yes” or a “no.” Instead, “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how.” Those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively. Start with “what,” “how,” and sometimes “why.” Nothing else. * What about this is important to you? * How can I help to make this better for us? * How would you like me to proceed? * What is it that brought us into this situation? * How can we solve this problem? * What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here? * How am I supposed to do that? The implication is that you want what the other guy wants but you need his intelligence to overcome the problem. If you can’t control your own emotions, how can you expect to influence the emotions of another? Bite your tongue. Keep away from knee-jerk, passionate reactions. Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? The listener, of course. The talker is revealing information while the listener is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He’s harnessing the talker’s energy for his own ends. “How” questions are gentle and graceful ways to say “No” and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution - your solution. Forced empathy: making the other side take a good look at your situation. Push your counterparts to define success their way: “How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we address things if we find we’re off track?” When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s right.” “I’ll try,” you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, “I plan to fail.” Only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face. People fall into three broad categories: 1. Accommodators 2. Assertive 3. Analysts ACCOMMODATORS: As long as they’re communicating, they’re happy. Their goal is to be on great terms with their counterpart, even if they can’t reach an agreement. If you have identified yourself as an Accommodator, do not sacrifice your objections. Be conscious of excess chitchat: the other two types have no use for it. ASSERTIVES believe time is money; every wasted minute is a wasted dollar. Getting the solution perfect isn’t as important as getting it done. Assertives love winning above all else, often at the expense of others. They focus on their own goals rather than people. And they tell rather than ask. Once they are convinced you understand them, then and only then will they listen for your point of view. ANALYSTS are methodical and diligent, working toward the best result in a thorough and systematic way, minimizing mistakes. People like this are skeptical by nature. Be prepared. Use clear data to drive your reason; don’t ad-lib; use data comparisons to disagree and focus on the facts; warn them of issues early; and avoid surprises. Thinking you’re normal is one of the most damaging assumptions in negotiations. We unconsciously project our own style on the other side. Experienced negotiators often lead with a ridiculous offer, an extreme anchor. And if you’re not prepared to handle it, you’ll lose your moorings and immediately go to your maximum. It’s human nature. “What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?” Instead of naming a price, allude to an incredibly high number that someone else might charge. Never to look at your counterpart as an enemy. The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue is. The haggling system that I use to this day: 1. Set your target price (your goal). 2. Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price. 3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent). 4. Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer. 5. When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight. 6. On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit. People getting concessions often feel better about the bargaining process than those who are given a single firm, “fair” offer, even when they end up paying more - or receiving less - than they otherwise might. You fall to your highest level of preparation. Black Swan symbolizes the uselessness of predictions based on previous experience. Black Swans are events or pieces of knowledge that sit outside our regular expectations and therefore cannot be predicted. Leverage is as a fluid that sloshes between the parties. Whenever the other side says, “I want” you have positive leverage. When they say that, you have power: you can make their desire come true; you can withhold it and thereby inflict pain; or you can use their desire to get a better deal with another party. Threats can be like nuclear bombs. There will be a toxic residue that will be difficult to clean up. Understand the other side’s worldview, their reason for being, their religion. (sometimes involving God but not always) Planned negotiating sessions are often the least revealing because these are the moments when people are at their most guarded. During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes, before you actually get down to business, and the last few moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about the other side than anything in between. That’s why reporters have a credo to never turn off their recorders: you always get the best stuff at the beginning and the end of an interview. When someone breaks ranks, people’s façades crack just a little. Simply noticing whose cracks and how others respond verbally and nonverbally can reveal a gold mine. Except for a few naturals, everyone hates negotiation at first. That’s why wimp-win deals are the norm. Get over that fear of conflict and navigate it with empathy. Don’t avoid honest, clear conflict. It will also save your marriage, your friendship, Be honest about what you want and what you can - and cannot - do.","Advanced book about negotiating. Serious hostage type stuff. For a lighter book on negotiation, read “You Can Negotiate Anything” by Herb Cohen."
Homo Deus,Yuval Noah Harari,13265096,6,"More people die today from eating too much than from eating too little. More people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. There are no longer natural famines in the world; there are only political famines. If people in Syria, Sudan or Somalia starve to death, it is because some politician wants them to. Today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you can conquer oil fields through war, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. Hence as knowledge became the most important economic resource, the profitability of war declined and wars became increasingly restricted to those parts of the world – such as the Middle East and Central Africa – where the economies are still old-fashioned material-based economies. Terrorists provoke their enemies to overreact. Terrorism is a show. Terrorists stage a terrifying spectacle of violence that captures our imagination and makes us feel as if we are sliding back into medieval chaos. Consequently states often feel obliged to react to the theatre of terrorism with a show of security, orchestrating immense displays of force, such as the persecution of entire populations or the invasion of foreign countries. In most cases, this overreaction to terrorism poses a far greater threat to our security than the terrorists themselves. Terrorists are like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. Islamic fundamentalists could never have toppled Saddam Hussein by themselves. Instead they enraged the USA by the 9/11 attacks, and the USA destroyed the Middle Eastern china shop for them. Now they flourish in the wreckage. By themselves, terrorists are weak. Because religions insisted that the meaning of our existence depended on our fate in the afterlife, they were consequently quite tolerant of death. Just try to imagine them in a world without death – which is also a world without heaven, hell or reincarnation. It is hard to believe in immortality and be proven wrong. Modern medicine hasn’t extended our natural life span. Its great achievement has been to save us from premature death, and allow us to enjoy the full measure of our years. Artistic creativity, is fuelled by the fear of death. Happiness is nothing but pleasure and freedom from pain. Beyond pleasure and pain there is no good and no evil. We never react to events in the outside world, but only to sensations in our own bodies. Nobody suffers because she lost her job. The only thing that makes people miserable is unpleasant sensations in their own bodies. Nobody is ever made happy by getting a promotion, winning the lottery or even finding true love. People are made happy by one thing and one thing only – pleasant sensations in their bodies. When an animal is looking for something that increases its chances of survival and reproduction (e.g., food, partners or social status), the brain produces sensations of alertness and excitement, which drive the animal to make even greater efforts because they are so very agreeable. Nobody would have wanted to climb mountains, play video games or go on blind dates if such activities were accompanied solely by unpleasant sensations. We can train our minds to observe carefully how all sensations constantly arise and pass. When the mind learns to see our sensations for what they are – ephemeral and meaningless vibrations – we lose interest in pursuing them. For what is the point of running after something that disappears as fast as it arises? Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. The study of history aims above all to make us aware of possibilities we don’t normally consider. We take our reality for granted, thinking it is natural, inevitable and immutable. We seldom try to shake ourselves free, and envision alternative futures. Studying history aims to loosen the grip of the past. Movements seeking to change the world often begin by rewriting history, thereby enabling people to reimagine the future. The new history will explain that ‘our present situation is neither natural nor eternal. Things were different once. Only a string of chance events created the unjust world we know today. If we act wisely, we can change that world, and create a much better one.’ The relationship between humans and animals is the best model we have for future relations between superhumans and humans. Attributing emotions to pigs doesn’t humanise them. It ‘mammalises’ them. For emotions are not a uniquely human quality. The twenty-first century will be dominated by algorithms. An algorithm is a methodical set of steps that can be used to make calculations, resolve problems and reach decisions. How exactly does a baboon calculate probabilities? The baboon’s entire body is the calculator. What we call sensations and emotions are in fact algorithms. The baboon feels hunger, he feels fear and trembling at the sight of the lion, and he feels his mouth watering at the sight of the bananas. Within a split second, he experiences a storm of sensations, emotions and desires, which is nothing but the process of calculation. The result will appear as a feeling: the baboon will suddenly feel his spirit rising, his hairs standing on end, his muscles tensing, his chest expanding, and he will inhale a big breath, and ‘Forward!’ 99 per cent of our decisions are made by the highly refined algorithms we call sensations, emotions and desires. The word ‘mammal’ comes from the Latin mamma, meaning breast. We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of so-called lower life forms, perhaps because we are about to become one. If you really understand the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul. The literal meaning of the word ‘individual’ is ‘something that cannot be divided’. Alan Turing : The Turing Test is simply a replication of a mundane test every gay man had to undergo in 1950s : can you pass for a straight man? In May 2015 New Zealand became the first country in the world to legally recognise animals as sentient beings. By humanising animals we usually underestimate animal cognition and ignore their unique abilities. Rome conquered Greece not because the Romans had larger brains or better tool-making techniques, but because they were able to cooperate more effectively. Sapiens don’t behave according to a cold mathematical logic, but rather according to a warm social logic. We are ruled by emotions. These emotions are in fact sophisticated algorithms that reflect the social mechanisms of ancient hunter-gatherer bands. Large numbers of people behave in a fundamentally different way than do small numbers. Visual marks such as a turban, a beard or a business suit to signal ‘you can trust me, I believe in the same story as you’. The intersubjective depend on communication among many humans rather than on the beliefs and feelings of individual humans. To study history means to watch the spinning and unravelling of these webs, and to realise that what seems to people in one age the most important thing in life becomes utterly meaningless to their descendants. They had difficulty remembering which estates, orchards and fields belonged to the goddess Inanna, which of Inanna’s employees had already received their salaries, which of the goddess’s tenants had failed to pay their rents and what interest rate the goddess charged her debtors. This obstacle was finally removed about 5,000 years ago, when the Sumerians invented both writing and money. In literate societies people are organised into networks, so that each person is only a small step in a huge algorithm, and it is the algorithm as a whole that makes the important decisions. Aristides de Sousa Mendes, armed with little more than a rubber stamp, was responsible for the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the Holocaust. Anyone who has ever dealt with bureaucracy knows that the truth hardly matters. What’s written on your form is far more important. Written language gradually became a powerful way to reshape reality. Many of the difficulties faced by present-day African countries stem from the fact that their borders make little sense. The borders disregard river lines, mountain ranges and trade routes, split historical and economic zones unnecessarily, and ignore local ethnic and religious identities. The same tribe may find itself riven among several countries, whereas one country may incorporate splinters of numerous rival clans. African borders don’t reflect the wishes and struggles of local nations. They were drawn by European bureaucrats who never set foot in Africa. Priests and scribes in ancient civilisations became accustomed to seeing documents as guidebooks for reality. At first, the texts told them about the reality of taxes, fields and granaries. But as the bureaucracy gained power, so the texts gained authority. Priests recorded not only lists of the god’s property, but also the god’s deeds, commandments and secrets. The resulting scriptures purported to describe reality in its entirety, and generations of scholars became accustomed to looking for all the answers in the pages of the Bible, the Qur’an or the Vedas. A five-year-old cannot understand that something important is happening for reasons unrelated to him. He is convinced that everything happens because of him. Most people grow out of this infantile delusion. Monotheists hold on to it till the day they die. Human cooperative networks usually judge themselves by yardsticks of their own invention and, not surprisingly, they often give themselves high marks. Human networks built in the name of imaginary entities such as gods, nations and corporations normally judge their success from the viewpoint of the imaginary entity. God helps those who help themselves. This is a roundabout way of saying that God doesn’t exist, but if our belief in Him inspires us to do something ourselves – it helps. Antibiotics, unlike God, help even those who don’t help themselves. They cure infections whether you believe in them or not. Religion is any all-encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy on human laws, norms and values. Liberals, communists and followers of other modern creeds dislike describing their own system as a ‘religion’, because they identify religion with superstitions and supernatural powers. In fact, it means only that they believe in some system of moral laws that wasn’t invented by humans, but that humans must nevertheless obey. In theory, both science and religion are interested above all in the truth, and because each upholds a different truth, they are doomed to clash. In fact, neither science nor religion cares that much about the truth, hence they can easily compromise, coexist and even cooperate. Religion is interested above all in order. It aims to create and maintain the social structure. Science is interested above all in power. Through research, it aims to acquire the power to cure diseases, fight wars and produce food. As individuals, scientists and priests may give immense importance to the truth; but as collective institutions, science and religion prefer order and power over truth. They therefore make good bedfellows. Modern society believes in humanist dogmas, and uses science not in order to question these dogmas, but rather in order to implement them. The entire modernity contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. Most capitalists would probably dislike the label of religion, but as religions go, capitalism can at least hold its head high. Unlike other religions that promise us pie in the sky, capitalism promises miracles here on earth – and sometimes even delivers. Much of the credit for overcoming famine and plague belongs to the ardent capitalist faith in growth. Capitalism even deserves some kudos for reducing human violence and increasing tolerance and cooperation. There are additional factors at play here, but capitalism did make an important contribution to global harmony by encouraging people to stop viewing the economy as a zero-sum game, in which your profit is my loss, and instead see it as a win–win situation, in which your profit is also my profit. This mutual-benefit approach has probably helped global harmony far more than centuries of Christian preaching about loving your neighbour and turning the other cheek. A human culture that believed it already knew everything worth knowing would not bother searching for new knowledge. This was the position of most premodern human civilisations. However, the Scientific Revolution freed humankind from this naïve conviction. The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. If bad comes to worse and science cannot hold off the deluge, engineers could still build a hi-tech Noah’s Ark for the upper caste, while leaving billions of others to drown. The belief in this hi-tech Ark is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of humankind and of the entire ecosystem. People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who believe in a heavenly afterlife should not be given nuclear weapons. Capitalism has not only managed to prevail, but also to overcome famine, plague and war. For thousands of years priests, rabbis and muftis explained that humans cannot overcome famine, plague and war by their own efforts. Then along came the bankers, investors and industrialists, and within 200 years managed to do exactly that. The modern deal offers us power, on condition that we renounce our belief in a great cosmic plan that gives meaning to life. God-fearing Syria is a far more violent place than the secular Netherlands. The antidote to a meaningless and lawless existence was provided by humanism, a revolutionary new creed that conquered the world during the last few centuries. The humanist religion worships humanity, and expects humanity to play the part that God played in Christianity and Islam, and that the laws of nature played in Buddhism and Daoism. Fundamentalists may repeat the mantra that ‘Islam is the answer’, but religions that lose touch with the technological realities of the day forfeit their ability even to understand the questions being asked. Marx and Lenin devoted more attention to understanding the technological and economic realities of their time than to scrutinising ancient texts. Numbers alone don’t count for much in history. History is often shaped by small groups of forward-looking innovators rather than by the backward-looking masses. Within myself, the seeming unity that I take for granted dissolves into a cacophony of conflicting voices, none of which is ‘my true self’. The new religions will emerge from research laboratories. Promising salvation through algorithms and genes. The idea that organisms are algorithms - that giraffes, tomatoes and human beings are just different methods for processing data - is current scientific dogma, and it is changing our world beyond recognition. Experts see the economy as a mechanism for gathering data about desires and abilities, and turning this data into decisions. The stock exchange is the fastest and most efficient data-processing system humankind has so far created.","Very interesting alternative perspective on life from a historian. Anti-religion, anti-humanism, pro-animal. Seems detached, but is quite opinionated. Much to think about, regardless. My notes here give a taste. A lot to think about."
How to Live,Sarah Bakewell,1590514831,6,"“How to live?” : This is not the same as the ethical question, “How should one live?” Writing about oneself creates a mirror in which other people recognize their own humanity. How to live a good life - meaning a correct or honorable life, but also a fully human, satisfying, flourishing one. This question drove him both to write and to read, for he was curious about all human lives, past and present. He wondered constantly about the emotions and motives behind what people did. And since he was the example closest to hand of a human going about its business, he wondered just as much about himself. In place of abstract answers, Montaigne tells us what he did in each case, and what it felt like when he was doing it. He provides all the details we need to make it real. “Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.)” Essayer: firing a pistol to see if it shoots straight. Death was a topic of which the ancients never tired. To philosophize is to learn how to die. Death is only a few bad moments at the end of life, not worth wasting any anxiety over. Retiring = leaving the mainstream of life in order to begin a new, reflective existence, of freedom, tranquillity, and leisure. To live for himself rather than for duty. Seneca repeatedly urged his fellow Romans to retire in order to “find themselves.” Salvation lies in paying full attention to nature. To see the world exactly as you did half an hour ago is impossible. Most of Montaigne’s thought consists of a series of realizations that life is not as simple as he has just made it out to be. The event benefited him in exactly the areas where it also damaged him, as happens with much early life experience. Every experience can be a learning opportunity: “a page’s prank, a servant’s blunder, a remark at table.” The child should learn to question everything: to “pass everything through a sieve and lodge nothing in his head on mere authority and trust.” Traveling is useful; so is socializing, which teaches the child to be open to others and to adapt to anyone he finds around him. Eccentricities should be ironed out early, because they make it difficult to get on with others. A perfect gentleman: independent of mind yet able to mold himself to society when necessary. Quietly withdraw cooperation. Opt out of public life rather than engaging with it. They use their friends as less a person than a sort of philosophical technique. Visualize him as an ever-present audience, in order to hold oneself to his exalted standards. Tradition in philosophy: that of the great pragmatic schools which explored such questions as how to cope with a friend’s death, how to work up courage, how to act well in morally difficult situations, and how to make the most of life. The three most famous such systems of thought were Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism: the philosophies collectively known as Hellenistic. They differed in details, but were so close in essentials as to be hard to distinguish. All the schools had the same aim: to achieve eudaimonia, thriving, relishing life, being a good person. They also agreed that the best path to eudaimonia maintaining an even keel. Epicurus required followers to leave their families and live like cult members in a private garden. Skeptics preferred to remain amid the public hurly-burly like everyone else, but with a radically altered mental attitude. Stoics were somewhere in between. Stoic and Epicurean thinkers spent much time devising techniques and thought experiments. For example: imagine that today is the last day of your life. Shifts of attitude are the purpose of many of the thought experiments. A different angle produces a different emotion. If you feel tired of everything you possess, pretend that you have lost all these things and are missing them desperately. Faced with the idea of losing something now, you realize its value. Uncontrolled emotion blurs reality as tears blur a view. This trick underlies many of the other tricks. Attend to the inner world - and thus also to the outer world. Anyone who clears their vision and lives in full awareness of the world as it is, can never be bored with life. Respond to situations in the right way. Approach this goal mainly through rehearsal and meditation. Rehearsal to carve grooves of habit. Stoics were especially keen on pitiless mental rehearsals of all the things they dreaded most. Epicureans were more inclined to turn their vision away from terrible things, to concentrate on what was positive. A Stoic behaves like a man who tenses his stomach muscles and invites an opponent to punch them. An Epicurean prefers to invite no punches, and, when bad things happen, simply to step out of the way. Montaigne found the Epicurean approach more congenial. Montaigne's trick was to absorb La Boétie into himself, as a kind of ghost or secret sharer. He might not have written the Essays had he had “someone to talk to.” He had to stage his and La Boétie’s dialogue within himself. This book he hated stimulated him as grit stimulates an oyster. Thinking, “But … but …,” and even “No! No!” It forced him to analyze his own ideas. Pyrrhonian Skepticism: “All I know is that I know nothing, and I’m not even sure about that.” Stoicism and Epicureanism teach you to prepare for life’s difficulties, to pay attention, to develop good habits of thought, and to practice therapeutic tricks on yourself. Skepticism always wants to see proof. Skepticism doubts things that other people take at face value. Skepticism says nothing in life need be taken seriously. Pyrrhonism does not even take itself seriously. Socrates’s remark: “All I know is that I know nothing.” Pyrrhonian Skepticism starts from this point, but then adds, in effect, “and I’m not even sure about that.” Having stated its one philosophical principle, it turns in a circle and gobbles itself up, leaving only a puff of absurdity. Pyrrhonians accordingly deal with all the problems life can throw at them by means of a single phrase: “I suspend judgment.” This phrase conquers all enemies; it undoes them, so that they disintegrate into atoms before your eyes. In brings mental calm. One cannot know the answer and feels it doesn’t matter, so one’s nonengagement causes no distress. Attain a condition of relaxation about everything. Pyrrho renounced the pretension of “regimenting, arranging, and fixing truth.” To every account, there appears to be opposed another account, equal to it in convincingness or lack of convincingness. He noticed himself changing an opinion from one extreme to the other, or shifting from emotion to emotion within seconds. Montaigne’s talent: being able to slip out from behind his eyes so as to gaze back upon himself with Pyrrhonian suspension of judgment. Nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judging and the judged being in continual change and motion. Become wise at our own expense. It makes everything more complicated and more interesting. He never tired of boggling his own mind. He had a deep need to be surprised by what is unique, what cannot be categorized, what is mysterious. He took pleasure in his memory lapses, for they reminded him of his failings and saved him from the error of insisting that he was always right. Question everything. Tales of animal cleverness and sensitivity demonstrated that human abilities were far from exceptional, and indeed that animals do many things better than we do. Montaigne did his thinking in a richly populated environment, full of objects, books, animals, and people. Descartes needed motionless withdrawal. Pascal sums up Montaigne’s Pyrrhonian argument, or lack of it: “He puts everything into a universal doubt, and this doubt is so widespread that it becomes carried away by its very self. That is to say, he doubts whether he doubts, and doubting even this last proposition, his uncertainty goes around in an endless and restless circle. He contradicts both those who maintain that all is uncertainty, and those who maintain it is not, because he does not want to maintain anything at all. Montaigne is “so advantageously positioned in this universal doubt that he is equally strengthened both in success and defeat.” You can feel the frustration: how can anyone fight such an opponent? Yet one must. It is a moral duty, for otherwise doubt will carry everything away like a great flood: the world as we know it, human dignity, our sanity. Montaigne hovered over Pascal’s writing as his ever-present enemy and coauthor. Skepticism makes him celebrate imperfection. On the loftiest throne in the world we are still sitting only on our own rump. At times we are as different from ourselves as we are from others. Distrust godlike ambitions. Accept that one is like everyone else, and that one carries the entire form of the human condition. Something else drives people periodically to smash their achievements to pieces. It is what Freud called the thanatos principle: the drive towards death and chaos. Those living through the present assume that things are worse than they are, because they cannot escape their local perspective. Zweig knew that Montaigne disliked preaching, yet he managed to extract a series of general rules from the Essays. The eight freedoms: Be free from vanity and pride. Be free from belief, disbelief, convictions, and parties. Be free from habit. Be free from ambition and greed. Be free from family and surroundings. Be free from fanaticism. Be free from fate; be master of your own life. Be free from death; life depends on the will of others, but death on our own will. Pyrrhonian principle: lend your ears to everyone and your mind to no one. It was not that age automatically conferred wisdom. On the contrary, he thought the old were more given to vanities and imperfections than the young. They were inclined to “a silly and decrepit pride, a tedious prattle, prickly and unsociable humors, superstition, and a ridiculous concern for riches.” By understanding that age does not make one wise, one attains a kind of wisdom after all. Answer given by the Zen master who, when asked, “What is enlightenment?” whacked the questioner on the head with a stick Enlightenment is something learned on your own body: it takes the form of things happening to you. This is why the Stoics, Epicureans, and Skeptics taught tricks rather than precepts. All philosophers can offer is that blow on the head: a useful technique, a thought experiment, or an experience.

Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit,Steven Pressfield,1936891492,6,"I tried novels but I learned practically nothing because I was alone and kept making the same mistakes over and over. It wasn’t until I got to Hollywood and began writing for the movies that I really started to understand what a story was. So when I went back to novels after that, I had a sound foundation. Nobody wants to read your shit. They’re just busy. What’s the answer? 1) Streamline your message. Focus it and pare it down to its simplest, clearest, easiest-to-understand form. 2) Make its expression fun. Or sexy or interesting or scary or informative. Make it so compelling that a person would have to be crazy NOT to read it. 3) Apply that to all forms of writing or art or commerce. When you understand that nobody wants to read your shit, you develop empathy. You acquire the skill that is indispensable to all artists and entrepreneurs - the ability to switch back and forth in your imagination from your own point of view as writer/painter/seller to the point of view of your reader/gallery-goer/customer. You learn to ask yourself with every sentence and every phrase: Is this interesting? Is it fun or challenging or inventive? Am I giving the reader enough? If you want real credit, you have to write a script on your own and have a hit on your own. It isn’t enough to catch the reader’s eye. You can do that with cute kittens or a wet T-shirt. You also have to sell the product. There must be a message, and that message must stick. It must have meaning in terms of the product. It must make the reader/ viewer think, “Hmm, that makes sense,” or, “Hmm, I like that.” Come up with a concept. A concept takes a conventional claim and puts a spin on it. A concept establishes a frame of referenc - e a context that makes the viewer behold the product with fresh eyes. Avis Rent a Car’s “We’re #2 so we try harder.” Every work of art is founded on a concept. A diet should have a concept. An invasion of a foreign country should have a concept. A high-concept movie is a film 1) whose narrative idea can be communicated in ten seconds or less and 2) as soon as you hear the idea, you can imagine all the cool scenes that are certain to be in the movie At the inception of any project I ask myself, “What is the concept?” I won’t tackle anything until I know the concept. Shut up and let the professional do her work. Med opened a huge flat file drawer and began poring through magazines and photography books. I asked him what he was doing. “Stealing.” It ain’t stealing if you put a spin on it. A fake writer (or artist or entrepreneur) is just trying to draw attention to himself. THE HERO’S JOURNEY 1) Hero starts in Ordinary World. 2) Hero receives Call to Adventure. 3) Hero rejects Call. 4) Hero meets Mentor. Mentor gives hero courage to accept Call. 5) Hero crosses Threshold, enters Special World. 6) Hero encounters enemies and allies, undergoes ordeal that will serve as his Initiation. 7) Hero confronts Villain, acquires Treasure. 8) The Road Back. Hero escapes Special World, trying to “get home.” 9) Villains pursue Hero. Hero must fight/escape again. 10) Hero returns home with Treasure, reintegrates into Ordinary World, but now as a changed person, thanks to his ordeal and experiences on his journey. Cue up any movie from Casablanca to The Martian, including films with seemingly rulebook-defying structures like Pulp Fiction or Charlie Kaufman’s Adaptation. At the heart of each, in one form or another, you will find the hero’s journey. Every convention in every genre is a station in that genre’s version of the hero’s journey. A book or movie that works is undergirded by a theme. Nothing in that book or movie is not on-theme. Start at the end. Begin with the climax, then work backward to the beginning. This back-to-front method. It works for anything - novels, plays, new-business pitches, music albums, choreography. First figure out where you want to finish. Then work backward to set up everything you need to get you there. “On the nose.” This is the most heinous crime a movie writer can commit. Dialogue that is “on the nose” expresses exactly what is being portrayed non-verbally by the actors. I never wrote anything good until I stopped trying to write the truth. I never had any real fun either. Truth is not the truth. Fiction is the truth. Write nonfiction as if it were a novel. Give it an Act One, an Act Two, an Act Three. Make it cohere around a theme. Give it a hero, and make that hero embody the theme. Give it a villain, and make that villain stand for the counter-theme. Make the narrative build to a climax, and have that climax resolve the conflict of the narrative in terms of the theme. I‘ll do between ten and fifteen drafts of every book I write. Most writers do. Thinking in multiple drafts takes the pressure off. If we know we’re going to do fifteen drafts before we’re done, we don’t panic when Draft #6 is still a mess. “Relax, we’ve got nine more tries to make it work.” Organize your material (even though it’s technically not a story and not fiction) as if it were a story and as if it were fiction. The universal principles of storytelling: 1) Every story must have a concept. It must put a unique and original spin, twist or framing device upon the material. 2) Every story must be about something. It must have a theme. 3) Every story must have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Act One, Act Two, Act Three. 4) Every story must have a hero. 5) Every story must have a villain. 6) Every story must start with an Inciting Incident, embedded within which is the story’s climax. 7) Every story must escalate through Act Two in terms of energy, stakes, complication and significance/meaning as it progresses. 8) Every story must build to a climax centered around a clash between the hero and the villain that pays off everything that came before and that pays it off on-theme. the universal structural elements of all stories? Hook. Build. Payoff. This is the shape any story must take. A beginning that grabs the listener. A middle that escalates in tension, suspense, stakes, and excitement. And an ending that brings it all home with a bang. Shawn Coyne edited and published (and titled) “THE WAR OF ART” The hero of The War of Art is the reader. The villain is Resistance.

Living Beautifully with Uncertainty and Change,Pema Chödrön,1611802725,6,"Repression or acting out: they’re equally harmful. Once you speak or act, other people’s emotions become involved. If you repress your feelings, everyone is affected by that too, because you’re like a keg of dynamite that’s about to go off. Refraining from speaking or acting out slows us down and enables us to see our habitual responses very, very clearly. Until we can see our reactions, we can never know precisely what causes us to stay stuck and what will help us to get free. Don’t believe everything you think. We’re either speaking or acting in order to escape, or we’re not. Don’t speak or act out. Period. By training with everyday irritations, we develop the knack of refraining when the going gets rough. When the urge comes on it’s irresistible. The seduction is too strong. Refraining from harmful speech and action is outer renunciation; choosing not to escape the underlying feelings is inner renunciation. Unless I also include inner renunciation and admit to the ways I’m propping myself up by building this virtuous identity, then simply following the rules can be just another way of shoring up my self-image as a virtuous person, as someone who’s purer than others. The basic instruction of the first commitment: Don’t act, don’t speak. That’s the outer work. And then there’s also the inner work of exploring what happens next when you don’t act and don’t speak. When you’re refraining - when you’re feeling the pull of habitual thoughts and emotions but you’re not escaping by acting or speaking out - you can try this inner renunciation exercise: Notice how you feel: What does it feel like in the body to have these cravings or aggressive urges? Notice your thinking: What sort of thoughts do these feelings give birth to? Notice your actions: How do you treat yourself and other people when you feel this way? Commitment to sanity: refrain from something you habitually do to escape. It will put you in touch with the underlying anxiety or uncertainty that you’ve been avoiding. Sojong takes place twice a month, on the full and new moon days. The day before, each person reviews the preceding two weeks and reflects: What have I done with my body? What have I done with my speech? What about my mind: is it steady or all over the place and never present? This gives us an opportunity to reflect on where we are in terms of refraining and, when we feel that we’ve really made a mess of things, to put that behind us and start anew. Instead of holding on to the view, “I’m hopeless. Week after week, month after month, year after year go by, and I can never stop lying” (or whatever your habit is), you can say, “Well, this is where I am now. I fully declare what’s happened now and in the past, and I go forward with a sense of a fresh start.” You can always connect with your true nature at any time and be free of everything that went before. Practice meditation to nurture the natural ability of the mind to be present, to feel loving-kindness, to open beyond fixed opinions and views. How easily we’re distracted and become lost in planning and remembering, escaping into thoughts and daydreams. Label the thoughts, let them go, and come back to the here and now. First, contemplate your intention for this practice session. Mindfulness means paying attention to all the details of your life, from how we make dinner to how we speak to one another to how we take care of our clothes, our floors. We’re either present when putting on our sweater or tying our shoes or brushing our teeth, or we’re not. We’re either awake or asleep, conscious or distracted. Contemplate what you do when you’re unhappy or dissatisfied and want to feel better. Does it work? Has it ever worked? Reputation is about as flimsy as a child’s sand castle. Up the mountain at the retreat center I was nobody. Down the mountain at the teaching I was a special guest, worthy of respect. But these were just shifting, ambiguous labels. I couldn’t ever be labeled definitively. Awakening is not a process of building ourselves up but a process of letting go. It’s a process of relaxing in the middle - the paradoxical, ambiguous middle, full of potential, full of new ways of thinking and seeing - with absolutely no money-back guarantee of what will happen next. When we set out to support other beings, when we go so far as to stand in their shoes, when we aspire to never close down to anyone, we quickly find ourselves in the uncomfortable territory of “life not on my terms.” Move consciously into the pain of the world in order to help alleviate it. Invite all sentient beings to be our guest. Opening our door to everyone, not just to the people we like. Saying to myself when I wake up, “I wonder what will happen today.” That’s the spirit of taking a leap. Continually ask ourselves: How can I be of service? When we feel uneasy, we tend to become very opinionated and cling to our views, trying to get rid of that shaky, edgy feeling. Leonard Cohen once said about the benefits of many years of meditation, “The less there was of me, the happier I got.” You have to decide for yourself what gives you inner strength, what minimizes your confusion, what helps you get unstuck, what brings you closer to experiencing life without a story line. Reach the point where there’s nothing you can’t deal with, nothing you can’t work with. There are those fortunate few who seem to consider everything an adventure, no matter how challenging or painful it is, but most of us don’t view life that way. And if someone suggests that our suffering is a great opportunity for practice, we’re not likely to take it kindly. It’s built into our DNA that when things are unpleasant and fearful, we look for the nearest exit. If we find ourselves in a burning building, we instinctively head for the door. When I first started to approach life with a more warrior-like spirit, I was dying for something to go wrong so I would have something really juicy to work with. But I soon discovered that as keen as I was for my propensities to arise so that I could free myself from them, when it happened - when the dog got its teeth in my arm - it was very humbling. I felt deep compassion for what we’re up against as human beings. Look at it as if for the last time. If you knew you were going to die in a few minutes. Very open, very receptive, to everything that happened in those minutes - the sights, the sounds, the feelings of your final moments. You need a raft to get across the river, but when you arrive at the other shore, you leave the raft behind. You don’t lug it around with you forever. My job was to make sure that the meditation hall was running smoothly, that everything was on schedule. I would be so pleased when everything was working like clockwork - and then Chögyam Trungpa would throw us off completely. If the regular afternoon talk was scheduled for 3:00 P.M., he would arrive at 3:00 on the first day, he would arrive at 4:00 the next day, and then on the third day, he would keep us waiting until 5:00. By the fourth talk, we were waiting until 10:00 P.M. Talk about groundlessness! The practice department didn’t know how to set up a schedule. The cooks didn’t know when to serve meals. After a while, we almost weren’t sure if it was day or night. This turned out to be the best sort of training possible for embracing the fundamental ambiguity of the human condition.",Everything she writes is wonderful. All a similar theme. See the other books here for other (maybe better) examples.
Give and Take,Adam M. Grant,0143124986,6,"Givers and takers differ in their attitudes and actions toward other people. If you’re a taker, you help others strategically, when the benefits to you outweigh the personal costs. If you’re a giver, you help whenever the benefits to others exceed the personal costs. Alternatively, you might not think about the personal costs at all, helping others without expecting anything in return. If you’re a giver at work, you simply strive to be generous in sharing your time, energy, knowledge, skills, ideas, and connections with other people who can benefit from them. Being a giver doesn’t require extraordinary acts of sacrifice. It just involves a focus on acting in the interests of others. Outside the workplace, this type of behavior is quite common. Professionally, matchers operate on the principle of fairness: when they help others, they protect themselves by seeking reciprocity. If you’re a matcher, you believe in tit for tat, and your relationships are governed by even exchanges of favors. Research demonstrates that givers sink to the bottom of the success ladder. Going out of their way to help others prevented them from getting their own work done. They're too willing to sacrifice their own interests for the benefit of others. The worst performers and the best performers are givers; takers and matchers are more likely to land in the middle. People tend to envy successful takers and look for ways to knock them down a notch. In contrast, when givers win, people are rooting for them and supporting them. Givers succeed in a way that creates a ripple effect, enhancing the success of people around them. “Being a giver is not good for a 100-yard dash, but it’s valuable in a marathon .” Our grandparents worked in jobs producing goods, and didn’t need to collaborate with other people, so it was fairly inefficient to be a giver. But now, a high percentage of people work in interconnected jobs providing services to others. The service sector places a premium on providers who have established relationships and reputations as givers. When they anticipate self-interested behavior from others, people fear that they’ll be exploited if they operate like givers, so they conclude that pursuing a competitive orientation is the rational and appropriate thing to do. “I get to create an environment where other people can get deals and build relationships, and I live in the world I want to live in.” If you’ve ever put your guard up when meeting a new colleague, it’s probably because you thought you picked up on the scent of self-serving motives. When we see a taker coming, we protect ourselves by closing the door to our networks, withholding our trust and help. To avoid getting shut out, many takers become good fakers, acting generously so that they can waltz into our networks disguised as givers or matchers. Ultimatum: he acts like a taker, keeping $8 and offering you only $2. What do you do? Why do we punish takers for being unfair? It’s not spite. We’re not getting revenge on takers for trying to take advantage of us. It’s about justice. If you’re a matcher, you’ll also punish takers for acting unfairly toward other people. Gossip represents a widespread, efficient, and low-cost form of punishment. If we create networks with the sole intention of getting something, we won’t succeed. We can’t pursue the benefits of networks ; the benefits ensue from investments in meaningful activities and relationships. Self-glorifying images, self-absorbed conversations, and sizable pay gaps can send accurate, reliable signals that someone is a taker. The takers also had significantly more Facebook friends, racking up superficial connections so they could advertise their accomplishments and stay in touch to get favors. Rifkin gives more than five times as much as he gets: on LinkedIn, he has written detailed recommendations for 265 different people. The reciprocity norm can leave a bad taste, feeling more like a transaction than part of a meaningful relationship. Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges. Our strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do. Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network. The opposite of paranoia: pronoia. “the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-being, or saying nice things about you behind your back.” The older we get, the more dormant ties we have, and the more valuable they become. Today, Adam Rifkin spends less time networking with new people than he did earlier in his career, focusing instead on a growing number of dormant ties. “Now my time is spent going back to people who I haven’t talked to in a while.” His giving is governed by a simple rule: the five-minute favor. “You should be willing to do something that will take you five minutes or less for anybody.” Despite being held in the highest esteem, the givers faced a problem: they paid a productivity price. When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; when we treat him as if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be. Distinguishes between geniuses and genius makers: Geniuses tend to be takers: to promote their own interests, they “drain intelligence, energy, and capability” from others. Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their “intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities” of other people. Surgeons didn’t get better with practice. They only got better at the specific hospital where they practiced. They weren’t getting better at performing coronary artery bypass grafts. They were becoming more familiar with particular nurses and anesthesiologists, learning about their strengths and weaknesses, habits, and styles. Americans see independence as a symbol of strength, viewing interdependence as a sign of weakness. How givers collaborate: they take on the tasks that are in the group’s best interest, not necessarily their own personal interests. Jonas Salk made the same mistake as Frank Lloyd Wright: he saw himself as independent rather than interdependent. Then he was penalized by his colleagues for taking sole credit. We have more access to information about our own contributions than the contributions of others. We see all of our own efforts, but we only witness a subset of our partners’ efforts. People tend to overvalue their own contributions and undervalue those of others. This is responsibility bias. Frank Lloyd Wright never “stood behind one and helped him up.” “You do a good job building your buildings in keeping with your ideal. But you have been weak in your support of others in their desire for this same attainment.” The bloomers weren’t any smarter than their peers - the difference “was in the mind of the teacher.” Some students who were randomly labeled as bloomers achieved more than 50 percent intelligence gains in a single year. The trainees randomly labeled as high-potentials did significantly better. When the platoon leaders believed in the trainees’ potential, they acted in ways that made this potential a reality. The platoon leaders who held high expectations of their trainees provided more help, career advice, and feedback to their trainees. When their trainees made mistakes, instead of assuming that they lacked ability, the platoon leaders saw opportunities for teaching and learning. He met with each of the auditors and informed them that they were hired after a highly competitive selection process, management had high expectations for their success, and they had the skills to overcome challenges and be successful. Three weeks later, McNatt sent them a letter reinforcing this message. For a full month, the auditors who received McNatt’s message earned higher performance ratings. Raymond Cattell developed an investment theory of intelligence. He proposed that interest is what drives people to invest their time and energy in developing particular skills and bases of knowledge. Today, we have compelling evidence that interest precedes the development of talent. It turns out that motivation is the reason that people develop talent in the first place. In the 1980s, the psychologist Benjamin Bloom led a landmark study of world-class musicians, scientists, and athletes. They discovered an unexpected absence of raw talent. The study showed that early on most of the star pianists seemed “special only when comparing one child with others in the family or neighborhood.” They didn’t stand out on a local, regional, or national level - and they didn’t win many early competitions. Another surprise: The pianists didn’t start out learning from piano teachers who were experts. They typically took their first piano lessons with a teacher who lived nearby in their neighborhoods. The pianists gained their advantage by practicing many more hours than their peers. When the pianists and their parents talked about their first piano teachers, they consistently focused on one theme: the teachers were caring, kind, and patient. The pianists looked forward to piano lessons because their first teachers made music interesting and fun. The world-class pianists had their initial interest sparked by teachers who were givers. “Setting high expectations is so important. You have to push people, make them stretch and do more than they think possible. When they take my tests, I want them thinking it was the toughest exam they’ve ever seen in their lives. It makes them better learners.” To encourage effort, he gives them a half dozen past exams for practice. “They need to make a significant investment, and it pays off. Forcing them to work harder than they ever have in their lives benefits them in the long run.” By making themselves vulnerable, givers can actually build prestige. But there’s a twist: expressing vulnerability is only effective if the audience receives other signals establishing the speaker’s competence. When the average candidate was clumsy, audiences liked him even less. But when the expert was clumsy, audiences liked him even more. Psychologist James Pennebaker calls this the joy of talking: the more you talked, the more you like the group. The more you talk, the more you think you’ve learned about the group. By talking like a taker and dominating the conversation, you believe you’ve actually come to know the people around you, even though they barely spoke. Communicating our thoughts is a supremely enjoyable learning experience. He speaks softly and asks me some basic questions before he even pulls out a single tray of sunglasses from the case. Have I ever been here before? Do I have a prescription to fill? What’s my lifestyle like - do I play sports? He listens carefully to my answers and gives me some space to contemplate. He had the single highest giver score of any employee in the company. He was also the top-selling optician in the entire company. Expert negotiators spent much more time trying to understand the other side’s perspective: questions made up over 21 percent of the experts’ comments. We just want to make our own free choices, rather than having our decisions controlled by someone else. So if I tell you to go out and vote, you might resist. But when I ask if you’re planning to vote, you don’t feel like I’m trying to influence you. It’s an innocent query, and instead of resisting my influence, you reflect on it. “Well, I do care about being a good citizen, and I want to support my candidate.” This doesn’t feel like I’m persuading you. As Aronson explains, you’ve been convinced by someone you already like and trust: Yourself. By asking people questions about their plans and intentions, we increase the likelihood that they actually act on these plans and intentions. I ask about your plans to do something undesirable, questions don’t work. For example, are you planning to eat some chocolate-covered grasshoppers this month? After thinking about it, you’re probably even less likely to do it. When givers ask for advice, it’s because they’re genuinely interested in learning from others. Matchers hold back on advice seeking for a different reason: they might owe something in return. When we give our time, energy, knowledge, or resources to help others, we strive to maintain a belief that they’re worthy and deserving of our help. Seeking advice is a subtle way to invite someone to make a commitment to us. As Benjamin Franklin wrote in his autobiography, “He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.” People love to be asked for advice. Selfless givers are people with high other-interest and low self-interest. They give their time and energy without regard for their own needs, and they pay a price for it. Selfless giving is a form of pathological altruism. “An unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers end up harming themselves. Bill Gates argued at the World Economic Forum, “there are two great forces of human nature : self-interest, and caring for others.” Giver burnout: it has less to do with the amount of giving and more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving. We believed that compassion fatigue was caused by expressing too much compassion. But they burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively. Attaching a single patient’s photo to a CT exam increased diagnostic accuracy by 46 percent. And roughly 80 percent of the key diagnostic findings came only when the radiologists saw the patient’s photo. When the radiologists saw the patient’s photo, they felt more empathy. By encouraging empathy, the photos motivated the radiologists to conduct their diagnoses more carefully. Their reports were 29 percent longer when the CT exams included patient photos. When people know how their work makes a difference, they feel energized to contribute more. when people give continually without concern for their own well-being, they’re at risk for poor mental and physical health. Yet when they give in a more otherish fashion, demonstrating substantial concern for themselves as well as others, they no longer experience health costs. Happiness increased when people performed all five giving acts in a single day, rather than doing one a day. Spreading them over the course of a week might have diminished their salience and power or made them less distinguishable from participants’ habitual kind behavior.. Turning these selfless givers into otherish givers: instead of sprinkling their giving, they could chunk it. Create dedicated windows for quiet time and interaction time. Burnout didn’t decrease effort across the board. One place where it actually increased their effort when they felt burned out: helping others. When the firefighters experienced signs of burnout, they were more likely to go out of their way to help colleagues with heavy workloads, share new knowledge with supervisors, give advice to newer colleagues, and even listen to colleagues’ problems. why many takers and matchers started giving on Freecycle. It’s an efficient way to get rid of things they don’t want and probably can’t sell on Craigslist. But soon, Beal knows from personal experience, people who initially give things away for selfish reasons begin to care about the people they’re helping. Recruited fans of the Manchester United soccer team for a study. When walking from one building to another, the soccer fans saw a runner slip on a grass bank, where he fell holding his ankle and screaming in pain. Would they help him? It depended on the T-shirt that he was wearing. When he wore a plain T-shirt, only 33 percent helped. When he wore a Manchester United T-shirt, 92 percent helped. If we help people who belong to our group, we’re also helping ourselves, as we’re making the group better off.","If you feel you are too generous, or too greedy, or are wary and insist on reciprocation, consider reading this research-based look at the subject of these different personality types. Counter-intuitive findings."
The Bed of Procrustes,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,1400069971,6,"An idea is interesting when you get scared of taking it to its logical conclusion. Pharmaceutical companies are inventing diseases that match existing drugs. Losing all your fortune is much less painful than losing only half. When we want to do something while unconsciously certain to fail, we seek advice so we can blame someone else for the failure. Never say no twice if you mean it. Your reputation is harmed the most by what you say to defend it. The definition of aging is when a person starts to talk about aging. Humility is successfully disguised arrogance. “Temporary” arrangements are permanent. “Permanent” ones are temporary. The loser bemoans mankind’s flaws and irrationality instead of exploiting them for fun and profit. The opposite of manliness is technology. The appearance of inconsistency makes people attractive. You remember emails you sent that were not answered better than emails that you did not answer. Friendship that ends was never one. Most people fear being without audiovisual stimulation because they are too repetitive when they think and imagine things on their own. You exist only if you are free to do things without objective, with no justification, outside the dictatorship of someone else’s narrative. The book is the only medium left that hasn’t been corrupted by the profane: everything else on your eyelids manipulates you with an ad. The opposite of success is name-dropping. You don’t become completely free by just avoiding to be a slave; you also need to avoid becoming a master. “Wasting time” is most often the best investment. Decline starts with the replacement of dreams with memories. The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor. The fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich. You will be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt. Someone who says “I am busy” is either declaring incompetence (and lack of control of his life) or trying to get rid of you. You are rich if money you refuse tastes better than money you accept. You like where you are if you are as happy returning as you were leaving. People focus on role models; it is more effective to find antimodels - people you don’t want to resemble when you grow up. It is as difficult to change someone’s opinions as it is to change his tastes. In most debates, people seem to be trying to convince one another; but all they can hope for is new arguments to convince themselves. The most unsuccessful people give the most advice. There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. People usually apologize so they can do it again. If someone gives you more than one reason why he wants the job, don’t hire him. Social networks would be more informative if people described what they don’t like. People are so prone to overcausation that you can make the reticent turn loquacious by dropping an occasional “why?” in the conversation. A truly independent thinker may look like an accountant. Do not compete with anyone in any of your pursuits. Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura. We are satisfied with natural (or old) objects like vistas or classical paintings but insatiable with technologies. Most modern efficiencies are deferred punishment. Use boredom in place of a clock, as a biological wristwatch. For pleasure, read one chapter. For punishment, two. It is much less dangerous to think like a man of action than to act like a man of thought. We unwittingly amplify commonalities with friends, dissimilarities with strangers, and contrasts with enemies. Unless we manipulate our surroundings, we have as little control over what and whom we think about as we do over the muscles of our hearts. The fool views himself as more unique and others more generic; the wise views himself as more generic and others more unique. Medieval man was a cog in a wheel he did not understand; modern man is a cog in a complicated system he thinks he understands. Knowledge is reached (mostly) by removing junk from people’s heads. Most people need to wait for another person to say “this is beautiful art”. Some need to wait for two or more. We are most motivated to help those who need us the least. Meditation is a way to be narcissistic without hurting anyone. You can only convince people who think they can benefit from being convinced. You may outlive your strength, never your wisdom. There are those who will thank you for what you gave them, and others who will blame you for what you did not give them. The nation-state: apartheid without political incorrectness. When conflicted between two choices, take neither. Nation-states like war; city-states like commerce; families like stability; and individuals like entertainment. Robust is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who dislike it. The best test of robustness to reputational damage is your emotional state (fear, joy, boredom) when you get an email from a journalist. IQ, SAT, and school grades are tests designed by nerds so they can get high scores in order to call each other intelligent. A prophet is not someone with special visions, just someone blind to most of what others see. To be a philosopher is to know through long walks, by reasoning, and reasoning only, a priori, what others can only potentially learn from their mistakes, crises, accidents, Conscious ignorance expands your world. Those who have nothing to prove never say that they have nothing to prove. A verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence. You often prefer those who find you interesting over those you find interesting. The Internet broke the private-public wall; impulsive and inelegant utterances that used to be kept private are now available for literal interpretation. We expect places and products to be less attractive than in marketing brochures, but we never forgive humans for being worse than their first impressions. If my detractors knew me better they would hate me even more. The poet Georges Schéhadé, his poetry reads like proverbs. The aphorism has been somewhat debased (outside the German language) by its association with witticism, such as the ones by Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, or Sacha Guitry. Deep thought can be poetic and witty, as with Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, or (sometimes) Wittgenstein; but, abiding by the distinction between Sacred and Profane, philosophy and poetry are not stand-up comedy.","I'm thrilled if I get a few counter-intuitive thought-provoking ideas from any source. This book is filled with his usual cocktail party sprezzatura bravado, but refreshingly succinct, minus his usual blowhard explanations of his superior scholarly approach to life."
Making Ideas Happen,Scott Belsky,1591844118,6,"Many claim they create solely for themselves. But this argument is selfish: an idea executed for an audience of one is an awful waste of potential inspiration and value for the greater good. Making ideas happen = (the idea) + organization and execution + forces of community + leadership capability Creativity x Organization = impact Someone who has loads of ideas but is so disorganized that no one particular idea is ever fully realized. 100 X 0 = 0. Someone with half the creativity and just a little more organizational ability would make a great deal more impact: 50 X 2 = 100 The equation helps us understand why some “less-creative” artists might produce more work than their talented and inventive peers. A shocking and perhaps unfortunate realization emerges: someone with average creativity but stellar organizational skills will make a greater impact than the disorganized creative geniuses Thomas Kinkade and James Patterson employ many people to assist in the production and distribution of their work. Before authoring his first novel, Patterson was the CEO of J. Walter Thompson, one of the world’s top ad agencies. Climbing the ladder to CEO, he developed the strengths as a leader and organizer that have distinguished his performance as a writer. Regardless of what the critics say, Patterson makes ideas happen at an almost alarming rate. Brainstorming sessions often yield disappointing results. Ideas with great potential fade from the participants’ minds with each additional idea thrown into the mix. Strong possibilities are trumped by alternative - not necessarily better - possibilities. A surplus of ideas is as dangerous as a drought. The tendency to jump from idea to idea to idea spreads your energy horizontally rather than vertically. Approach every occasion of creativity with a dose of skepticism and a bias toward action. For each idea, you must capture and highlight your “Action Steps.” Each person needs to “own” their Action Steps. Taking and organizing extensive notes aren’t worth the effort. Everything is a project. Breaking each one down into its primary components: Action Steps, References, and Backburner Items.",The full title - “Making Ideas Happen: Overcoming the Obstacles Between Vision and Reality” - describes its contents perfectly. Great book on that subject.
A Short History of Nearly Everything,Bill Bryson,0767908171,6,"Because gravity holds planets in orbit and makes falling objects land with a bang, we tend to think of it as a powerful force, but it is not really. It is only powerful in a kind of collective sense, when one massive object, like the Sun, holds on to another massive object, like the Earth. At an elemental level gravity is extraordinarily unrobust. Each time you pick up a book from a table or a dime from the floor you effortlessly overcome the combined gravitational exertion of an entire planet. When we die our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere - as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew. Atoms, however, go on practically forever. Earth’s surface is made up of eight to twelve big plates and twenty or so smaller ones, and they all move in different directions and at different speeds. They bear only an incidental relationship to the landmasses that sit upon them. Iceland is split down the middle, which makes it tectonically half American and half European. New Zealand, meanwhile, is part of the immense Indian Ocean plate Kazakhstan was once attached to Norway and New England. One corner of Staten Island, but only a corner, is European. So is part of Newfoundland. Pick up a pebble from a Massachusetts beach, and its nearest kin will now be in Africa. The Scottish Highlands and much of Scandinavia are substantially American. Some of the Shackleton Range of Antarctica, it is thought, may once have belonged to the Appalachians of the eastern U.S. California will float off and become a kind of Madagascar of the Pacific. Africa will push northward into Europe, squeezing the Mediterranean out of existence. Europe and North America are parting at about the speed a fingernail grows. At any one moment 1,800 thunderstorms are in progress around the globe - some 40,000 a day. Day and night across the planet every second about a hundred lightning bolts hit the ground. In 1742 Anders Celsius, made boiling point zero and freezing point 100 on his scale, but that was soon reversed. The first International Cloud Atlas produced in 1896, divided clouds into ten basic types, of which the plumpest and most cushiony-looking was number nine, cumulonimbus. That seems to have been the source of the expression “to be on cloud nine.” When you look at a lake, you are looking at a collection of molecules that have been there on average for about a decade. In the ocean the residence time is thought to be more like a hundred years. About 60 percent of water molecules in a rainfall are returned to the atmosphere within a day or two. Once evaporated, they spend no more than a week or so - Drury says twelve days - in the sky before falling again as rain. The Gulf Stream carries an amount of heat to Europe which is why Britain and Ireland have such mild winters compared with Canada and Russia. Seawater: we sweat and cry seawater, but curiously we cannot tolerate it as an input. Life occurs just for its own sake. What’s life to a lichen? Yet its impulse to exist, to be, is every bit as strong as ours - arguably even stronger. If I were told that I had to spend decades being a furry growth on a rock in the woods, I believe I would lose the will to go on. Lichens don’t. Like virtually all living things, they will suffer any hardship, endure any insult, for a moment’s additional existence. Plankton created their shells by drawing oxygen from the atmosphere and combining it with other elements (carbon especially) to form durable compounds such as calcium carbonate. Plankton take to the grave with them are two very stable isotopes - oxygen-16 and oxygen-18. The isotopes accumulate at different rates depending on how much oxygen or carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere at the time of their creation. By comparing these ancient ratios, the geochemists can cunningly read conditions in the ancient world - oxygen levels, air and ocean temperatures, the extent and timing of ice ages, and much else. By combining their isotope findings with other fossil residues - pollen levels and so on - scientists can, with considerable confidence, re-create entire landscapes that no human eye ever saw. 99.99 percent of all species that have ever lived are no longer with us. “To a first approximation, all species are extinct.” There were guinea pigs the size of rhinos and rhinos the size of a two-story house. The raccoon family migrated to South America, discovered a vacancy, and evolved into creatures the size and ferocity of bears. A gigantic, flightless, carnivorous bird called Titanis was possibly the most ferocious creature in North America. Certainly it was the most daunting bird that ever lived. It stood ten feet high, weighed over eight hundred pounds. Museum displays are artificial. Antique models, not ancient bones. Kevin Kelly, cofounder of Wired magazine, launched an enterprise called the All Species Foundation with the aim of finding every living organism and recording it on a database. The large flightless New Zealand bird called the takahe had been presumed extinct for two hundred years before being found living in a rugged area of the country’s South Island. They could insert human DNA into certain cells of flies, and the flies would accept it as if it were their own. Over 60 percent of human genes, it turns out, are fundamentally the same as those found in fruit flies. At least 90 percent correlate at some level to those found in mice. Researchers found that whatever organism they were working on - whether nematode worms or human beings - they were often studying essentially the same genes. Life, it appeared, was drawn up from a single set of blueprints. We are even quite closely related to fruit and vegetables. About half the chemical functions that take place in a banana are fundamentally the same as the chemical functions that take place in you. It cannot be said too often: all life is one. That is, and I suspect will forever prove to be, the most profound true statement there is. In Java, a team led by Ralph von Koenigswald studying the Solo People from the Solo River at Ngandong. He had offered locals ten cents for every piece of hominid bone they could come up with, then discovered to his horror that they had been enthusiastically smashing large pieces into small ones to maximize their income.",Fun read of everything from the big bang to tectonic plates to the evolution of early man.
Ikigai,Sebastian Marshall,B006M9T8NI,6,"I'm not going to compare myself against people my age any more. I'm going to start comparing myself to the greatest men of all time. Suddenly I was not doing excellent; in fact, I was behind schedule. A clear understanding of cause and effect: the outcomes of different actions. You might think ""trust"" is a good ethic, and if you trust people, things will work out. However, you discover that people either forget or lie. So you make contracts and operating agreements, and you see that people then refer back them later, and things are better. Why not be a hedonist? Because really, who gives a shit about having more serotonin and dopamine in your brain? You need enough low happiness to function. It's as important as having good respiration or circulation. Without enough low happiness, you stop functioning well. The Japanese view of work, or the Vietnamese view of the value of life: I didn't even realize that I had the American view of work. I thought that was just the way things are, not just how my culture does it. Everyone thinks their culture is ""the way things are."" Studying history to learn what's possible. Study other cultures that have goals other than happiness. Imagine you wouldn't experience any pleasant or unpleasant emotions and would have to decide rationally what to pursue. Then what you want to do with your life? He's got 10 billion dollars? Why does he need so much? Rarely do people who found nations care about what's in their belly. They wouldn't reach the height of greatness if they did. When someone eats, sleeps, breathes, walks, works, lives with one purpose, he will usually achieve that purpose. Normal people can't understand this. People with mixed and conflicted goals can't understand this. And occasionally they try to position themselves between the single-minded person and his goal. This usually ends in tragedy for the normal person. By doing an action repeatedly, eventually you become the kind of person who does that action. High born people expect to be treated well. Low born people frequently expect to be treated poorly. And thus, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you grow up watching people snap to attention and treat your parents well, you expect it. Thus, paradoxically, you become kinder, friendlier, and less adversarial. High born people tend to have a an expectation that the situation will work out favorably for them, that people will do right by them, and that they're going to get what they want. Thus, they do. Low born people frequently have an expectation that the situation is going to go poorly, that people do wrong by them, and that they're not going to get what they want. Thus, they don't. Someone who is successful or was raised by successful parents is more likely to do you a favor, introduce you to someone, or otherwise help you out. Low born people tend to be more paranoid and stingy about everything. High born people don't look to get paid back immediately. They know that you help people who seem friendly with a good character, and a lot of them will do right by you someday, sooner or later. Pursue wealth and power. These are virtuous things, and there are unlimited amounts of them available. The victors are the ones who are most patient, who are most rational, who have the most self-control. You can win 10,000 battles, but have it all undone in one rash misstep. Patience means restraining one's inclinations. There are seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, love, grief, fear, and hate, and if a man does not give way to these he can be called patient. Do things for reasons. This is not the way most people run their lives. Most people's daily lives are done out of custom, with no carefully evaluated and explicitly defined reasons for their actions. The way to start doing that is to ask, ""What is my objective here?"" Then, ""What course of action makes me most likely to reach that objective?"" Over-intelligent people spend more time being clever than being effective. Over-researching relatively minor things. Take a quick look, get an understanding, choose one. Change later if it becomes an issue. Trying to reinvent the wheel constantly. Positive sum games don't require natural talent. By building more, accomplishing more, facilitating more in a way that makes it possible for others to build more, accomplish more, and facilitate more, then you never run out of spots. Cross-reference two important disciplines that haven't talked to each other enough yet, BAM. LUCK DOESN'T EXIST Life is a series of probabilities. Every day, there's a chance that a given set of things will happen. Expose yourself to high-upside probability. How about people who are born into a good situation vs. a bad one? Were they ""lucky""? No, of course not. They've got their background, training, country they live in, city they live in, whatever, as a result of the conscious decisions of the people that came before them. Dad decided he wanted to work really hard, save his money, raise his kids well, and build the next generation instead of just consuming for himself. Hustle, yes. Hard work, yes. Discipline, yes. Strong family ties, yes. Luck? No. Well, how about when someone dies senselessly, in a car crash or some such? Well, that's the closest you can get to something that's ""bad luck"", but even then, were you as careful about safety as you could be? You go to a Third World country, your chance of dying this year goes up quite a lot. You're not one in a multitude unless you want to be. You can never ascribe someone else as part of a multitude without their consent. To work with talented and driven people, you gotta show you belong in that crowd, which means self-starting. Once you do start doing lots of interesting and engaging things, then it becomes a lot easier to meet and connect with people. Build universally valuable skills: Things you can start doing, no matter what you are passionate about. Skills that are going to be useful when you do discover what juices you up. * Starting to study and develop your own ethical system * Making good friends, advisors, and mentors who are strong and decent people * Learning universally useful skills * Earning a few credentials * Putting money in the bank * Getting your credit up * Studying history to learn what's possible * Establishing good habits that'll carry you through life * Becoming very fit and healthy * Learning how to think The difference between a generalist and a dabbler is just shipping the work. The dabbler moves on when things get tough. The generalist keeps going until he puts enough work out that he feels complete in a particular field. How you discover passions: Take a crack at it once and see if you like it at all. Then start studying and improving your craft, and see if you like that too. Produce and ship things while you have a current interest. Even on fleeting interests, try to ship something or produce somehow. Why executives and big companies hire consultants: So someone less emotionally attached can tell them what to do. I would rather die than be average. I don't believe in equality. What sort of cowardice would you need to feel to wish for everyone to be the same? Isn't it obvious that 4 out of 5 don't even bother trying to improve the world and themselves? Something going wrong is an expensive lesson I already paid for - might as well take it. Nobody gives you what you're ""worth"" in the abstract. They give you what you force them to give you. Thinking strategically: Very few people do this. This is saying, ""What am I trying to accomplish?"" instead of ""What should I do?"" The hierarchy is something like: Not thinking < Tactics < Strategy < Philosophy Philosophical people get treated the best and paid the best and live the best lives. * The non-thinking designer says, ""Yes, I'll color on the page for you for $50."" * The tactical designer says, ""I'll find a good way to color the page for you."" * The strategic designer says, ""I'm going to understand your fundamental goals for this piece, and make this piece work hard for your goals."" (Note: Being strategic is enough to get paid a lot and live well.) * The philosophical designer says, ""The nature of art is art, and the nature of commerce is commerce. I can make a beautiful and amazing piece of art that will serve all of your strategic and commercial goals, and will also be a timeless aesthetic. I am an eternal devotee of this craft, and I can fuse art and commerce into extreme practical beauty, for you, if you are enlightened enough to work with."" Study how Paul Rand worked. Today, I turn my attention to the fundamentals. I will exert my will over my body. I will communicate my spirit and intentions through my actions.","Essays on history, power, self-discipline, negotiation, and the hustle. I especially liked his philosophy on luck, building universally valuable skills, and producing/shipping something from even fleeting interests."
Wired for Story,Lisa Cron,1607742454,6,"Writers are, and have always been, among the most powerful people in the world. Art is fire plus algebra. We have an innate belief that we know what makes a good story - after all, we can quickly recognize a bad one. The first job of any good story is to completely anesthetize the part of our brain that questions how it is creating such a compelling illusion of reality. You have to be as honest about your story as you would a movie you begin watching with one finger still poised on the remote. Pinpoint where each trouble spot lies and then remedy it before it spreads like a weed. Stories allow us to simulate intense experiences without actually having to live through them. A way to explore our own mind and the minds of others, as a sort of dress rehearsal for the future. Story helps us survive not only in the life-and-death physical sense but also in a life-well-lived social sense. What’s the worst that could happen if I had an affair to spice up my boring life as the wife of a country doctor? How can I avoid a suicidal confrontation with raiders who want my land today without looking like a coward and thereby ceding it to them tomorrow? The answers are to be found in any bookstore or any video store. Our expectations have everything to do with the story’s ability to provide information on how we might safely navigate this earthly plane. What a story is supposed to do: plunk someone with a clear goal into an increasingly difficult situation they then have to navigate. When a story meets our brain’s criteria, we relax and slip into the protagonist’s skin, eager to experience what his or her struggle feels like. A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result. Create what appears to the reader as reality, only sharper, clearer, and far more entertaining, because stories do what our cognitive unconscious does: filter out everything that would distract us from the situation. What does your protagonist have to confront in order to solve the problem you’ve so cleverly set up for her? That problem is what the reader is going to be hunting for from the get-go, because it’s going to define everything that happens from the first sentence on. Nothing focuses the mind like surprise. “How he or she changes” is what the story itself is actually about. We’re jonesing for the feeling that something out of the ordinary is happening. We crave the notion that we’ve come in at a crucial juncture in someone’s life, and not a moment too soon. What intoxicates us is the hint that not only is trouble brewing, but it’s longstanding and about to reach critical mass. This means that from the first sentence we need to catch sight of the breadcrumb trail that will lure us deeper into the thicket. What we’re hoping for in that opening sentence is the sense that something is about to change. There has to be a ball already in play. The three basic things readers relentlessly hunt for as they read that first page: 1. Whose story is it? 2. What’s happening here? 3. What’s at stake? We need to meet the protagonist as soon as possible - hopefully, in the first paragraph. Choose a book based solely on its first sentence. “Joel Campbell, eleven years old at the time, began his descent into murder with a bus ride.” All three questions were answered in a single sentence. 1. Whose story is it? Joel Campbell’s. 2. What’s happening here? He’s on a bus, which has somehow triggered what will result in murder. (Talk about “all is not as it seems”!) 3. What is at stake? Joel’s life, someone else’s life, and who knows what else. What hooks us, and keeps us reading, is the dopamine-fueled desire to know what happens next. Without that, nothing else matters. Zero in on the point your story is making. A story is designed, from beginning to end, to answer a single overarching question. A few telltale signs that a story is going off the rails: We know who the protagonist is, but she doesn’t seem to have a goal, We know what the protagonist’s goal is, but have no clue what inner issue it forces him to deal with, What happens doesn’t seem to affect him or whether he achieves it. FOCUS: The story isn’t about whether or not the protagonist achieves her goal per se; it’s about what she has to overcome internally to do it. The theme, is what your story says about human nature. Theme tends to be reflected in how your characters treat each other. The plot itself - the events that relentlessly force the protagonist to deal with her issue. Theme actually boils down to something incredibly simple: • What does the story tell us about what it means to be human? • What does it say about how humans react to circumstances beyond their control? Ask yourself, What is it I want my readers to walk away thinking about? What point does my story make? How do I want to change the way my reader sees the world? MYTH: The Plot Is What the Story Is About REALITY: A Story Is About How the Plot Affects the Protagonist Only when embodied in the very specific does a universal become accessible. In the abstract, universals are so vast they’re impossible to wrap your mind around. It’s only when expressed through the flesh-and-blood reality of a story, that we’re able to experience a universal one-on-one, and feel it. “Show, don’t tell.” It’s the story’s job to show us the theme, not the theme’s job to tell us the story. Define what, exactly, your story is about before you begin writing. The most important, yet often overlooked, element of story - letting the reader know how your protagonist is reacting internally. You may be in only one head per scene. Common mistake writers make is using body language to tell us something we already know. Body language should tell us something we don’t know. At its most effective, it tells us what’s really going on inside the character’s head. Make us feel. Tell us what to feel, on the other hand, and what we’ll feel is bullied. The less you tell us how to feel, the more likely we’ll feel exactly what you want us to. When we read a story, we really do slip into the protagonist’s skin, feeling what she feels, experiencing what she experiences. And what we feel is based, 100 percent, on one thing: her goal, which then defines how she evaluates everything the other characters do. We succeed only as we identify a single overriding objective, and make all other considerations bend to that one objective. Readers assume that everything the writer tells them is there on a strictly need-to-know basis. Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. The brain is built to think socially. Adding external problems adds drama only if they’re something the protagonist must confront to overcome her issue. Make sure that everything your protagonist faces - beginning on page one - springs specifically from the problem she needs to solve, both internally and externally. The moment one of those erroneous implicit beliefs is formed - everyone’s only in it for themselves, so the nicer someone is, the more you know they’re out to con you - we blithely misinterpret everything that happens to us. We don’t even know we’re doing it until something happens that proves us wrong. Stories often begin at just that moment, as one of the protagonist’s long-held beliefs is about to be called into question. Writing a story, where is the best place to start? Pinpoint the moment long before, when she first fell prey to the inner issue that’s been skewing her worldview ever since. Story is about something that is changing. The exhilarating time when things are in flux, giving the reader the illusion that it really could go either way. We tend to find abstract concepts thumpingly boring. Thus the whole point of a story is to translate the general into a specific, so we can see what it really means, just in case we ever come face to face with it in a dark alley. We also think in metaphor. Metaphor is how the mind “couches the abstract concepts in concrete terms.” Believe it or not, we utter about six metaphors a minute. Prices soared. My heart sank. Time ran out. Metaphor is so ubiquitous we rarely notice it. Metaphors have resonance only when we know, specifically, what they’re supposed to illuminate. Otherwise, although it definitely sounds like it’s meant to tell us something really important, we’re left thinking, I know this has great significance, but I have no idea of what. Nor should we have to spend even a nanosecond decoding a metaphor. It should be “gettable” when reading at a clip, and its meaning instantly grasped. What’s more, metaphors need to give us new information and fresh insight rather than simply restating something we already know. Unless they convey necessary information, sensory details clog a story’s arteries. Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip. You can’t hum the scenery. Every story has more than one versus, here are the most common: • What the protagonist believes is true versus what is actually true • What the protagonist wants versus what the protagonist actually has • What the protagonist wants versus what’s expected of her • The protagonist versus herself • The protagonist’s inner goal versus the protagonist’s external goal • The protagonist’s fear versus the protagonist’s goal (external, internal, or both) • The protagonist versus the antagonist • The antagonist versus mercy (or the appearance thereof) A major reveal is the surprise near the end that twists the meaning of everything that came before it. It’s Darth Vader booming, “I am your father, Luke”. Reveals are shocking, yet they are completely believable the second we hear them. Why? Because up to that moment, although the story made sense, we couldn’t quite shake the feeling that there was more going on. The writers gave us a specific pattern of hints all the way along. And so, although each story made sense up to that moment, in light of the reveal it makes even more sense. Make sure that the story gains something by withholding specific facts for a big reveal later. Follow a cause-and-effect trajectory beginning on page one, so that each scene is triggered by the one that preceded it. Answer the “And so?” to everything in the story. Ask this question relentlessly, like a four-year-old, and the minute you can’t answer, know that you’re likely in the company of a darling, a digression, or something else likely to cause your story to go into free fall. Craft a plot that forces her to confront head-on just about everything she’s spent her entire life avoiding. The harder she tries, the harder it gets. Ensure that everything the protagonist does to remedy the situation only makes it worse. Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large misfortunes. Expose your characters’ flaws, demons, and insecurities. Jung: “One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.” The most basic way to get someone’s attention is this: Break a pattern.","If you've read other books on how to write a great story, this probably won't hold much new for you. But this was my first book on this subject, and I loved it. Changed the way I pay attention to movies and novels. Makes me want to write a novel."
Pragmatic Programmer,Andy Hunt and David Thomas,020161622X,6,"Don't leave ""broken windows"" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets. Unfortunately, they're expiring assets. Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and environments are developed. Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio: Serious investors invest regularly-as a habit. Diversification is the key to long-term success. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. Buy low, sell high. Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding. Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. If you've used only makefiles and an editor, try an IDE, and vice versa. The DRY principle: Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system. Duplication we see falls into one of the following categories: Imposed duplication. Developers feel they have no choice-the environment seems to require duplication. Inadvertent duplication. Developers don't realize that they are duplicating information. Impatient duplication. Developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier. Interdeveloper duplication. Multiple people on a team (or on different teams) duplicate a piece of information. Sometimes, duplication seems to be forced on us. With a bit of ingenuity you can normally remove the need for duplication. Often the answer is to write a simple filter or code generator. Structures in multiple languages can be built from a common metadata representation using a simple code generator The trick is to make the process active: this cannot be a one-time conversion, or we're back in a position of duplicating data. Keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, and reserve the comments for other, high-level explanations. It is easier to write relatively small, self-contained components than a single large block of code. If components have specific, well-defined responsibilities, they can be combined with new components in ways that were not envisioned by their original implementors. If I dramatically change the requirements behind a particular function, how many modules are affected? If you need to change an object's state, get the object to do it for you. Avoid global data. Explicitly pass any required context into your modules. Every module can have its own unit test built into its code, and these tests can be performed automatically as part of the regular build process. Nothing is more dangerous than an idea if it's the only one you have. Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system. What sorts of things might you choose to investigate with a prototype? Anything that carries risk. Anything that hasn't been tried before, or that is absolutely critical to the final system. Anything unproven, experimental, or doubtful. Anything you aren't comfortable with. Its value lies not in the code produced, but in the lessons learned. Program Close to the Problem domain: By coding at a higher level of abstraction, you are free to concentrate on solving domain problems, and can ignore petty implementation details. While the code for parsing a ""real"" language may be harder to write, it will be much easier for people to understand, and to extend in the future with new features. The units you use make a difference in the interpretation of the result. If you say that something will take about 130 working days, then people will be expecting it to come in pretty close. However, if you say ""Oh, about six months,"" then they know to look for it any time between five and seven months Human-readable forms of data, and self-describing data, will outlive all other forms of data and the applications that created them. In explaining the problem to another person you must explicitly state things that you may take for granted when going through the code yourself. By having to verbalize some of these assumptions, you may suddenly gain new insight into the problem. Write Code That Writes Code: There are two main types of code generators: Passive code generators are run once to produce a result. From that point forward, the result becomes freestanding-it is divorced from the code generator. Active code generators are used each time their results are required. The result is a throw-away-it can always be reproduced by the code generator. Often, active code generators read some form of script or control file to produce their results. It is simpler to express it in a simpler, language-neutral representation and generate the code for both languages, The concept of Design by Contract: What is a correct program? One that does no more and no less than it claims to do. Documenting and verifying that claim is the heart of Design by Contract Be strict in what you will accept before you begin, and promise as little as possible in return. Remember, if your contract indicates that you'll accept anything and promise the world in return, then you've got a lot of code to write! Organize your code into cells (modules) and limit the interaction between them. Using The Law of Demeter will make your code more adaptable and robust. No amount of genius can overcome a preoccupation with detail. ""Out with the details!"" Get them out of the code. While we're at it, we can make our code highly configurable and ""soft""-that is, easily adaptable to changes. Think declaratively (specifying what is to be done, not how) and create highly dynamic and adaptable programs. We do this by adopting a general rule: program for the general case, and put the specifics somewhere else-outside the compiled code base. Because business policy and rules are more likely to change than any other aspect of the project, it makes sense to maintain them in a very flexible format. A way to get quick and dirty load balancing among multiple consumer processes: the hungry consumer model. In a hungry consumer model, you replace the central scheduler with a number of independent consumer tasks and a centralized work queue. Each consumer task grabs a piece from the work queue and goes on about the business of processing it. As each task finishes its work, it goes back to the queue for some more. This way, if any particular task gets bogged down, the others can pick up the slack, and each individual component can proceed at its own pace. Each component is temporally decoupled from the others. Tip 40 Design Using Services Instead of components, we have really created services-independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces. Program deliberately: Don't code blindfolded. Attempting to build an application you don't fully understand, or to use a technology you aren't familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences. Proceed from a plan. Document your assumptions. Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions Rather than construction, software is more like gardening-it is more organic than concrete. When Should You Refactor? When you come across a stumbling block because the code doesn't quite fit anymore, or you notice two things that should really be merged, or anything else at all strikes you as being ""wrong,"" don't hesitate to change it Don't try to refactor and add functionality at the same time. Don't Use Manual Procedures: People just aren't as repeatable as computers are. Nor should we expect them to be. A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time. Suppose you wanted to automate code review scheduling and approval. You might put a special marker in each source code file: /* Status: needs_review */ A simple script could go through all of the source code and look for all files that had a status of needs_review, indicating that they were ready to be reviewed. You could then post a list of those files as a Web page, automatically send e-mail to the appropriate people, Most developers hate testing. They tend to test gently, subconsciously knowing where the code will break and avoiding the weak spots. Pragmatic Programmers are different. We are driven to find our bugs now, so we don't have to endure the shame of others finding our bugs later. A good project may well have more test code than production code. Types of software testing that you need to perform: Unit testing Integration testing Validation and verification Resource exhaustion, errors, and recovery Performance testing Usability testing Integration testing shows that the major subsystems that make up the project work and play well with each other. When the system does fail, will it fail gracefully? You need data to stress the boundary conditions. This data may be completely synthetic: date fields containing February 29, 1999, huge record sizes, or addresses with foreign postal codes. Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. The automated tests should be modified to check for that particular bug from then on, every time, with no exceptions, no matter how trivial, Downplay the dichotomy between code and documentation, and instead treat them as two views of the same model (see It's Just a View). Apply all of our pragmatic principles to documentation as well as to code. Commenting source code gives you the perfect opportunity to document those elusive bits of a project that can't be documented anywhere else: engineering trade-offs, why decisions were made, what other alternatives were discarded, and so on. A simple module-level header comment, comments for significant data and type declarations, and a brief per-class and per-method header, describing how the function is used and anything that it does that is not obvious. Remember that you (and others after you) will be reading the code many hundreds of times, but only writing it a few times. Take the time to spell out connectionPool instead of cp. Suppose we have a specification that lists the columns in a database table. We'll then have a separate set of SQL commands to create the actual table in the database, and probably some kind of programming language record structure to hold the contents of a row in the table. The same information is repeated three times. Change any one of these three sources, and the other two are immediately out of date. This is a clear violation of the DRY principle. To correct this problem, we need to choose the authoritative source of information. This may be the specification, it may be a database schema tool, or it may be some third source altogether. Let's choose the specification document as the source. It's now our model for this process. We then need to find a way to export the information it contains as different views-a database schema and a high-level language record, for example. Times you need to present the same documentation in different formats: a printed document, Web pages, online help, or perhaps a slide show. The typical solution relies heavily on cut-and-paste, creating a number of new independent documents from the original. This is a bad idea: a document's presentation should be independent of its content. If you are using a markup system, you have the flexibility to implement as many different output formats as you need. You can choose to have <H1>Chapter Title</H1> generate a new chapter in the report version of the document and title a new slide in the slide show. Technologies such as XSL and CSS can be used to generate multiple output formats from this one markup. As long as your original markup is rich enough to express all the concepts you need (including hyperlinks), translation to any other publishable form can be both easy and automatic. You can produce online help, published manuals, product highlights for the Web site, and even a tip-a-day calendar, all from the same source-which of course is under source control and is built along with the nightly build. The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users. A project that falls below their expectations is deemed a failure, no matter how good the deliverable is in absolute terms. Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations Some consultants call this process ""managing expectations""-actively controlling what users should hope to get from their systems. We think this is a somewhat elitist position. Our role is not to control the hopes of our users. Instead, we need to work with them to come to a common understanding of the development process and the final deliverable, along with those expectations they have not yet verbalized. If you work closely with your users, sharing their expectations and communicating what you're doing, then there will be few surprises when the project gets delivered. This is a BAD THING. Try to surprise your users. Not scare them, mind you, but delight them. Give them that little bit more than they were expecting. The extra bit of effort it requires to add some user-oriented feature to the system will pay for itself time and time again in goodwill. Listen to your users as the project progresses for clues about what features would really delight them.","Classic book for computer programmers. I read it first in 2003 before I was taking book notes, so I read it again now to take notes. Great wisdom in here. Amazing to see how much of its advice was adopted as norms by Ruby on Rails."
Meditations - by Marcus Aurelius,nslation by C Scot Hicks and David V Hicks,0743233832,6,"INTRODUCTION: (by translators, not Aurelius) We need to be reminded more often than informed. Work intelligently with what is given - not wasting time fantasizing about flawless people and perfect choices. Marcus never did anything, not even the smallest thing, as if he considered it unimportant. He took a detailed interest in all matters. Marcus regarded obstacles as opportunities for the exercise of reason. Guard the mind from false opinions and harmful desires. If we fail to exercise self-censorship and judgement, then we are the ad-man's dream, and our lives our not our own. Good life begins in the mind, but one cannot realize the good life cut off from a good society. BOOK TWO: Remember how long you have procrastinated, and how consistently you have failed to put to good use your suspended sentence. Your days are numbered. Use them to throw open the windows of your soul to the sun. Take the time to concentrate your mind in the acquisition of some new and useful knowledge - and stop it from flittering about. Nothing is more pathetic than feverishly circling the earth and ""probing into its depths"", to guess what other people are thinking, while all the time failing to realize that one only needs to attend to the inner spirit, and to serve it with unswerving devotion. Even the slightest act should have some end in mind. BOOK THREE: Purge your mind of aimless and idle thoughts. Show the world a simple and kindly man, a good neighbor, indifferent to sensual pleasures and luxuries, untouched by jealousy, envy, and mistrust. Neither popularity, nor wealth, nor power, nor the pleasures of the flesh should compete in your affection for the good that flows from reason and neighborliness. If it's to the advantage of your reasonable self, seize hold of it. If it's merely to the advantage of your animal self, admit it and don't pretend it's more than that. Take no detours from the high road of reason and social responsibility. Nothing produces greatness of mind like the habit of examining methodically and honestly everything we enounter in this life, and of determining its place in the order of things, its intended use, its value to the whole universe, and its worth to man in his role as citizen. Pursue the matter at hand along the straight path of reason, advancing with intensity, vigor, and grace, and without being distracted along the way. Just as surgeons keep their scalpels handy, keep your principles with you at all times, ready to delve into anything. Stop jumping off the track. (You don't have time to do uncrucial things you've collected for your old age.) Throw off vain hope and sprint to the finish. Come to your own aid while there's still time. BOOK FOUR: Never act without purpose and resolve, or without the means to finish the job. Nowhere is there a vacation home more private and peaceful than in one's own mind. Take this vacation and charge your spirit, but not beyond what is necessary to send you back to your work free of anxiety and full of vigor and good cheer. Nothing outside the mind can disturb it. Trouble comes from the mind's opinion of what lies outside it. Once reason goes to work for you, what more can you need? To be happy, limit your activities to a few. Do what is necessary and no more. Remove not only unnecessary actions, but also the superfluous ideas that inspire needless acts. The man who fails to understand what goes on in the world is a fugitive running from the law. Change is never bad nor good. Judgement about change is not helpful. How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened. Bad luck borne nobly is good luck. BOOK FIVE: Were you born for enjoyment? Look at the plants, ants, spiders and bees, all busy at their work, welding the world. Why should you hesitate to do your part? If it is good to say or do something, then it is even better to be criticized for having said or done it. Be like a vine that bears its fruit and asks for nothing more than the pleasure of producing grapes. A dog hunts, a bee makes honey, and one man helps another. What does not hurt the community cannot hurt the individual. Every time you think you've been wronged, apply this rule: If the community isn't hurt by it, then neither am I. But what if the community is hurt? Then don't be angry with the person who caused the injury. Just help him to see his mistake. BOOK SIX: Factual descriptions allow you to see things for what they are. Whenever something makes ambitious claims for itself, lay those claims bare by stripping away all the fancy dress and exposing the naked facts. When you flatter yourself that you are engaged in some worthy enterprise, then you are most easily deceived. Prove to me that I am mistaken, and I will gladly change. Harm comes from persisting in error and clinging to ignorance. Think of the virtues and talents of those around you. The sight of these splendid qualities in our friends - keep them always in mind. The happiness of those who want to be popular depends on others. The happiness of those who seek pleasure fluctuates with moods outside their control. But the happiness of the wise grows out of their own free acts. You always own the option of having no opinion. Things you can't control are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone. Learn to concentrate on what those around you are saying. Enter as deeply as possible into the mind of each speaker. BOOK SEVEN: The measure of a man is the worth of the things he cares about. Those who are affected by outward circumstance will always find something to complain about. Every moment provides us with opportunities to exercise the virtues of neighborliness and thought. Nothing is new or unmanageable. Everything is familiar and serviceable. To live each day as if it were your last - without speeding up or slowing down or pretending to be other than what you are - this is perfection of character. How ridiculous not to avoid wronging others, which I have the power to do, while wishing to avoid being wronged by others whose actions are beyond my control. When you have done something well and someone else has benefited from it, why do you crave yet a third reward - to be thanked or to be repaid? BOOK EIGHT: Refuse to approve ideas that are false or foggy. Direct your energies only to the common good. Don't go looking for equality in individual cases. Make your comparisons by examining large samples and total outcomes. No one should ever hear you complaining about palace life. No one - not even your own ears. No man feels any regret for failing to indulge in a pleasure. Pleasure, therefore, is neither useful nor good. Be happy if each act you perform contributes to a fulfulling and complete life. No one can prevent you from doing this. What if some outside circumstance stands in my way? Not even that can stop you from acting justly, wisely, and reasonably. By welcoming the obstacle and by calmly adapting your action to it, you will be able to do something else in harmony with your goals. If you're troubled by something outside yourself, it isn't the thing itself that bothers you, but your opinion of it. You have the power to immediately revoke this opinion. Men exist for the sake of one another. Teach them to be better or put up with them. BOOK NINE: Deceit, hypocrisy, luxury, and pride: flee this plague. The corruption of your mind and soul is a plague far more deadly than any pollution. You're more likely to find a clod of dirt detached from the earth than a man entirely cut off from mankind. Whether in sickness or in any other circumstance, let no difficulty or hardship cause you to abandon philosophy or to tune it to the gossip of the foolish and uneducated. When somebody's behavior offends you, find fault instead with yourself for failing to anticipate his offensive behavior. Your ability to reason should have told you that he would misbehave. Having done a good deed, what more do you want? To be paid? Do the eyes demand payment for seeing, or the feet fees for walking? BOOK TEN: The high-minded place reason above fame, death, and the like. Stop all this theorizing about what a good man should be. Be it! Either you go on living here at the center of things, or you withdraw from active life and move away, or you die and your work is done. There is no other choice but these. What is the very best you can say or do with the material you have to work with? Whatever that is, you can say or do it. Make no excuse by claiming that something prevents you. BOOK ELEVEN: The rational mind looks at and delves into itself, molds itself to its own liking, and enjoys the fruit it bears. (Unlike the fruits of plants, which are harvested by others.) The rational mind is honest and modest at the same time as prizing itself above everything else. Have I acted unselfishly? Then I have benefited. Hold fast to this thought, and keep up the good work. No situation is better suited for the practice of philosophy than the one you're in now. A man cuts himself off from others, not realizing that he is cutting himself off from the whole of civilized society. Frequent separation makes it increasingly difficult for the severed part to rejoin the whole and regain its original vigor. The branch that is grafted on after being broken off belongs to the tree but doesn't share its thoughts. Stand guard in both respects: be tough-minded in thought and action while being gentle to those who oppose or annoy you. It is as much a weakness to become harsh as it is to shrink from action and relent out of fear. Both abandon their posts: the one who panics, the other who is estranged from a natural brother and friend. The soul remains a perfect sphere when it neither pushes out after something nor shrinks back into itself. How false and beneath contempt is the man who says, ""Let me be perfectly frank with you."" What is he up to? There is no need to dress up the truth. It will be evident in your words, written on your face, ringing in your voice, flashing from your eyes. To live an exemplary life, remain indifferent to the things that are themselves indifferent. Nothing can oblige us to form an opinion of it. Things don't force themselves upon us. No one can be blamed for seeking his own good. Ask of everything: Where did it come from? Of what is it made? Into what is it changing? What will it be after it has changed? It isn't what others do that troubles you. You are bothered by your opinions of what they do. Rid yourself of those opinions, and your troubles will go away. Remind yourself that you aren't disgraced by what others do. Shun temptations of the mind by saying to yourself: - This is an idle speculation - This isn't what I really think - This will lower my estimation of myself Except in the case of those things they hold in common, most people cannot agree on a definition of what is good. For this reason, it makes sense to aim at the common good, the well-being of society as a whole. He who strives to achieve this aim in life will be consistent in his behavior and therefore one and the same person throughout his life. You can't master the arts of reading and writing until you've studied them. This applies even more to those who would master the art of living. BOOK TWELVE: I marvel at how men love themselves more than others, while at the same time caring more about what others think of them than what they think of themselves. Be a boxer, not a gladiator, in the way you act on your principles. The gladiator takes up his sword, only to put it down again. But the boxer is never without his fist and has only to clench it. Only a fool or stranger on this planet will be surprised by anything in his life. If it's not right, don't do it. If it's not true, don't say it. Whatever causes you to be upset has always happened and will always happen, and even now is happening everywhere.","A true classic, filled with stoic wisdom mostly about being your best rational self, doing good for its own sake, and not letting other people upset you."

TRUTH: Other people’s behavior is more the result of the situation than their disposition. == You have no clue why you act the way you do, choose the things you choose, or think the thoughts you think. Instead, you create narratives, little stories to explain away why. You are filled with beliefs that look good on paper but fall apart in practice. When those beliefs fall apart, you tend not to notice. You have a deep desire to be right all of the time and a deeper desire to see yourself in a positive light both morally and behaviorally. You can stretch your mind pretty far to achieve these goals. Cognitive biases are predicable patterns of thought and behavior that lead you to draw incorrect conclusions. Many of them serve to keep you confident in your own perceptions or to inhibit you from seeing yourself as a buffoon. Heuristics are mental shortcuts you use to solve common problems. They speed up processing in the brain, but sometimes when you think so fast you miss what is important. When a stimulus in the past affects the way you behave and think or the way you perceive another stimulus later on, it is called priming. (In an office environment:) Mere exposure to briefcases and fancy pens had altered the behavior of normal, rational people. They became more competitive, greedier, and had no idea why. Faced with having to explain themselves, they rationalized their behavior with erroneous tales they believed were true. Just about every physical object you encounter triggers a blitz of associations throughout your mind. If a situation is familiar you can fall back on intuition. If a situation is novel, you will have to boot up your conscious mind. You can’t prime yourself directly, but you can create environments conducive to the mental states you wish to achieve. When you explain why you feel the way you do, or why you behaved as you did, take it with a grain of salt. You can become so confident in your worldview that no one can dissuade you. In science, you move closer to the truth by seeking evidence to the contrary. Perhaps the same method should inform your opinions as well. When you learn something new, you quickly redact your past so you can feel the comfort of always being right. You are always looking back at the person you used to be, always reconstructing the story of your life to better match the person you are today. Like a cowboy shooting at a barn: Over time, the side of the barn becomes riddled with holes. In some places there are lots of them, in others there are few. If the cowboy later paints a bull’s-eye over a spot where his bullet holes clustered together, it looks like he is pretty good with a gun. By painting a bull’s-eye over a cluster of bullet holes, the cowboy places artificial order over natural random chance. Now-you must trick future-you into doing what is right for both. In any perilous event, like a sinking ship or a towering inferno, a shooting rampage or a tornado, there is a chance you will become so overwhelmed by the perilous overflow of ambiguous information that you will do nothing at all. 75% of people find it impossible to reason during a catastrophic event or impending doom. The sort of people who survive are the sort of people who prepare for the worst and practice ahead of time. They’ve done the research, or built the shelter, or run the drills. They look for the exits and imagine what they will do. These people don’t deliberate during calamity because they’ve already done the deliberation. Normalcy bias is a state of mind out of which you are attempting to make everything OK by believing it still is. Normalcy bias is refusing to believe terrible events will include you. You are more likely to dawdle if you fail to understand the seriousness of the situation and have never been exposed to advice about what to do. Normalcy bias can be scaled up to larger events as well. Global climate change, peak oil, obesity epidemics, and stock market crashes are good examples of larger, more complex events in which people fail to act because it is difficult to imagine just how abnormal life could become if the predictions are true. When you are faced with a decision in which you are forced to think about your rationale, you start to turn the volume in your emotional brain down and the volume in your logical brain up. You start creating a mental list of pros and cons that would never have been conjured up if you had gone with your gut. The act of introspection can sometimes lead you to make decisions that look good on virtual paper but leave you emotionally lacking. Research into introspection calls into question the entire industry of critical analysis of art - video games, music, film, poetry, literature - all of it. When you ask people why they do or do not like things, they must then translate something from a deep, emotional, primal part of their psyche into the language of the higher, logical, rational world of words. Introspection is not the act of tapping into your innermost mental constructs but is instead a fabrication. You look at what you did, or how you felt, and you make up some sort of explanation that you can reasonably believe. If you have to tell others, you make up an explanation they can believe too. It’s simply easier to believe something if you are presented with examples than it is to accept something presented in numbers or abstract facts. You use the availability heuristic first and the facts second. You decide the likelihood of a future event on how easily you can imagine it, and if you’ve been bombarded by reports or have filled your head with fears, those images will overshadow new information that might contradict your beliefs. Pluralistic ignorance - a situation where everyone is thinking the same thing but believes he or she is the only person who thinks it. It takes only one person to help for others to join in. People rush to help once they see another person leading by example. You should always be the first person to break away from the pack and offer help - or attempt escape - because you can be certain no one else will. The less you know about a subject, the less you believe there is to know in total. Amateurs are far more likely to think they are experts than actual experts are. Apophenia is refusing to believe in clutter and noise, in coincidence and chance. When you connect the dots in your life in a way that tells a story, and then you interpret the story to have a special meaning, this is true apophenia. If the product is unnecessary, like an iPad, there is a great chance the customer will become a fanboy because he had to choose to spend a big chunk of money on it. It’s the choosing of one thing over another that leads to narratives about why you did it, which usually tie in to your self-image. Branding builds on this by giving you the option to create the person you think you are through choosing to align yourself with the mystique of certain products. Next time you get ready to launch into one hundred reasons why your cell phone or TV or car is better than someone else’s, hesitate. Because you’re not trying to change the other person’s mind - you’re trying to prop up your own. The straw man fallacy follows a familiar pattern. You first build the straw man, then you attack it, then you point out how easy it was to defeat it, and then you come to a conclusion. In creating a fantasy scenario where the world goes mad if the other person’s argument were to win, you have constructed a straw man. Sometimes people morph the straw man into a warning about a slippery slope where allowing one side to win would put humanity on a course of destruction. Any time someone begins an attack with “So you’re saying we should all just...” or “Everyone knows... ,” you can bet a straw man is coming. When you assume someone is incorrect based on who that person is or what group he or she belongs to, you have committed the ad hominem fallacy. The ad hominem fallacy can also work in reverse. You might assume someone is trustworthy because they speak well, or have a respectable job. You might be a great judge of character, but you need to be a great judge of evidence to avoid delusion. You tend to blame the victim, not because you are a terrible person but because you want to believe you are smart enough to avoid the same fate. You want the world to be fair, so you pretend it is. Remember the unfair nature of the world, the randomness of birthright, means people often suffer adversity and enjoy opulence through no effort of their own. If you think the world is just and fair, people who need help may never get it. You are far more vulnerable to suggestion when the subject of the conversation is you. You have an idealistic vision of yourself, a character you’ve dreamed up in your mind, and you are always trying to become this character. You seek out groups to affiliate with to better solidify who you are in the story you tell yourself - the story explaining why you do the things you do. For any plan to work, every team needs at least one asshole who doesn’t give a shit if he or she gets fired or exiled or excommunicated. For a group to make good decisions, they must allow dissent and convince everyone they are free to speak their mind without risk of punishment. True groupthink depends on three conditions - a group of people who like one another, isolation, and a deadline for a crucial decision. As a primate, you are quick to form groups and then feel as if you should defend those groups from the ill wishes of other groups. When groups get together to make a decision, an illusion of invulnerability can emerge in which everyone feels secure in the cohesion. You begin to rationalize other people’s ideas and don’t reconsider your own. You want to defend the group’s cohesion from all harm, so you suppress doubts, you don’t argue, you don’t offer alternatives. Since everyone is doing this, the leader of the group falsely assumes everyone is in agreement. Research says the situation can be avoided if the boss is not allowed to express his or her expectations, thus preventing the boss’s opinion from automatically becoming the opinion of others. In addition, if the group breaks into pairs every once in a while to discuss the issue at hand, a manageable level of dissent can be fostered. Even better, allow outsiders to offer their opinions periodically during the process, to keep people’s objectivity afloat. Finally, assign one person the role of asshole and charge that person with the responsibility of finding fault in the plan. Before you come to a consensus, allow a cooling off period so emotions can return to normal. Decisions about risk and reward begin with the unconscious you. Unconscious-you notices things are either bad or good, dangerous or safe, before conscious-you can put those feelings into words. Logically, risks and benefits are two different things and must be judged separately, but you don’t judge things logically. The more something seems to benefit you, the less risky it seems overall. Trying to run counter to the culture is what creates the next wave of culture people will in turn attempt to counter. Self-esteem is mostly self-delusion, but it serves a purpose. You are biologically driven to think highly of yourself in order to avoid stagnation. If you were to stop and truly examine your faults and failures, you would become paralyzed by fear and doubt. To defeat feelings of inadequacy, you first have to imagine a task as being simple and easy. If you can manage to do that, illusory superiority takes over. CENSORSHIP: For every outlet of information, there are some who see it as dangerous not because it affects them, but because it might affect the thoughts and opinions of an imaginary third party. This sense of alarm about the impact of speech not on yourself but on others is called the third person effect. As a modern human, you are bombarded with media messages, but you see yourself as less affected than others. Somehow you have been inoculated against the persuaders, you think, so you have nothing to worry about. You can’t count on everyone else to be as strong as you are, so if you are like most people, there are some voices you think should be quiet. Third person effect is the source of outrage from religious leaders over “heretical propaganda” and the ire of political rulers over some speech out of a “fear of dissent.” You don’t want to believe you can be persuaded, and one way of maintaining this belief is to assume that all the persuasion flying through the air must be landing on other targets. When the third person effect leads you to condone censorship, take a step back and imagine the sort of messages people on the other side might think are brainwashing you, and then ask yourself if those messages should be censored too. When you vent, you stay angry and are more likely to keep doing aggressive things so you can keep venting. If you get accustomed to blowing off steam, you become dependent on it. The more effective approach is to just stop. The next time you see a line of people waiting to get into a classroom or a movie or a restaurant, feel free to break norms - go check the door and look inside. Just before you give up on a long-practiced routine, you freak out. It’s a final desperate attempt by the oldest parts of your brain to keep getting rewarded. Extinction bursts - a temporary increase in an old behavior, a plea from the recesses of your psyche. Set goals, and when you achieve them, shower yourself with garlands of your choosing. Don’t freak out when it turns out to be difficult. With complex tasks, it is usually easy to tell who isn’t pulling their weight. Once you know your laziness can be seen, you try harder. You do this because of another behavior called evaluation apprehension, which is just a fancy way of saying you care more when you know you are being singled out. Communal farms always produce less than individually owned farms. Choices, even small ones, can hold back the crushing weight of helplessness, but you can’t stop there. You must fight back your behavior and learn to fail with pride. Failing often is the only way to ever get the things you want out of life. Besides death, your destiny is not inescapable. Anticipatory rationalization: Self-handicapping behaviors are investments in a future reality in which you can blame your failure on something other than your ability. This behavior is all about keeping your all-important self-esteem strong and resilient. If you can always blame your failures on external forces, instead of internal ones, well, who’s to say you really fail? You are very resourceful when it comes to setting yourself up to fail. If you succeed, you can say you did so despite terrible odds. If you fall short, you can blame the events leading up to the failure instead of your own incompetence or inadequacy. When you see your performance in the outside world as an integral part of your personality, you are more likely to self-handicap. Psychologist Phillip Zombardo told The New York Times in 1984, “Some people stake their whole identity on their acts. They take the attitude that ‘if you criticize anything I do, you criticize me.’ Their egocentricity means they can’t risk a failure because it’s a devastating blow to their ego.” Whenever you venture into uncharted waters with failure as a distinct possibility, your anxiety will be lowered every time you see a new way to blame possible failure on forces beyond your control. SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY: You are always trying to predict the behavior of others. The future is the result of actions, and actions are the result of behavior, and behavior is the result of prediction. When people are trying to predict future events, they make a lot of assumptions about the present. If those assumptions are powerful enough, the resulting actions will lead to the predicted future. When you fear you will confirm a negative stereotype, it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy not because the stereotype is true, but because you can’t stop worrying that you could become an example proving it. When someone believes you are a certain kind of person, you tend to live up to those expectations. If you believe someone is going to be an asshole, you will act hostile, thus causing them to act like an asshole. If people think their partner doesn’t love them, they will interpret small slights as big hurts - and this will then lead to a feeling of rejection that causes the partner to distance him- or herself. If you want a better job, a better marriage, a better teacher, a better friend - you have to act as if the thing you want out of the other person is already headed your way. The person you imagine yourself to be is a story you tell to yourself and to others differently depending on the situation, and the story changes over time. For now, it is useful to imagine there are two selves active at any given time in your head - the current self and the remembering self. When you replay your life in your mind, you can’t go back to all the things you have ever experienced. Only the things that went from experience to short-term memory to long-term memory are available to fully remember. The self that makes decisions in your life is usually the remembering one. It drags your current self around in pursuit of new memories, anticipating them based on old memories. The current self has little control over your future. The current self is happy when experiencing things. It likes to be in the flow. The remembering self makes all the big decisions. It is happy when you can sit back and reflect on your life up to this point and feel content. It is happy when you tell people stories about the things you have seen and done. There are two channels through which you decide whether or not you are happy. The current self is happy when experiencing nice things. The remembering self is happy when you look back on your life and pull up plenty of positive memories. Happiness can’t be all one or all the other. You have to be happy in the flow of time while simultaneously creating memories you can look back on later. To be happy now and content later, you can’t be focused only on reaching goals, because once you reach them, the experience ends. To truly be happy, you must satisfy both of your selves. Go get the ice cream, but do so in a meaningful way that creates a long-term memory. Grind away to have money for later, but do so in a way that generates happiness as you work. If your life story includes self-improvement, and you find meaning in change, you suppress consistency bias. If you were to flip a coin and have it come up heads five times in a row, you would have a strong feeling deep in your gut the next toss would land on tails because it needed to. You think it must balance out. This is called the gambler’s fallacy, or the Monte Carlo fallacy after a casino roulette game there in 1913 where black came up 26 times in a row. In the minds of the gamblers the odds became astronomical that black would come up again; red just had to be next. Order must be restored. The excitement, the clamoring, and the noise as the ball bearing bounced across the numbers and colors was a great fit of delusion, because the odds never changed. It was just as likely to come up black, as it had 25 times before. This is how casinos always win; when you are winning, you find it difficult to walk away. The longer you play, however, the more the odds balance out. The subjects tended to see randomness as something they could outwit. This is why you are far more likely to participate in games of chance when there are some customizable features. Allowing you to choose your own lottery numbers or pick the numbers to bet on in roulette affects how you see the results. You assume the cold hand of fate becomes a tad less potent if you have some say in how you tempt it. Those with high socioeconomic status or who came from cultures where power and influence were highly regarded were more likely to think they were better at predicting the future. People even fear death less when they have a college degree. Those who are not grounded in reality, oddly enough, often achieve a lot in life simply because they believe they can and try harder than others. If you focus too long on your lack of power, you can slip into a state of learned helplessness that will whirl you into a negative feedback loop of depression. Some control is necessary or else you give up altogether. STEREOTYPE / JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS: When you don’t know much about a person, when you haven’t had a chance to get to know him or her, you have a tendency to turn the person into a character. You lean on archetypes and stereotypes culled from experience and fantasy. You tend to turn everyone into a character whose behavior is predictable. Instead of saying, “Jack is uncomfortable around people he doesn’t know, thus when I see him in public places he tends to avoid crowds,” you say, “Jack is shy.” It’s a shortcut, an easier way to navigate the social world. Your brain loves to take shortcuts. It is easy to ignore the power of the situation. Seeing people through the lens of their situation is one of the foundations of social psychology. When you see a behavior, like a child screaming in a supermarket while the seemingly oblivious parents continue to shop, you take a mental shortcut and conclude something about the story of their lives. Even though you know you don’t have enough information to understand, your conclusion still feels satisfying. When Americans were asked why they thought other U.S. citizens would want to defect to the former Soviet Union, 80 percent said the defectors were probably confused or traitorous. They imagined them as characters whose personalities predicted their actions. America, after all, is the land of the free and the home of the brave. When the researchers then asked why a Russian might defect to the States, 90 percent said the Russian was probably fleeing horrible living conditions or looking for a better way of life. From an American state of mind, the Russians weren’t motivated by their personalities, but by their environment. Instead of turning them into traitors, which would be deeply unsettling since they were coming to the subject’s home country, Americans had to place the blame for their behavior on something external. When you conjure an attribution for someone else’s actions, you consider consistency. You can’t check for consistency with your waitress or the people on the subway. You can’t tell if the person on the shooting rampage was being consistent, or if the person who just cut you off in traffic is always an asshole. When you can’t check for consistency, you blame people’s behavior on their personality. People are not good at heart, Zimbardo says, but because their environment encourages it. Anyone, he believes, is capable of becoming a monster if given the power and opportunity. When you look for a cause for another person’s actions, you find it. Rarely do you first consider how powerful the situation is. You blame the person, not the environment and the influence of the person’s peers. You do this because you would like to believe your own behavior comes strictly from within. You know this isn’t true though. You shift from introvert to extrovert, from brainiac to simpleton, from charismatic to impish - depending on where you find yourself and who is watching. The fundamental attribution error leads to labels and assumptions about who people are, but remember first impressions are mostly incorrect. Those impressions will linger until you get to know people and understand their situation and the circumstances in which their behavior is generated.","Great summary of 46 cognitive biases. Much of it covered in other books like Predictably Irrational, but if you haven't read those, this is a great starting book. Otherwise, just a good reminder, and worth reading."
The Lean Startup,Eric Ries,0307887898,6,"My definition of a startup: a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty. The stories in the magazines are lies: hard work and perseverance don’t lead to success. It’s the boring stuff that matters the most. Startup success is not a consequence of good genes or being in the right place at the right time. Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught. Early adopters: we often talked to them and asked for their feedback. But we emphatically did not do what they said. We viewed their input as only one source of information about our product and overall vision. In fact, we were much more likely to run experiments on our customers than we were to cater to their whims. An extremely fast cycle time, a focus on what customers want (without asking them), and a scientific approach to making decisions. Startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. All successful startup processes should be geared to accelerate that feedback loop. Focus on the boring stuff: how to measure progress, how to set up milestones, and how to prioritize work. This requires a new kind of accounting. Planning and forecasting are only accurate when based on a long, stable operating history and a relatively static environment. Startups have neither. Many entrepreneurs take a “just do it” attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success. Entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity. Progress in manufacturing is measured by the production of high-quality physical goods. As we’ll see in Chapter 3, the Lean Startup uses a different unit of progress, called validated learning. With scientific learning as our yardstick, we can discover and eliminate the sources of waste that are plaguing entrepreneurship. A method for measuring progress in the context of extreme uncertainty. Clear guidance on how to make the many trade-off decisions they face: whether and when to invest in process; formulating, planning, and creating infrastructure; when to go it alone and when to partner; when to respond to feedback and when to stick with vision; and how and when to invest in scaling the business. Most of all, it must allow entrepreneurs to make testable predictions. The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible. The Lean Startup is a new way of looking at the development of innovative new products that emphasizes fast iteration and customer insight. Too many startup business plans look more like they are planning to launch a rocket ship than drive a car. They prescribe the steps to take and the results to expect in excruciating detail, and as in planning to launch a rocket, they are set up in such a way that even tiny errors in assumptions can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The customers failed to materialize, the company had committed itself so completely that they could not adapt in time. They had “achieved failure” - successfully, faithfully, and rigorously executing a plan that turned out to have been utterly flawed. Instead of making complex plans that are based on a lot of assumptions, you can make constant adjustments with a steering wheel called the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Through this process of steering, we can learn when and if it’s time to make a sharp turn called a pivot or whether we should persevere along our current path. The strategy may have to change (called a pivot). However, the overarching vision rarely changes. Entrepreneurs are committed to seeing the startup through to that destination. Every setback is an opportunity for learning how to get where they want to go. Startups use many kinds of innovation: novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, devising a new business model that unlocks value that was hidden, or simply bringing a product or service to a new location or a previously underserved set of customers. Innovation is at the heart of the company’s success. Most tools from general management are not designed to flourish in the harsh soil of extreme uncertainty in which startups thrive. The future is unpredictable, customers face a growing array of alternatives, and the pace of change is ever increasing. Yet most startups - in garages and enterprises alike - still are managed by using standard forecasts, product milestones, and detailed business plans. Innovation is a bottoms-up, decentralized, and unpredictable thing, but that doesn’t mean it cannot be managed. It can, but to do so requires a new management discipline, one that needs to be mastered not just by practicing entrepreneurs seeking to build the next big thing but also by the people who support them, nurture them, and hold them accountable. In other words, cultivating entrepreneurship is the responsibility of senior management. Validated learning is the process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup’s present and future business prospects. It is more concrete, more accurate, and faster than market forecasting or classical business planning. Invite one of your friends to chat.” And she says, “No way!” We say, “Why not?” And she says, “Well, I don’t know if this thing is cool yet. You want me to risk inviting one of my friends? What are they going to think of me? If it sucks, they’re going to think I suck, right?” We had a mental model for how people used software that was years out of date. Bit by bit, customers tore apart our seemingly brilliant initial strategy. I had committed the biggest waste of all: building a product that our customers refused to use. One last refuge for people aching to justify their own failure. I consoled myself that if we hadn’t built this first product - mistakes and all - we never would have learned these important insights about customers. We never would have learned that our strategy was flawed. There is truth in this excuse: what we learned during those critical early months set IMVU on a path that would lead to our eventual breakout success. For a time, this “learning” consolation made me feel better, but my relief was short-lived. Here’s the question that bothered me most of all: if the goal of those months was to learn these important insights about customers, why did it take so long? How much of our effort contributed to the essential lessons we needed to learn? Could we have learned those lessons earlier if I hadn’t been so focused on making the product “better” by adding features and fixing bugs? VALUE VS. WASTE In other words, which of our efforts are value-creating and which are wasteful? Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste. But in a startup, who the customer is and what the customer might find valuable are unknown. What we had learned over those first months about what creates value for customers. Anything we had done during those months that did not contribute to our learning was a form of waste. Would it have been possible to learn the same things with less effort? Think of all the debate and prioritization of effort that went into features that customers would never discover. If we had shipped sooner, we could have avoided that waste. Also consider all the waste caused by our incorrect strategic assumptions. I had built interoperability for more than a dozen different IM clients and networks. Was this really necessary to test our assumptions? Could we have gotten the same feedback from our customers with half as many networks? With only three? With only one? Since the customers of all IM networks found our product equally unattractive, the level of learning would have been the same, but our effort would have been dramatically less. Did we have to support any networks at all? Is it possible that we could have discovered how flawed our assumptions were without building anything? For example, what if we simply had offered customers the opportunity to download the product from us solely on the basis of its proposed features before building anything? (Note that this is different from asking customers what they want. Most of the time customers don’t know what they want in advance.) Learning is the essential unit of progress for startups. The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this validated learning because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup’s core metrics. As we’ve seen, it’s easy to kid yourself about what you think customers want. It’s also easy to learn things that are completely irrelevant. Thus, validated learning is backed up by empirical data collected from real customers. Certainly our stories of failure were entertaining, and we had fascinating theories about what we had done wrong and what we needed to do to create a more successful product. However, the proof did not come until we put those theories into practice and built subsequent versions of the product that showed superior results with actual customers. The hard work of discovering what customers really wanted and adjusting our product and strategy to meet those desires. It is often easier to raise money or acquire other resources when you have zero revenue, zero customers, and zero traction than when you have a small amount. Zero invites imagination, but small numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize. Everyone knows (or thinks he or she knows) stories of products that achieved breakthrough success overnight. As long as nothing has been released and no data have been collected, it is still possible to imagine overnight success in the future. Small numbers pour cold water on that hope. Learn to see every startup in any industry as a grand experiment. The question is not “Can this product be built?” In the modern economy, almost any product that can be imagined can be built. The more pertinent questions are “Should this product be built?” and “Can we build a sustainable business around this set of products and services?” To answer those questions, we need a method for systematically breaking down a business plan into its component parts and testing each part empirically. One of the most important lessons of the scientific method: if you cannot fail, you cannot learn. A true experiment follows the scientific method. It begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what is supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirically. Just as scientific experimentation is informed by theory, startup experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of every startup experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable business around that vision. To sell the shoes, Zappos had to interact with customers: taking payment, handling returns, and dealing with customer support. This is decidedly different from market research. If Zappos had relied on existing market research or conducted a survey, it could have asked what customers thought they wanted. By building a product instead, albeit a simple one, the company learned much more: 1. It had more accurate data about customer demand because it was observing real customer behavior, not asking hypothetical questions. 2. It put itself in a position to interact with real customers and learn about their needs. 3. It allowed itself to be surprised when customers behaved in unexpected ways, revealing information Zappos might not have known to ask about. For example, what if customers returned the shoes? Break It Down The first step would be to break down the grand vision into its component parts. The two most important assumptions entrepreneurs make are what I call the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. The value hypothesis tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it. The growth hypothesis tests how new customers will discover a product or service. The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback. This specification will be rooted in feedback on what is working today rather than in anticipation of what might work tomorrow. Traditionally, the product manager says, ‘I just want this.’ In response, the engineer says, ‘I’m going to build it.’ Instead, I try to push my team to first answer four questions: 1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve? 2. If there was a solution, would they buy it? 3. Would they buy it from us? 4. Can we build a solution for that problem?” The common tendency of product development is to skip straight to the fourth question and build a solution before confirming that customers have the problem. “Until we could figure out how to sell and make the product, it wasn’t worth spending any engineering time on.” Returning to India, Akshay joined the Village Laundry Services (VLS), created by Innosight Ventures. VLS began a series of experiments to test its business assumptions. For their first experiment, VLS mounted a consumer-grade laundry machine on the back of a pickup truck parked on a street corner in Bangalore. The experiment cost less than $8,000 and had the simple goal of proving that people would hand over their laundry and pay to have it cleaned. The entrepreneurs did not clean the laundry on the truck, which was more for marketing and show, but took it off-site to be cleaned and brought it back to their customers by the end of the day. The VLS team continued the experiment for a week, parking the truck on different street corners, digging deeper to discover all they could about their potential customers. They wanted to know how they could encourage people to come to the truck. Did cleaning speed matter? Was cleanliness a concern? What were people asking for when they left their laundry with them? They discovered that customers were happy to give them their laundry to clean. However, those customers were suspicious of the washing machine mounted on the back of the truck, concerned that VLS would take their laundry and run. To address that concern, VLS created a slightly more substantial mobile cart that looked more like a kiosk. VLS also experimented with parking the carts in front of a local minimarket chain. Further iterations helped VLS figure out which services people were most interested in and what price they were willing to pay. They discovered that customers often wanted their clothes ironed and were willing to pay double the price to get their laundry back in four hours rather than twenty-four hours. As a result of those early experiments, VLS created an end product that was a three-foot by four-foot mobile kiosk that included an energy-efficient, consumer-grade washing machine, a dryer, and an extra-long extension cord. The kiosk used Western detergents and was supplied daily with fresh clean water delivered by VLS. Since then, the Village Laundry Service has grown substantially, with fourteen locations operational in Bangalore, Mysore, and Mumbai. As CEO Akshay Mehra shared with me, “We have serviced 116,000 kgs. in 2010 (vs. 30,600 kg. in 2009). And almost 60 percent of the business is coming from repeat customers. We have serviced more than 10,000 customers in the past year alone across all the outlets.”5 VLS story was recounted by Elnor Rozenrot, formerly of Innosight Ventures. Additional detail was provided by Akshay Mehra. For more on the VLS, see the article in Harvard Business Review Their challenge is to overcome the prevailing management thinking that puts its faith in well-researched plans. Remember, planning is a tool that only works in the presence of a long and stable operating history. To apply the scientific method to a startup, we need to identify which hypotheses to test. I call the riskiest elements of a startup’s plan, the parts on which everything depends, leap-of-faith assumptions. The two most important assumptions are the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis. These give rise to tuning variables that control a startup’s engine of growth. Each iteration of a startup is an attempt to rev this engine to see if it will turn. Once it is running, the process repeats, shifting into higher and higher gears. Once clear on these leap-of-faith assumptions, the first step is to enter the Build phase as quickly as possible with a minimum viable product (MVP). The MVP is that version of the product that enables a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with a minimum amount of effort and the least amount of development time. Creating a MVP requires extra work: we must be able to measure its impact. For example, it is inadequate to build a prototype that is evaluated solely for internal quality by engineers and designers. We also need to get it in front of potential customers to gauge their reactions. When we enter the Measure phase, the biggest challenge will be determining whether the product development efforts are leading to real progress. The method I recommend is called innovation accounting, a quantitative approach that allows us to see whether our engine-tuning efforts are bearing fruit. It also allows us to create learning milestones, Finally, and most important, there’s the pivot. If we’ve discovered that one of our hypotheses is false, it is time to make a major change to a new strategic hypothesis. How Facebook was able to raise so much money when its actual usage was so small: By all accounts, what impressed investors the most were two facts about Facebook’s early growth. The first fact was the raw amount of time Facebook’s active users spent on the site. More than half of the users came back to the site every single day. This is an example of how a company can validate its value hypothesis - that customers find the product valuable. The second impressive thing about Facebook’s early traction was the rate at which it had taken over its first few college campuses. Facebook also had validated its growth hypothesis. These two hypotheses represent two of the most important leap-of-faith questions any new startup faces. Is the lesson of Facebook that startups should not charge customers money in the early days? Or is it that startups should never spend money on marketing? These questions cannot be answered in the abstract; Instead, as we saw in Part One, startups need to conduct experiments that help determine what techniques will work in their unique circumstances. For startups, the role of strategy is to help figure out the right questions to ask. Every business plan begins with a set of assumptions. It lays out a strategy that takes those assumptions as a given and proceeds to show how to achieve the company’s vision. Because the assumptions haven’t been proved to be true (they are assumptions, after all) and in fact are often erroneous, the goal of a startup’s early efforts should be to test them as quickly as possible. Assumptions that require more courage to state - in the present tense - with a straight face: we assume that customers have a significant desire to use a product like ours, or we assume that supermarkets will carry our product. Acting as if these assumptions are true is a classic entrepreneur superpower. They are called leaps of faith precisely because the success of the entire venture rests on them. If they are true, tremendous opportunity awaits. If they are false, the startup risks total failure. Venture capitalist Randy Komisar, whose book ""Getting to Plan B"" discussed the concept of leaps of faith in great detail, uses a framework of “analogs” and “antilogs” to plot strategy. What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly. Genchi gembutsu, which is one of the most important phrases in the lean manufacturing vocabulary. In English, it is usually translated as a directive to “go and see for yourself” so that business decisions can be based on deep firsthand knowledge. You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand. It is unacceptable to take anything for granted or to rely on the reports of others. Craft a customer archetype, a brief document that seeks to humanize the proposed target customer. This archetype is an essential guide for product development and ensures that the daily prioritization decisions that every product team must make are aligned with the customer to whom the company aims to appeal. A minimum viable product (MVP) is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. The goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses. Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too polished: if it’s ready for everyone to adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? As a result, additional features or polish beyond what early adopters demand is a form of wasted resources and time. Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. They prefer that state of affairs, because what they care about above all is being the first Most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify. Most entrepreneurs approach a question like this by building the product and then checking to see how customers react to it. I consider this to be exactly backward because it can lead to a lot of waste. First, if it turns out that we’re building something nobody wants, the whole exercise will be an avoidable expense of time and money. If customers won’t sign up for the free trial, they’ll never get to experience the amazing features that await them. Even if they do sign up, there are many other opportunities for waste. For example, how many features do we really need to include to appeal to early adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time. The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time. (Dropbox:) To avoid the risk of waking up after years of development with a product nobody wanted, Drew did something unexpectedly easy: he made a video. The video is banal, a simple three-minute demonstration of the technology as it is meant to work. Only at the point where the founders were too busy to bring on additional customers did Manuel and his team start to invest in automation Always focused on scaling something that was working rather than trying to invent something that might work in the future. Contrast this with the case of a small business, in which it is routine to see the CEO, founder, president, and owner serving customers directly, one at a time. In a concierge MVP, this personalized service is not the product but a learning activity designed to test the leap-of-faith assumptions in the company’s growth model. “We continued to run with humans replicating pieces of the backend for nine months. We hired eight people to manage queries, classify conversations, etc. We actually raised our seed and series A rounds before the system was automated. As we refined the product, we would bring in six to twelve people weekly to react to mockups, prototypes, or simulations that we were working on. It was a mix of existing users and people who never saw the product before. We had our engineers join for many of these sessions, both so that they could make modifications in real time, but also so we could all experience the pain of a user not knowing what to do.” If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is. As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek. The most common objection I have heard over the years to building an MVP is fear of competitors - especially large established companies - stealing a startup’s ideas. I have often given entrepreneurs fearful of this issue the following assignment: take one of your ideas (one of your lesser insights, perhaps), find the name of the relevant product manager at an established company who has responsibility for that area, and try to get that company to steal your idea. Call them up, write them a memo, send them a press release - go ahead, try it. The truth is that most managers in most companies are already overwhelmed with good ideas. Their challenge lies in prioritization and execution. If a competitor can outexecute a startup once the idea is known, the startup is doomed anyway. You believe you can accelerate through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop faster than anyone else can. If that’s true, it makes no difference what the competition knows. If it’s not true, a startup has much bigger problems, and secrecy won’t fix them. Sooner or later, a successful startup will face competition from fast followers. The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else. MVP can seem like a dangerous branding risk. Easy solution: launch the MVP under a different brand name. Experiment under the radar and then do a public marketing launch once the product has proved itself with real customers. Prepare for the fact that MVPs often result in bad news. The solution to this dilemma is a commitment to iteration. You have to commit to a locked-in agreement - ahead of time - that no matter what comes of testing the MVP, you will not give up hope. A startup’s job is to (1) rigorously measure where it is right now, confronting the hard truths that assessment reveals, and then (2) devise experiments to learn how to move the real numbers closer to the ideal reflected in the business plan. A simple question that I make a habit of asking startups whenever we meet: Are you making your product better? They always say yes. Then I ask: how do you know? I invariably get this answer: well, we are in engineering and we made a number of changes last month, and our customers seem to like them, and our overall numbers are higher this month. We must be on the right track. This is the kind of storytelling that takes place at most startup board meetings. Most milestones are built the same way: hit a certain product milestone, maybe talk to a few customers, and see if the numbers go up. Unfortunately, this is not a good indicator of whether a startup is making progress. How do we know that the changes we’ve made are related to the results we’re seeing? More important, how do we know that we are drawing the right lessons from those changes? To answer these kinds of questions, startups have a strong need for a new kind of accounting geared specifically to disruptive innovation. Innovation accounting works in three steps: (1) Use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now. (2) Startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. This may take many attempts. After the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimizations it can to move its baseline toward the ideal, the company reaches a decision point. That is the third step: (3) Pivot or persevere. If the company is making good progress toward the ideal, that means it’s learning appropriately and using that learning effectively, in which case it makes sense to continue. If not, the management team eventually must conclude that its current product strategy is flawed and needs a serious change. When a company pivots, it starts the process all over again, reestablishing a new baseline and then tuning the engine from there. The sign of a successful pivot is that these engine-tuning activities are more productive after the pivot than before. Smoke test with its marketing materials. This is an old direct marketing technique in which customers are given the opportunity to preorder a product that has not yet been built. A smoke test measures only one thing: whether customers are interested in trying a product. By itself, this is insufficient to validate an entire growth model. Nonetheless, it can be very useful to get feedback on this assumption. These MVPs provide the first example of a learning milestone. Test the riskiest assumptions first. For example, a company might spend time improving the design of its product to make it easier for new customers to use. This presupposes that the activation rate of new customers is a driver of growth and that its baseline is lower than the company would like. To demonstrate validated learning, the design changes must improve the activation rate of new customers. If they do not, the new design should be judged a failure. This is an important rule: a good design is one that changes customer behavior for the better. Five dollars bought us a hundred clicks - every day. From a marketing point of view this was not very significant, but for learning it was priceless. Every single day we were able to measure our product’s performance with a brand new set of customers. Also, each time we revised the product, we got a brand new report card on how we were doing the very next day. Cohort analysis. This is one of the most important tools of startup analytics. Although it sounds complex, it is based on a simple premise. Instead of looking at cumulative totals or gross numbers such as total revenue and total number of customers, one looks at the performance of each group of customers that comes into contact with the product independently. Each group is called a cohort. Every company depends for its survival on sequences of customer behavior called flows. Customer flows govern the interaction of customers with a company’s products. They allow us to understand a business quantitatively and have much more predictive power than do traditional gross metrics. The sign of a successful pivot: the new experiments you run are overall more productive than the experiments you were running before. This is the pattern: poor quantitative results force us to declare failure and create the motivation, context, and space for more qualitative research. These investigations produce new ideas - new hypotheses - to be tested, leading to a possible pivot. Each pivot unlocks new opportunities for further experimentation, and the cycle repeats. Each time we repeat this simple rhythm: establish the baseline, tune the engine, and make a decision to pivot or persevere. Tools for product improvement do not work the same way for startups. If you are building the wrong thing, optimizing the product or its marketing will not yield significant results. A startup has to measure progress against a high bar: evidence that a sustainable business can be built around its products or services. That’s a standard that can be assessed only if a startup has made clear, tangible predictions ahead of time. In the absence of those predictions, product and strategy decisions are far more difficult and time-consuming. Because Grockit was using the wrong kinds of metrics, the startup was not genuinely improving. Farb was frustrated in his efforts to learn from customer feedback. In every cycle, the type of metrics his team was focused on would change: one month they would look at gross usage numbers, another month registration numbers, and so on. Those metrics would go up and down seemingly on their own. He couldn’t draw clear cause-and-effect inferences. Prioritizing work correctly in such an environment is extremely challenging. Farb could have asked his data analyst to investigate a particular question. For example, when we shipped feature X, did it affect customer behavior? But that would have required tremendous time and effort. When, exactly, did feature X ship? Which customers were exposed to it? Was anything else launched around that same time? Were there seasonal factors that might be skewing the data? Finding these answers would have required parsing reams and reams of data. The answer often would come weeks after the question had been asked. In the meantime, the team would have moved on to new priorities and new questions that needed urgent attention. Grockit changed the metrics they used to evaluate success in two ways. Instead of looking at gross metrics, Grockit switched to cohort-based metrics, and instead of looking for cause-and-effect relationships after the fact, Grockit would launch each new feature as a true split-test experiment. A split-test experiment is one in which different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time. By observing the changes in behavior between the two groups, one can make inferences about the impact of the different variations. Although working with split tests seems to be more difficult because it requires extra accounting and metrics to keep track of each variation, it almost always saves tremendous amounts of time. User stories were not considered complete until they led to validated learning. Thus, stories could be cataloged as being in one of four states of development: in the product backlog, actively being built, done (feature complete from a technical point of view), or in the process of being validated. Validated was defined as “knowing whether the story was a good idea to have been done in the first place.” This validation usually would come in the form of a split test showing a change in customer behavior but also might include customer interviews or surveys. The kanban rule permitted only so many stories in each of the four states. As stories flow from one state to the other, the buckets fill up. Once a bucket becomes full, it cannot accept more stories. Only when a story has been validated can it be removed from the kanban board. If the validation fails and it turns out the story is a bad idea, the relevant feature is removed from the product. I have implemented this system with several teams, and the initial result is always frustrating: each bucket fills up, starting with the “validated” bucket and moving on to the “done” bucket, until it’s not possible to start any more work. The only way to start work on new features is to investigate some of the stories that are done but haven’t been validated. If they include the validation exercise from the beginning, the whole team can be more productive. For example, why build a new feature that is not part of a split-test experiment? It may save you time in the short run, but it will take more time later to test, during the validation phase. The three A’s of metrics: actionable, accessible, and auditable. Actionable: For a report to be considered actionable, it must demonstrate clear cause and effect. Make the reports as simple as possible so that everyone understands them. Cohort-based reports are the gold standard of learning metrics: they turn complex actions into people-based reports. Each cohort analysis says: among the people who used our product in this period, here’s how many of them exhibited each of the behaviors we care about. Each employee could log in to the system at any time, choose from a list of all current and past experiments, and see a simple one-page summary of the results. Be able to check if the reports contain true facts. Managers need the ability to spot check the data with real customers. Gain insights into why customers are behaving the way the data indicate. Reports should be drawn directly from the master data, rather than from an intermediate system, which reduces opportunities for error. There is no bigger destroyer of creative potential than the misguided decision to persevere. Companies that cannot bring themselves to pivot to a new direction on the basis of feedback from the marketplace can get stuck in the land of the living dead, neither growing enough nor dying, consuming resources and commitment from employees. David had identified his leap-of-faith questions explicitly at the outset and, more important, had made quantitative predictions about each of them. It is only because David focused on actionable metrics for each of his leap-of-faith questions that he was able to accept that his company was failing. Because David had not wasted energy on premature PR, he was able to make this determination without public embarrassment or distraction. A pivot requires that we keep one foot rooted in what we’ve learned so far, while making a fundamental change in strategy in order to seek even greater validated learning. A STARTUP’S RUNWAY IS THE NUMBER OF PIVOTS IT CAN STILL MAKE Get to each pivot faster. In other words, the startup has to find ways to achieve the same amount of validated learning at lower cost or in a shorter time. All the techniques in the Lean Startup model that have been discussed so far have this as their overarching goal. The failure of the “launch it and see what happens” approach should now be evident: you will always succeed - in seeing what happens. Except in rare cases, the early results will be ambiguous, and you won’t know whether to pivot or persevere, whether to change direction or stay the course. Entrepreneurs need to face their fears and be willing to fail, often in a public way. In fact, entrepreneurs who have a high profile, either because of personal fame or because they are operating as part of a famous brand, face an extreme version of this problem. I recommend that every startup have a regular “pivot or persevere” meeting. Remember that the rationale for building low-quality MVPs is that developing any features beyond what early adopters require is a form of waste. However, the logic of this takes you only so far. Once you have found success with early adopters, you want to sell to mainstream customers. Mainstream customers have different requirements and are much more demanding. The kind of pivot we needed is called a customer segment pivot. In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it’s building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is confirmed only partially. The very actions that made us successful with early adopters were diametrically opposed to the actions we’d have to master to be successful with mainstream customers. ""Pivot"" sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for change. A pivot is a special kind of change designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, business model, and engine of growth. A CATALOG OF PIVOTS A platform pivot. Instead of selling an application to one customer at a time, David envisioned a new growth model inspired by Google’s AdWords platform. He built a self-serve sales platform where anyone could become a customer with just a credit card. Zoom-in Pivot In this case, what previously was considered a single feature in a product becomes the whole product. A zoom-in pivot, refocusing the product on what previously had been considered just one feature of a larger whole. Zoom-out Pivot In the reverse situation, sometimes a single feature is insufficient to support a whole product. In this type of pivot, what was considered the whole product becomes a single feature of a much larger product. Customer Segment Pivot In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it is building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the type of customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is partially confirmed, solving the right problem, but for a different customer than originally anticipated. A customer segment pivot, keeping the functionality of the product the same but changing the audience focus. In other words, David went from being a business-to-consumer (B2C) company to being a business-to-business (B2B) company. Customer Need Pivot: The problem we’re trying to solve for them is not very important. However, because of this customer intimacy, we often discover other related problems that are important and can be solved by our team. The target customer has a problem worth solving, just not the one that was originally anticipated. Platform Pivot A platform pivot refers to a change from an application to a platform or vice versa. Most commonly, startups that aspire to create a new platform begin life by selling a single application, the so-called killer app, for their platform. Only later does the platform emerge as a vehicle for third parties to leverage as a way to create their own related products. Business Architecture Pivot: a startup switches architectures. Some companies change from high margin, low volume by going mass market (e.g., Google’s search “appliance”); others, originally designed for the mass market, turned out to require long and expensive sales cycles. Value Capture Pivot: capturing value is an intrinsic part of the product - and changes to the way a company captures value can have far-reaching consequences for the rest of the business, product, and marketing strategies. Engine of Growth Pivot: three primary engines of growth that power startups: the viral, sticky, and paid growth models. In this type of pivot, a company changes its growth strategy to seek faster or more profitable growth. Commonly but not always, the engine of growth also requires a change in the way value is captured. Channel Pivot: the sales channel or distribution channel. For example, consumer packaged goods are sold in a grocery store, cars are sold in dealerships, and much enterprise software is sold (with extensive customization) by consulting and professional services firms. Often, the requirements of the channel determine the price, features, and competitive landscape of a product. A channel pivot is a recognition that the same basic solution could be delivered through a different channel with greater effectiveness. It is precisely because of its destructive effect on sales channels that the Internet has had such a disruptive influence in industries that previously required complex sales and distribution channels, such as newspaper, magazine, and book publishing. Technology Pivot: Occasionally, a company discovers a way to achieve the same solution by using a completely different technology. Technology pivots are much more common in established businesses. Technology life cycle ideas of theorists such as Geoffrey Moore know certain later-stage pivots by the names he has given them: the Chasm, the Tornado, the Bowling Alley. Modern managers cannot have escaped the deluge of recent books calling on them to adapt, change, reinvent, or upend their existing businesses. Many of the works in this category are long on exhortations and short on specifics. On the page, these processes may seem clinical, slow, and simple. In the real world, something different is needed. We have learned to steer when moving slowly. Now we must learn to race. Laying a solid foundation is only the first step toward our real destination: acceleration. Which activities create value and which are a form of waste? Once you understand this distinction, you can begin using lean techniques to drive out waste and increase the efficiency of the value-creating activities. What products do customers really want? How will our business grow? Who is our customer? Which customers should we listen to and which should we ignore? These are the questions that need answering as quickly as possible The one envelope at a time approach is called “single-piece flow” in lean manufacturing. It works because of the surprising power of small batches. When we do work that proceeds in stages, the “batch size” refers to how much work moves from one stage to the next at a time. In process-oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system. Instead of working in separate departments, engineers and designers would work together side by side on one feature at a time. Whenever that feature was ready to be tested with customers, they immediately would release a new version of the product, which would go live on our website for a relatively small number of people. The team would be able immediately to assess the impact of their work, evaluate its effect on customers, and decide what to do next. For tiny changes, the whole process might be repeated several times per day. In School of One, students have daily “playlists” of their learning tasks that are attuned to each student’s learning needs, based on that student’s readiness and learning style. There are assessments built into each activity so that data can be fed back to the teacher to choose appropriate tasks for the next playlist. The longer we worked, the more afraid we became of how customers would react when they finally saw the new version. As our plans became more ambitious, so too did the number of bugs, conflicts, and problems we had to deal with. Pretty soon we got into a situation in which we could not ship anything. Our launch date seemed to recede into the distance. The more work we got done, the more work we had to do. The lack of ability to ship eventually precipitated a crisis and a change of management, all because of the trap of large batches. Lean production solves the problem of stockouts with a technique called pull. When you bring a car into the dealership for repair, one blue 2011 Camry bumper gets used. This creates a “hole” in the dealer’s inventory, which automatically causes a signal to be sent to a local restocking facility called the Toyota Parts Distribution Center (PDC). The PDC sends the dealer a new bumper, which creates another hole in inventory. This sends a similar signal to a regional warehouse called the Toyota Parts Redistribution Center (PRC), where all parts suppliers ship their products. That warehouse signals the factory where the bumpers are made to produce one more bumper, which is manufactured and shipped to the PRC. The ideal goal is to achieve small batches all the way down to single-piece flow along the entire supply chain. Each step in the line pulls the parts it needs from the previous step. This is the famous Toyota just-in-time production method.8 The amount of just-in-case inventory [called work-in-progress (WIP) inventory] is reduced dramatically. All the work that goes into designing the minimum viable product is - until the moment that product is shipped - just WIP inventory. Incomplete designs, not-yet-validated assumptions, and most business plans are WIP. Almost every Lean Startup technique we’ve discussed so far works its magic in two ways: by converting push methods to pull and reducing batch size. Both have the net effect of reducing WIP. Customers often don’t know what they want. Our goal in building products is to be able to run experiments that will help us learn how to build a sustainable business. Thus, the right way to think about the product development process in a Lean Startup is that it is responding to pull requests in the form of experiments that need to be run. As soon as we formulate a hypothesis that we want to test, the product development team should be engineered to design and run this experiment as quickly as possible, using the smallest batch size that will get the job done. Remember that although we write the feedback loop as Build-Measure-Learn because the activities happen in that order, our planning really works in the reverse order: we figure out what we need to learn and then work backwards to see what product will work as an experiment to get that learning. Thus, it is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is waste. Toyota has built the most advanced learning organization in history. It has demonstrated an ability to unleash the creativity of its employees, achieve consistent growth, and produce innovative new products relentlessly over the course of nearly a century.11 This is the kind of long-term success to which entrepreneurs should aspire. Although lean production techniques are powerful, they are only a manifestation of a high-functioning organization that is committed to achieving maximum performance by employing the right measures of progress over the long term. Process is only the foundation upon which a great company culture can develop. But without this foundation, efforts to encourage learning, creativity, and innovation will fall flat - as Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers. There are four primary ways past customers drive sustainable growth: 1. Word of mouth. Embedded in most products is a natural level of growth that is caused by satisfied customers’ enthusiasm for the product. 2. As a side effect of product usage. Fashion or status, such as luxury goods products, drive awareness of themselves whenever they are used. 3. Through funded advertising. For this to be a source of sustainable growth, the advertising must be paid for out of revenue, not one-time sources such as investment capital. As long as the cost of acquiring a new customer (the so-called marginal cost) is less than the revenue that customer generates (the marginal revenue), the excess (the marginal profit) can be used to acquire more customers. The more marginal profit, the faster the growth. 4. Through repeat purchase or use. Some products are designed to be purchased repeatedly either through a subscription plan (a cable company) or through voluntary repurchases (groceries or lightbulbs). By contrast, many products and services are intentionally designed as one-time events, such as wedding planning. These sources of sustainable growth power feedback loops that I have termed engines of growth. Each is like a combustion engine, turning over and over. The faster the loop turns, the faster the company will grow. Each engine has an intrinsic set of metrics that determine how fast a company can grow when using it. Startups don’t starve; they drown. Startups have to focus on the big experiments that lead to validated learning. The engines of growth framework helps them stay focused on the metrics that matter. Companies using the sticky engine of growth track their attrition rate or churn rate very carefully. The churn rate is defined as the fraction of customers in any period who fail to remain engaged with the company’s product. The rules that govern the sticky engine of growth are pretty simple: if the rate of new customer acquisition exceeds the churn rate, the product will grow. The speed of growth is determined by what I call the rate of compounding, which is simply the natural growth rate minus the churn rate. Focus needs to be on improving customer retention. This goes against the standard intuition in that if a company lacks growth, it should invest more in sales and marketing. This counterintuitive result is hard to infer from standard vanity metrics. THE THREE ENGINES OF GROWTH: (1) = The Sticky Engine of Growth (2) = The Viral Engine of Growth: Depend on person-to-person transmission as a necessary consequence of normal product use. Customers are not intentionally acting as evangelists; they are not necessarily trying to spread the word about the product. Growth happens automatically as a side effect of customers using the product. Viruses are not optional. The viral engine is powered by a feedback loop that can be quantified. It is called the viral loop, and its speed is determined by a single mathematical term called the viral coefficient. The higher this coefficient is, the faster the product will spread. The viral coefficient measures how many new customers will use a product as a consequence of each new customer who signs up. For a product with a viral coefficient of 0.1, one in every ten customers will recruit one of his or her friends. This is not a sustainable loop. Imagine that one hundred customers sign up. They will cause ten friends to sign up. Those ten friends will cause one additional person to sign up, but there the loop will fizzle out. By contrast, a viral loop with a coefficient that is greater than 1.0 will grow exponentially, because each person who signs up will bring, on average, more than one other person Companies that rely on the viral engine of growth must focus on increasing the viral coefficient more than anything else, because even tiny changes in this number will cause dramatic changes in their future prospects. Many viral products do not charge customers directly but rely on indirect sources of revenue such as advertising. This is the case because viral products cannot afford to have any friction impede the process of signing customers up and recruiting their friends. This can make testing the value hypothesis for viral products especially challenging. The true test of the value hypothesis is always a voluntary exchange of value between customers and the startup that serves them. A lot of confusion stems from the fact that this exchange can be monetary, as in the case of Tupperware, or nonmonetary, as in the case of Facebook. In the viral engine of growth, monetary exchange does not drive new growth; it is useful only as an indicator that customers value the product enough to pay for it. If Facebook or Hotmail had started charging customers in their early days, it would have been foolish, as it would have impeded their ability to grow. However, it is not true that customers do not give these companies something of value: by investing their time and attention in the product, they make the product valuable to advertisers. Each customer pays a certain amount of money for the product over his or her “lifetime” as a customer. Once variable costs are deducted, this usually is called the customer lifetime value (LTV). This revenue can be invested in growth by buying advertising. Suppose an advertisement costs $100 and causes fifty new customers to sign up for the service. This ad has a cost per acquisition (CPA) of $2.00. In this example, if the product has an LTV that is greater than $2, the product will grow. The margin between the LTV and the CPA determines how fast the paid engine of growth will turn (this is called the marginal profit). Conversely, if the CPA remains at $2.00 but the LTV falls below $2.00, the company’s growth will slow. (3) = The Paid Engine of Growth Startups that employ an outbound sales force are also using this engine, as are retail companies that rely on foot traffic. All these costs should be factored into the cost per acquisition. The startup had an “unlimited” pricing plan, its most expensive, that cost only a few hundred dollars per month. The NGO literally could not make the purchase because it had no process in place for buying something so inexpensive. Additionally, the NGO needed substantial help in managing the rollout, educating its staff on the new tool, and tracking the impact of the change; those were all services the company was ill equipped to offer. Changing customer segments required them to switch to hiring a sizable outbound sales staff that spent time attending conferences, educating executives, and authoring white papers. Those much higher costs came with a corresponding reward: the company switched from making only a few dollars per customer to making tens and then hundreds of thousands of dollars per much larger customer. Their new engine of growth led to sustained success. Advertising that is targeted to more affluent customers generally costs more than advertising that reaches the general public. What determines these prices is the average value earned in aggregate by the companies that are in competition for any given customer’s attention. Wealthy consumers cost more to reach because they tend to become more profitable customers. Over time, any source of customer acquisition will tend to have its CPA bid up by this competition. Successful startups usually focus on just one engine of growth, specializing in everything that is required to make it work. I strongly recommend that startups focus on one engine at a time. ENGINES OF GROWTH DETERMINE PRODUCT/MARKET FIT Product/market fit to describe the moment when a startup finally finds a widespread set of customers that resonate with its product: Conversely, in a terrible market, you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team, and it doesn’t matter - you’re going to fail.3 To many entrepreneurs it implies that a pivot is a failure event - “our startup has failed to achieve product/market fit.” It also implies the inverse - that once our product has achieved product/market fit, we won’t have to pivot anymore. Both assumptions are wrong. If a startup is attempting to use the viral engine of growth, it can focus its development efforts on things that might affect customer behavior - on the viral loop - and safely ignore those that do not. Such a startup does not need to specialize in marketing, advertising, or sales functions. Conversely, a company using the paid engine needs to develop those marketing and sales functions urgently. What really matters is not the raw numbers or vanity metrics but the direction and degree of progress. Overarchitecture failure, in which attempting to prevent all the various kinds of problems that could occur wound up delaying the company from putting out any product. Friendster effect, suffering a high-profile technical failure just when customer adoption is going wild. One of the most important discoveries of the lean manufacturing movement: you cannot trade quality for time. If you are causing (or missing) quality problems now, the resulting defects will slow you down later. Defects cause a lot of rework, low morale, and customer complaints, all of which slow progress and eat away at valuable resources. Use a system called the Five Whys to make incremental investments and evolve a startup’s processes gradually. The core idea of Five Whys is to tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms. The system takes its name from the investigative method of asking the question “Why?” five times to understand what has happened (the root cause). At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem. Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be. Chronic problems are caused by bad process, not bad people, and remedy them accordingly. Managers and employees can fall into the trap of using the Five Blames as a means for venting their frustrations and calling out colleagues for systemic failures. We routinely asked new engineers to make a change to the production environment on their first day. “If our production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very first day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so.” Everyone came through it with a visceral understanding of our values. Ask teams to adopt these simple rules: 1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time. 2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.",The methodology here is the one I recommend the most. The stuff I preach is like a cute casual intro to the real deal: the Lean Startup methodology. (As an aside: this book is the one that pushed my book out of the #1 slot on Amazon's Entrepreneur charts. Quite an honor.)
Seeking Wisdom,Peter Bevelin,1578644283,6,"If we understand what influences us, we might avoid certain traps and understand why others act like they do. We can't eliminate mistakes, but we can prevent those that can really hurt us. Master the best that other people have ever figured out. Don't just try to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart. Anyone who wishes to be cured of ignorance must first admit to it. Reading books is like conversation with the finest minds of past centuries. Absorb elementary worldly widsom. It makes you better able to serve others, serve yourself, and makes life more fun. I'm passionate about wisdom, accuracy, and some kinds of curiosity. The advice we give others is the advice that we ourselves need. If people expect something to go wrong with their health, it often does. What we do today is a function of what worked in the past. Altruism can often be explained by self-benefit: social recognition, prestige, relief from distress. Mutual aid has tremendous survival value. The strategy that is effective in the long run: tit-for-tat. Cooperate at the first meeting, then do whatever our opponent did last time. Failure to detect threats is more costly than false alarms. (Evolutionary, biologically.) The more we are exposed to a stimulus, the higher our threshold of fear becomes. Finding new ways to deal with the world is superior to overtraining old patterns. Stay away from garages on big highways. Such mechanics know they'll never see you again. Go to a neighborhood garage, where word-of-mouth serves as advertising. Reputation matters. It pays to be nice when others are watching. Teach generosity and altruism, because we are both selfish. The more emotional, confused, uncertain, insecure, excited, distracted, tired, or stressed we are, the easier we make mistakes. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 28 REASONS FOR MISJUDGEMENTS AND MISTAKES: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ## 1. Bias from mere association - automatically connecting a stimulus with pain or pleasure; including liking or disliking something associated with something bad or good. Includes seeing situations as identical because they seem similar. Also bias from Persian Messenger Syndrome - not wanting to be the carrier of bad news. ## 2. Underestimating the power of rewards and punishment - people repeat actions that result in rewards and avoid actions that they are punished for. If people don't have to pay for a benefit, they often overuse it. After a success, we become overly optimistic risk-takers. After a failure, we become overly pessimistic and risk-averse, even in cases where success or failure was merely a result of chance. We do not improve the man we hang. We improve others by him. Incentives to performance: make people share both the upside and downside. Make them understand the link between their performance, their reward, and what you finally want to accomplish. Reward individual performance, not effort or length in organization. ## 3. Underestimating bias from own self-interest and incentives. We never look at projections, but we look very deeply at track records. It's naive to think that projections have any utility whatsoever. Do not train learning by force. Lead them by what amuses them. Convince people by asking questions that illuminate consequences. ## 4. Self-serving bias - overly positive view of our abilities and future. Includes over-optimism. The more we think we know about a subject, the less willing we are to use other ideas. We solve a problem in a way that agrees with our area of expertise. Try to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent. It's the strong swimmers who drown. Ask: How can I be wrong? Who can tell me if I'm wrong? Successes draw far more attention than failures. ## 5. Self-deception and denial- distortion of reality to reduce pain or increase pleasure. Includes wishful thinking. ## 6. Bias from consistency tendency - being consistent with our prior commitments and ideas even when acting against our best interest or in the face of disconfirming evidence. Includes confirmation bias - looking for evidence that confirms our actions and beliefs and ignoring or distorting disconfirming evidence. We look for evidence that confirms our ideas, beliefs, and actions. When we've made an investment or entered into a relationship, we tend to seek out evidence confirming that it was the right decision and to ignore information that shows it was wrong. The more public a decision is, the less likely it is that we will change it. We don't have a strategic plan. Thus we feel no need to proceed in an ordained direction, but can instead simply decide what makes sense. The task of man is not to see what lies dimly in the distance, but to do what lies dearly at hand. Respond intelligently and diligently to the information and challenges at hand. Make it voluntary, for people to take inner responsibility for their actions. When internally motivated by satisfaction or interest, we feel in control, free from incentives or outside pressure. Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies. To say you are wrong is saying you are wiser today than yesterday. When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. ## 7. Bias from deprival syndrome - strongly reacting (including desiring and valuing more) when something we like and have (or almost have) is (or threatens to be) taken away or ""lost."" Includes desiring and valuing more what we can't have or what is (or threatens less available to be). In investing, it's a mistake to try to make it back the way you lost it. People respond to immediate crisis and threats. Anything that happens gradually, they tend to put off If we want people to take a risk, we should make them feel behind (losing). If we want them to stay with the status quo or reject risk, we should make them feel safe. ## 8. Status quo bias and do-nothing syndrome - keeping things the way they are. Includes minimizing effort and a preference for default options. Predicting rain doesn't count; building arks does. It took Noah 20 years to build an ark. And people said he was being silly because the skies were beautiful. And of course, the whole time, he looked stupid - until it started raining. You can spend a long time building an ark while everybody else is out there enjoying the sun. Make yourself do the thing you have to do when it ought to be done whether you like it or not. ## 9. Impatience - valuing the present more highly than the future. ## 10. Bias from envy and jealousy. Man will do many things to get himself loved; he will do all things to get himself envied. ## 11. Distortion by contrast comparison - judging and perceiving the absolute magnitude of something not by itself but based only on its difference to something else presented closely in time or space or to some earlier adaptation level. Also underestimating the consequences over time of gradual changes. ## 12. Bias from anchoring - over-weighing certain initial information as a reference point for future decisions. ## 13. Over-influence by vivid or the most recent information. Back up vivid stories with facts and numbers. ## 14. Omission and abstract blindness - only seeing stimuli we encounter or that grabs our attention, and neglecting important missing information or the abstract. Includes inattentional blindness. Today 14 million people didn't win the lottery. We don't see the quiet losers. We don't see those who didn't predict well. Missing information doesn't draw our attention. ## 15. Bias from reciprocation tendency - repaying in kind what others have done for or to us like favors, concessions, information and attitudes. Our managers are independently wealthy. They don't need to get up and go to work at all. So I've got to create an environment where they thing they want to do most in the world is go to work. What would make me feel that way? People don't want to feel indebted. Allow people to give back what we've given them. ## 16. Bias from over-influence by liking tendency - believing, trusting and agreeing with people we know and like. Includes bias from over-desire for liking and social acceptance and for avoiding social disapproval. Also bias from disliking - our tendency to avoid and disagree with people we don't like. Talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours. ## 17. Bias from over-influence by social proof - imitating the behavior of many others or similar others. Includes crowd folly. When all are accountable, no one is accountable. ## 18. Bias from over-influence by authority - trusting and obeying a perceived authority or expert. After the break-in at John's office, he said: ""Of course, I believed he was a security guard, since he had a uniform."" ## 19. Sensemaking - Constructing explanations that fit an outcome. Includes being too quick in drawing conclusions. Also thinking events that have happened were more predictable than they were. Everything seems stupid when it fails. In hindsight, everything seems obvious. Look at earlier decisions in the context of their own time. If our predictions have been a little better than other people's, it's because we've tried to make fewer of them. ## 20. Reason-respecting - complying with requests merely because we've been given a reason. Includes underestimating the power in giving people reasons. If you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. You cannot reason a person out of a position he did not reason himself into in the first place. People are more moved by what they feel than by what they understand. ## 21. Believing first and doubting later - believing what is not true, especially when distracted. ## 22. Memory limitations - remembering selectively and wrong. Includes influence by suggestions. ## 23. Do-something syndrome - acting without a sensible reason. Man finds nothing so intolerable as to be in a state of complete rest, without passions, without occupation, without diversion, without effort. ## 24. Mental confusion from say-something syndrome - feeling a need to say something when we have nothing to say. I have often regretted my speech, never my silence. ## 25. Emotional arousal- making hasty judgments under the influence of intense emotions. Includes exaggerating the emotional impact of future events. ## 26. Mental confusion from stress. I have no stress whatsoever - zero. I get to do what I love to do every day. I'm surrounded by people that are terrific. All the businesses I run don't take 5% of my time. We don't have regular staff meetings. If you've got good businesses and the right managers, you don't need that sort of thing. It is not stress that harms us but distress. Complete freedom from stress is death. ## 27. Mental confusion from physical or psychological pain, the influence of chemicals or diseases. ## 28. Bias from over-influence by the combined effect of many psychological tendencies operating together. Once they start stealing, the consistency principle will make stealing habitual. It's very very important to create human systems that are hard to cheat. =========== No man was fit to hold public office who wasn't perfectly willing to leave it at any time. You can learn to make fewer mistakes than other people - and how to fix your mistakes faster when you do make them. Get so you can handle mistakes. People go broke because they can't stop, rethink and say, ""I can afford to write this one off and live to fight again. I don't have to pursue this thing as an obsession."" You must learn how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. I now use a two-track analysis: One approach is rationality. Evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities. The other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions - many of which are wrong. Take all the main models from psychology and use them as a checklist in reviewing outcomes in complex systems. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ MISJUDGEMENTS AND MISTAKES: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #### 1. Systems thinking ** Failing to consider that actions have both intended and unintended consequences. Includes failing to consider secondary and higher order consequences and inevitable implications. By solving one problem, we generate another one and sometimes create an even worse one. ** Failing to consider the whole system in which actions and reactions take place, the important factors that make up the system, their relationships and effects of changes on system outcome. Try to optimize the whole and not a system's individual parts. ** Failing to consider the likely reactions of others - what is best to do may depend on what others do. ** Failing to consider the implications of winning a bid - overestimating value and paying too much. Auction: What you won was the right to pay more for something than everyone else thought it was worth. The other party is most likely to accept our offer when it is least favorable to us. ** Overestimating predictive ability or using unknowable factors in making predictions. Nobody can forecast interest or currency rates, the GDP, turning points in the economy, the stock market, etc. Massive amounts of information don't help. #### 2. Scale and limits ** Failing to consider that changes in size or time influence form, function and behavior. Adding $20k to the payroll should be evaluated as a $3M decision, over lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits, and other expenses. ** Failing to consider breakpoints, critical thresholds or limits Advantage of scale: In some businesses, things cascade toward the overwhelming dominance of one firm - to a winner-take-all situation. ** Failing to consider constraints - that a system's performance is constrained by its weakest link. Warren Buffett says: ""It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results."" In many business activities a few things can produce much of the value. Ask: How do we allocate our time, work, attention and money? Can we identify the few things that really matter? #### 3. Causes ** Not understanding what causes desired results. ** Believing cause resembles its effect - that a big effect must have a big or complicated cause. ** Underestimating the influence of randomness in bad or good outcomes. ** Mistaking an effect for its cause. Includes failing to consider that many effects may originate from one common root cause. ** Attributing outcome to a single cause when there are multiple causes. ** Mistaking correlation for cause. ** Failing to consider that an outcome may be consistent with alternative explanations. ** Drawing conclusions about causes from selective data. Includes identifying the wrong cause because it seems the obvious one based on a single observed effect. Also failing to consider information or evidence that is missing. There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact. Obviousness is always the enemy to correctness. ""Life is hard,"" he retorted, ""Compared to what?"" We tend to ignore alternatives, and therefore we fail to make appropriate comparisons. ** Not comparing the difference in conditions, behavior and factors between negative and positive outcomes in similar situations when explaining an outcome. #### 4. Numbers and their meaning ** Looking at isolated numbers - failing to consider relationships and magnitudes. Includes not using basic math to count and quantity. Also not differentiating between relative and absolute risk. ** Underestimating the effect of exponential growth. ** Underestimating the time value of money. #### 5. Probabilities and number of possible outcomes ** Underestimating risk exposure in situations where relative frequency (or comparable data) and/or magnitude of consequences is unknown or changing over time. ** Underestimating the number of possible outcomes for unwanted events. Includes underestimating the probability and severity of rare or extreme events. ** Overestimating the chance of rare but widely publicized and highly emotional events and underestimating the chance of common but less publicized events. Most people think dramatically, not quantitatively. ** Failing to consider both probabilities and consequences (expected value). ** Believing events where chance plays a role are self-correcting - that previous outcomes of independent events have predictive value in determining future outcomes. If we get a once in 100-year storm this year, another big one could happen next year. There is a 1% chance that the event will happen in any given year. There is no memory of the past. ** Believing one can control the outcome of events where chance is involved. People were more reluctant to give up a lottery ticket they had chosen themselves, than one selected at random for them. The lesson is, if you want to sell lottery tickets, let people choose their own numbers instead of randomly drawing them. ** Judging financial decisions by evaluating gains and losses instead of final state of wealth and personal value. ** Failing to consider the consequences of being wrong. We should never risk something we have and need for something we don't need. You only have to get rich once. The added money has no utility whatsoever. #### 6. Scenarios ** Overestimating the probability of scenarios where all of a series of steps must be achieved for a wanted outcome. Also underestimating opportunities for failure and what normally happens in similar situations. It's not that easy to make lots of money in a business in a capitalistic society. There are people that are looking at what you're doing every day and trying to figure out a way to do it better, underprice you, bring out a better product or whatever it may be. ** Underestimating the probability of systems failure - scenarios composed of many parts where system failure can happen one way or another. Includes failing to consider that time horizon changes probabilities. Also assuming independence when it is not present and/or assuming events are equally likely when they are not. ** Not adding a factor of safety for known and unknown risks. Size of factor depends on the consequences of failure, how well the risks are understood, systems characteristics and degree of control. Simplify and standardize processes, and use checklists to decrease the likelihood of operator errors. #### 7. Coincidences and miracles ** Underestimating that surprises and improbable events happen, somewhere, sometime, to someone, if they have enough opportunities (large enough size or time) to happen. The most astonishingly incredible coincidence imaginable would be the complete absence of all coincidences. ** Looking for meaning, searching for causes and making up patterns for chance events, especially events that have emotional implications. ** Failing to consider cases involving the absence of a cause or effect. We pay no attention to times when nothing happens. We shouldn't find significance in amazing past events. It's easy to be a prophet. You make twenty-five predictions and the ones that come true are the ones you talk about. Nobody keeps a record of their erroneous prophecies since they are infinite and everyday. If the opposite of a given statement is more I likely, the statement is probably false. Mysteries are not necessarily miracles. #### 8. Reliability of case evidence ** Overweighing individual case evidence and under-weighing the prior probability (probability estimate of an event before considering new evidence that might change it) considering for example, the base rate (relative frequency of an attribute or event in a representative comparison group), or evidence from many similar cases. Includes failing to consider the probability of a random matth, and the probability of a false positive and false negative. Also failing to consider a relevant comparison population that bears the characteristic we are seeking. #### 9. Misrepresentative evidence ** Failing to consider changes in factors, context or conditions when using past evidence to predict likely future outcomes. Includes not searching for explanations to why past outcome happened, what is required to make past record continue, and what forces can change it. If you could make money based on what has worked the past 20 years, all of the richest people would be librarians. The man who fed the chicken every day wrings its neck instead. The past is a good guide to the future - but not always. ** Overestimating evidence from a single case or small or unrepresentative samples. We'd rather be roughly right than precisely wrong. In other words, if something is terribly important, we'll guess at it rather than just make our judgment based on what happens to be easily countable. ** Underestimating the influence of chance in performance (success and failure). No victor believes in chance. ** Only seeing positive outcomes - paying little or no attention to negative outcomes and prior probabilities. We give too little attention to failures. ** Failing to consider variability of outcomes and their frequency. ** Failing to consider regression - in any series of events where chance is involved unique outcomes tends to regress back to the average outcome. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GUIDELINES TO BETTER THINKING - tools that provide a foundation for rational thinking ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The eternal verities: math, horse sense, fear, diagnosis of human nature, predictions regarding human behavior. Do that with discipline, its likely to work out quite well. #### 1. Models of reality Developing the habit of mastering the multiple models which underlie reality is the best thing you can do.. .It's just so much fun - and it works so well. Ask: What is the underlying big idea? Do I understand its application in practical life? Does it help me understand the world? How does it work? Why does it work? Under what conditions does it work? How reliable is it? What are its limitations? How does it relate to other models? Disney is an amazing example of autocatalysis. They had all those movies, owned the copyright. When the videocassette was invented, Disney didn't have to invent anything or do anything except take the thing out of the can and stick it on the cassette. The models that come from hard science and engineering are the most reliable. The engineering idea of a backup system, of breakpoints, of critical mass. A model should be easy to use. If it is complicated, we don't use it. It is useful on a nearly daily basis. If it is not used, we forget it We need to understand and use the big ideas from all the important disciplines - mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, psychology. If you don't have the full repertoire of models, you'll overutilize the limited repertoire you have - including use of models that are inappropriate just because they're available to you in the limited stock you have in mind. Have a full kit of tools. Go through them in your mind checklist-style. You must have he models and you must see the relatedness and the effects from the relatedness. Find connections between ideas. Derive new ideas from these connections. Combine ideas from different disciplines. The ideas of scaling from mathematics, systems and constraints from physics, and competitive advantage from microeconomics often explain how business value is created or destroyed. Find similarities or functional equivalents within or between disciplines. The functional equivalent of viscosity from chemistry is stickiness in economics. Short sentences stick in our memory. What sentence contains the most information in the fewest words? Psychology: ""We get what we reward for."" Physics: ""Energy is neither created nor destroyed - only changed from one form into another."" #### 2. Meaning Bad terminology is the enemy of good thinking. To understand meaning, ask basic questions: # Meaning of words: What do the words mean? What do they imply? Do they Anything? Can we translate words, ideas or statements into an ordinary n that tells us something? An expression is always relative. We have to 1d measure it against something. # Meaning of an event: What effect is produced? What is really happening using T words? What is it doing? What is accomplished? Under what Ins does it happen? What else does it mean? # Causes: What is happening here and why? Is this working? Why or why not? i that happen? Why does it work here but not there? How can it What are the mechanisms behind? What makes it happen? # Implications: What is the consequence of this observation, event, or :e? What does that imply? # Purpose: Why should we do that? Why do I want this to happen? # Reason: Why is this better than that? # Usefulness: What is the applicability of this? Does it mean anything in relation want to achieve? ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" - Einstein We use the risk-free rate merely to equate one item to another. In other words, we're looking for whatever is the most attractive. In order to estimate the present value of anything, we're going to use a number. And, obviously, we can always buy government bonds. Therefore, that becomes the yardstick rate to simply compare all kinds of investment opportunities across the spectrum: oil wells, farms, whatever it may be. Value is an estimate rather than a precise figure. Using precise numbers is, in fact, foolish; working with a range of possibilities is the better approach. Look at all the cash a business will produce between now and judgment day and discount it back to the present using an appropriate discount rate and buy a lot cheaper than that. Money doesn't know where it comes from. There's no sense in paying more for a glamorous business if you're getting the same amount of money. What counts in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know. We love owning common stocks - if they can be purchased at attractive prices... Unless, however, we see a very high probability of at least 10% pre-tax returns, we will sit on the sidelines. John estimates that he can take out $300,000 in cash every year. Knowing he can always buy a risk-free government bond, John uses a bond rate of 6% as the discount rate. He also knows he can reinvest whatever cash he can take out from the store at 6%. The value of the store is then $5 million ($300,000/0.06). If John's required rate of return is 10%, the value of the store is $3 million. If you can pinpoint it, you're kidding yourself. You'd be amazed at how inexact we are. The margin of safety ought to be so attractive. The decision should be obvious. If we simply don't know what's going to happen in the future, we just give up. We only buy businesses about which we're quite certain. In hiring, look for three things: intelligence, energy, and character. If they don't have the last one, the first two will kill you. When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for poor fundamental economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact. #### 3. Simplification Make fewer and better decisions. Why? Because it forces us to think more on each decision and thereby reduces our chance of mistakes. The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. Often we try to get too much information, including misinformation, or information of no use to explain or predict. We also focus on details and what's irrelevant or unknowable and overlook the obvious truths. Dealing with what's important forces us to prioritize. There are often just a few actions that produce most of what we are trying to achieve. There are huge dangers in getting too caught up in the minutiae of using a computer so that you miss the organized common sense. After 25 years, I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems. What we have learned to avoid them. In both business and investments it is usually far more profitable to simply stick with the easy and obvious than it is to resolve the difficult. A good business throws up one easy decision after another, whereas a bad one gives you horrible choices - decisions that are extremely hard to make. To do two things at once is to do neither. Decisions: Is it knowable? Is it important? ""The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill."" - Albert Einstein Start with basic questions like: What does it mean? What is the simplest example? What is the number one question? How can I tell if the answer is right? Can I come up with an example that makes it clear what the problem is? Buffett's genius was largely a genius of character - of patience, discipline and rationality. His talent sprang from his unrivaled independence of mind and ability to focus on his work and shut out the world. If you feel like you have to invest every day, you're going to make a lot of mistakes. Wait for the fat pitch. A few major opportunities, clearly recognizable as such, will usually come to one who continuously searches and waits, with a curious mind. #### 4. Rules and filters Walk away from anything I don't understand or cant quantify or doesn't work. Only deal with people I trust. Extraordinary discipline does not eliminate losses; it does prevent foolish losses. We can say no in 10 seconds to 90%+ of all things, simply because we have these filters. Evaluate new business ideas, use 4 criteria as filters: * Can I understand it? * Does it look like it has some kind of sustainable competitive advantage? * Is the management composed of able and honest people? * Is the price right? Understanding is thinking that we have a reasonable probability of being able to assess where the business will be in 10 years. If there are very important items that aren't on your checklist, you can crash. A checklist must include each critical item necessary for ""safety"" and avoiding ""accidents"" so we don't need to rely on memory for items to be checked #### 5. Goals #### 6. Alternatives Opportunity cost. Our time and money are limited. If we make a decision to do one thing we are deciding not to do some other available thing. Every minute we choose to spend on one thing is a minute unavailable to spend on other things. Every dollar we invest is a dollar unavailable for other available investments. If we decide to spend money today instead of investing for the future we give up the opportunity to spend more in the future. If I decide to play golf today I miss the opportunity to finish this book on time. Warren Buffett tells us what to look for in a spouse: ""Look for someone who will love you unconditionally and will subtly encourage you to be better than you thought you can be."" Some decisions have a greater influence on our lives. A decision that will influence our lives ten years from now is far more important than one that will influence us only today. But if we choose the wrong spouse, education, career, friends, or investment, it may haunt us a long, long time. #### 7. Consequences Whenever someone makes an assertion to you, is to always ask, ""And then what?"" Ask it about everything. Projections with the amount you'll save don't do the second step - to determine how much is going to stay home and how much is just going to flow through to the customer. The benefit of the cost reductions didn't go to the guy who bought the equipment. Some systems should be made deliberately a little unfair if they carry better consequences for us all. With the Navy Model there's no excuse. Very simply, if your ship goes aground, your career is over. It doesn't matter whether it was your fault or not. Nobody's interested in your fault. It's just a rule for the good of all, all effects considered. Civilization works better with some of these no-fault rules. Considering the net benefit, I don't care if one captain has some unfairness in his life. #### 8. Quantification How can we evaluate if a decision is intelligent or not if we can't measure it against a relevant and important yardstick? Some things can't be measured exactly, so estimating a range is the next best alternative. Everybody overweighs the stuff that can be numbered, because it yields to the statistical techniques they're taught in academia. The hard-to-measure stuff may be more important. The best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return. Be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations. Businesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don't advance smoothly (except in the offering books of investment bankers). We're suspicious of those CEOs who claim to know the future - and we become downright incredulous if they consistently reach their declared targets. Managers that always promise to ""make the numbers"" will at some point be tempted to make up the numbers. The more our calculation depends on cash flows far out in the future, the more opportunities there are for unwanted events, and the more uncertain our expected return. Whether a business sells nails or telecom equipment, if more money is going out than coming in, on a present value basis, it is worthless. Value is destroyed, not created, by any business that loses money over its lifetime, no matter how high its interim valuation may get. #### 9. Evidence Do what scientists do: Strive for objectivity. Scientists try to describe the world as it is, not as they want it to be. Science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition. The scientific process involves the following steps: - Problem or observation. Wonder what happens and why. - Find a possible solution or an explanation that can be proved or disproved by testing it against experiment and observation. - Predict consequences - see what would be implied if our guess was right. - Test - repeat the experiment against error, fraud, coincidence, and change in circumstances or environment. Report results honestly. It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. If we don't ""guess why"", there can be no experiments since a test has nothing to guide it. ""All observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any service."" - Darwin Have to have some idea of why you're looking for information. Don't just collect endless amounts of data and then only later try to make sense of it. You have to start with some ideas of reality. Look to see whether what you're seeing fits in with that basic thought structure. Mrs. B. who ran our Furniture Mart. Over a 50-year period, we'd seen her take $ 500 and turn it into a business that made $18 million pretax. So we knew she was competent. The past record is the best single guide. Then you run into the problem of the 14-year-old horse. Is there anything about the past record that makes it a poor guideline as a forecaster of the future? Instead of verifying a statement, it is sometimes better to prove it false. A single piece of evidence in favor of a statement does not prove its truth - it only supports it. But a single piece of evidence against it will show that it is false. Albert Einstein said: ""No number of experiments can prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."" Archaeology: just because something hasn't been found doesn't mean it won't be found. ""Since a lot of evidence agrees with my explanation, I must be right."" Not necessarily, the same evidence may agree with other explanations. Look for evidence that disproves your explanation. Ask: What test can disprove this? Engage in self-criticism. Question your assumptions. Explain the opposite of your beliefs. Ask: Assume I'm wrong, how will I know? Why may an opposite theory be correct? Assuming my answer is correct, what would cause me to change my mind? Then, look for that evidence. Often we don't see our weaknesses and thus are not motivated to improve. Take your initial assumption and try to disprove it. Automatic tendency in psychology called ""first-conclusion bias"". But you can train yourself away from it. #### 10. Backward thinking A lot of success comes from knowing what you really want to avoid Avoid what causes the opposite of what you want to achieve. If you want to ruin your civilization, pass laws where people can easily cheat. It's much better to let life be hard - than to create systems that are easy to cheat. Wise men profit more from fools than fools from wise men; for the wise men shun the mistakes of the fools, but fools do not imitate the successes of the wise. To reduce mistakes, we should study failures with severe consequences. Often we learn more from understanding why something doesn't work than from why it does. Ask: Why did that happen? Was was the mistake? What circumstances were present? What's the lesson? How can we create the best conditions to avoid mistakes? How can we prevent causes that can't be eliminated? How can we limit the consequences and probability? Assume we've achieved our goal, then ask: What was the purpose? Was this what I wanted? What is needed to achieve this? Then work backward to the beginning. ""We need discipline in schools."" What would be the consequences if this statement were false? Turn a statement backwards and show that the opposite is worse. What are the consequences? Unbelievable or negative? Study evidence that implies the opposite of what is normal and ask ""why."" Use ""negative"" rules - tell people what they can't do. Practice zero base thinking - start with a clean sheet of paper and ask: If we that we do, how can we best achieve our goal? #### 11. Risk We think of business risk in terms of what can happen five, 10 or 15 years from now that will destroy, modify or reduce the economic strengths we believe currently exist in the business. If we can think of very much that can go wrong, we just forget it. The best way to minimize risk is to think. I had a relative by marriage who died in his late 80s. And I don't think he ever had a loss. He only did about eight things in his lifetime. He started with a small poke, and if something wasn't a near cinch, he didn't do it. He lived well and died rich. I think it's possible for a great many people to live a life like that where there isn't much risk of disaster and where they're virtually sure to get ahead a reasonable amount. It takes a lot of judgment, a lot of discipline and an absence of hyperactivity. By this method, I think most intelligent people can take a lot of risk out of life. A single, big mistake could wipe out a long string of successes. We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks, including those never before encountered. Temperament is also important. Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term success. Ask: What is the cost of being wrong versus the benefit of being right compared to other investment opportunities? Cost: John may lose money, reputation, and experience mental stress. It will also take his focus away from other business. Benefit: Possibility to make more money over a period of time. Alternative: More time to concentrate on the present business or other opportunities. Consequences: Can I handle them? Are they reversible? In which alternative do I lose less? #### 12. Attitudes It's not that we have so little time but that we waste much of it. Life, if you know how to use it, is long. You will hear many men saying, ""When I am 50..."" - but what guarantee do you have that your life will last longer? What do we want out of life? The shorter the list, the more likely it is to focus on things that matter. Know what you understand and what you don't understand. It's not how big the circle is. But it's terribly important that you know where the perimeter is. Why should we want to play a competitive game in a field where we have no advantage - maybe a disadvantage - instead of playing in a field where we have a clear advantage? Use your advantages. Where do I have an edge over others? If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Would I be willing to see my action described by an informed and critical reporter on the front page? Act as an exemplar. Avoid controversies. Optimists live longer than pessimists. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Pick out the person you admire the most. Write the reasons why you admire him, then try to figure out why you can't have the same qualities. Find the people you don't like and figure out what you don't like about them. Ask yourself if you have some of those qualities in you. When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a total lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale. If owners behave with little regard for their business, their conduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company. The expert tends only to use models from one's own segment of a discipline, ignoring or underweighing others. Overconfident misuse. Good ideas cause more mischief than bad ideas. It is so easy to push a good idea to wretched excess. Mix in a little social proof, and brains turn to mush. Advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to some remote place, I may see Wrigley gum alongside Glotz's gum. I don't know anything about Glotz's. So if one is $0.40 and one is $0.30, am I going to take something I don't know and put it in my mouth - which is a pretty personal place - all for a lousy dime? If everybody's buying something, we think it's better. We don't like to be the one guy who's out of step. A magazine about Motorcross (for example) is a total necessity to fans of that. Its profit margins would make you salivate. Narrowcast publishing. Occasionally, scaling down and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better. In a bureaucracy, you think the work is done when it goes out of your inbox into someone else's inbox. HOW TO GET WORLDLY WISDOM: You need a latticework of mental models. Hang your actual experience and vicarious experience (books, etc) on this latticework of powerful models. With that system, things gradually fit together in a way that enhances cognition. You need the best 100 or so models from microeconomics, physiology, psychology, elementary mathematics, hard science, engineering, and so on. You don't have to be an expert in any of those. Take the really big ideas and learn them early and well. You have to learn the models so that they become part of your ever-used repertoire. 3 TIMELESS IDEAS FOR INVESTING: 1. Look at stocks as part-ownership of a business 2. Look at market fluctuations as your friend by profiting from folly rather than participating in it. 3. Margin of safety. It seems like a waste to get a PhD in Economics and have it all come back to that. There's a tendency to overlook anything that simple and important. HOW TO EVALUATE BUSINESSES: A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 1. How certain are you that there are birds in the bush? 2. When will they emerge and how many will there be? 3. What is the risk-free interest rate (yield on long-term bonds)? Answer these three questions, and you'll know the maximum value of the bush - and the maximum number of birds that should be offered for it. This applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants. Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe. If the buyer cares little about whose product or distribution services he uses, industry economics are certain to be unexciting, or even disastrous. This works with candy bars: customers buy by brand name, not by asking for a ""two-ounce candy bar"". But it doesn't work with sugar: people don't ask for ""a coffee with cream and C&H Sugar"". SIMPLICITY: I don't like difficult problems. People think that if they just hire somebody with the apppropriate labels, they can do something very difficult. That is one of the most dangerous ideas a human being can have. All kinds of things can create problems by causing complexity. At least make fewer mistakes than people who think they can do anything, no matter how complex, by just hiring somebody with a credible label. You don't have to hire out your thinking if you keep it simple. The big thing to do is avoid being wrong.

"Start Small, Stay Small",Rob Walling and Mike Taber,0615373968,6,"WHAT TO MAKE: Make sure people want what you’re building before you build it. Project/Product confusion: A project is a software application that you build as a fun side project. The end result is a neat little application that likely isn’t of use to many people. A product is a project that people will pay money for. The single most important factor to a product’s success is not the founders, not the marketing effort, and certainly not the product. It’s whether there’s a group of people willing to pay for it. The genius of niches is they are too small for large competitors, allowing a nimble entrepreneur the breathing room to focus on an under-served audience. Choose a niche market and focus so tightly that your product becomes the best in class, members of that niche will have no choice but to use your product. Building something no one wants is the most common source of failure for entrepreneurs. The best niches are under the radar, and you have to get out and do something before you will find them. As a self-funded startup you want a market that is already looking for your product, even if it doesn’t exist. This is because creating demand is very, very expensive while filling existing demand is, by comparison, cheap. A vertical market as a single industry or hobby. Examples of vertical markets include pool cleaners, dry cleaners, web designers, wine collectors and punk rock enthusiasts. IMPORTANCE: #1 = Market #2 = Marketing #3 = Aesthetic #4 = Functionality The product with a sizeable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing, a bad aesthetic, and poor functionality. In the same market, the product with better marketing wins. In the same market with equal marketing, the product with the better design aesthetic wins. Functionality, code quality, and documentation are all a distant fourth. No book, blog or conference could ever teach you more about your customers than you learn from watching them use your software. TIME MANAGEMENT: Anytime you’re on your computer ask yourself “Is this activity getting me closer to my launch date?” At this very moment am I making progress towards crossing off a to-do, -or- am I relaxing and re-energizing? If I’m doing neither, evaluate the situation and change it. Information consumption is only good when it produces something When reading blogs or books or listening to podcasts or audio books, take action notes. Define a long-term goal (launch your product), look at the next set of tasks that will get you one step closer to that goal, work, and re-evaluate in a week. The faster you fail and learn from your mistakes, the faster you will improve. Using a tool like SlimTimer, track every minute you spend working on your product, broken down into development, support and marketing. This allows you to monetize your time. OUTSOURCING: Before I start any task I ask myself: “Could one of my contractors possibly do this?” One of the biggest adjustments is accepting that time is your most precious commodity. “Dollarize”: showing your prospect how your price is less expensive than your competition due to the amount of money they will save in the long run. If you value your time at $100/hour, outsourcing work to a $6/hour virtual assistant is a no-brainer. Putting a value on your time is a foundational step in becoming an entrepreneur, and it’s one many entrepreneurs never take. Skipping this step can result in late nights performing menial tasks you should be outsourcing. LINKS: http://www.entrepreneur.com/businessideas/ Business idea search engine.

TRAFFIC / CONVERSION NUMBERS: If your price point is in the consumer range of $1 to $50 and your product is priced appropriately for your market, your conversion rate should be between 1% and 4%. If you’re priced between $50 and $1,000 or offer recurring pricing and your product is priced appropriately for your market, you’ll most likely convert between 0.5% and 2%. If your website receives 1,000 visitors per month and you have a 1% sales conversion rate you are selling 10 copies of your product each month. To increase sales by 1 copy each month (10%) you will need to do one of the following: - Generate 100 more visitors to your website - Increase your conversion rate by 0.1% Which do you think is more difficult? Answer: the first. Although common wisdom is to focus on traffic, the best internet marketers realize that increasing conversion rates for existing website visitors can yield a better return on investment. You shouldn’t plan to sell to a customer on their first visit. Your number one goal, even beyond selling your product, is turning browsers into prospects. A prospect is someone who has expressed at least a small amount of interest in your product by giving their email. For someone to provide you with their email address you must: 1. Establish Trust – you aren’t going to spam them or sell their email address 2. Establish Relevance – your product is relevant to their need and that anything you send them will be relevant 3. Establish a Reward – offer something in exchange for their email KNOWING YOUR CUSTOMER: Imagine how your ideal customer feels when they arrive at your website: What do they want to find there? What will your product provide for them that they absolutely cannot live without? What is best way to convey this message to them? What will they respond to? What elements naturally draw them in? Audio? Video? Images? What is going to make them click a link? How should you introduce your product to your customer? What should your copy say on the first page they see? What is going to convince them to provide you with their email address? What is going to convince them to purchase your product? To help understand what motivates your ideal customer, think about the following questions: What keeps your customers awake at night? What are they afraid of? What are they angry about? What are their top three daily frustrations? What do they desire most? Is there a built-in bias to the way they make decisions? (example: engineers are exceptionally analytical) Do they have their own jargon? Who else has tried to sell them something similar? How have they failed or WHAT GOES ON THE SITE: No one reads. Text is a terrible selling tool; audio, video and images are always better. The vast majority of downloadable products and SaaS applications will perform well with five core pages.

You will never come close to achieving their level of deliverability and given how hard you work to gather every email address, it is absolutely worth ensuring they all arrive at their destination. Providing ongoing content every 2-4 weeks is the best way to build a relationship. Autoresponder series: a 2-4 week gap between each email. Share relevant links with a small amount of commentary. These are the best kinds of posts – easy to write but containing a lot of value for your audience. Most audiences (software developers and web designers excluded) are out of touch with current events in their industry so it’s dead simple to provide relevant content with a few minutes of time every few weeks. Another great source of content is questions from customers or prospects. Answer the question in your email to solidify your place as an expert in this niche. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are the best days, between 7am and 10:30am. Core strategies like building an audience, search engine optimization and participating in niche communities have far more impact on your bottom line than most of the new media tools you read about MARKETING: Don’t think you’re building a brand – you’re not Coca-Cola or Johnson & Johnson. The minute those users leave your site you are out of their minds forever. Most products you launch should have their own blog, if for nothing else than to draw search engine traffic. While the worldwide podcasting and video blog watching audiences are small compared to blogs and infinitesimal compares to mailing lists, the engagement achieved from talking to your listeners is unprecedented. Blogs and mailing lists can’t touch it. The bond you are able to build with an audio or video audience is unachievable with the written word. There’s absolutely no comparison. For video blogging, I recommend the book Get Seen: Online Video Secrets to Building Your Business Google provides a Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide SEO is only two components: on-page factors and incoming links. For on-page SEO, I recommend the book Search Engine Optimization an Hour a Day DMOZ (www.dmoz.org) – Free. Still worth submitting to. You only get one crack at it, so link to your home page and choose your link text carefully. Google alerts is one of the most under-used tools in online marketing. Create an alert for all variations of your product names. For articles, 500-700 words is best. You need 500 to be over the minimum length requirements. DELEGATING / OUTSOURCING / AUTOMATING: Nearly anything I try to automate is easier to outsource first, and then automate down the line once the volume warrants it. Out of 30 tasks you might be able to outsource 6 or 8 of them tomorrow if you spend 2-3 hours today writing up the processes. Compare that with automation, which can take a week or more to get each task off your plate since it takes a lot of code to automate a task. As a startup, one of your advantages is that you move very quickly. You can roll out new features much quicker than your competition. And being able to manually process some parts of a task can often reduce your development time by 50-80% which allows you to get the feature out the door and in front of customers. If customers decide to use it, then you can automate it. If not, you can throw what little time you spent on it away. You develop the minimum required functionality to make the bare bones feature work; nothing more. You scaffold the rest with a human being; your VA. SELLING: Startups are much better bought than sold. Even if you never plan to sell your startup, you should be collecting and reviewing the data that will ultimately allow you to facilitate an easy sale. The eBay of website and software sales is Flippa Here are key metrics you should track: Traffic Stats – I recommend using Google Analytics. Revenue and Expenses – Hours Spent – Using a tool like SlimTimer, track every minute you spend working on your product, broken down into development, support and marketing. This allows you to monetize your time during month-end, I bought CMS Themer for a song (less than 2x monthly profit). The site paid itself off in net profit in 4 months. I owned it a total of 9 profitable months and sold it for a substantial gain. The reason the site had literally hundreds of interested parties when I listed it for sale was due to one reason: I had outsourced the hard part, and had tracked my time so was able to document that I had earned over $100/hour on time spent working on CMS Themer. I was selling a business, and a well paying one, rather than a job like the previous owner.",Great how-to guide about being a micropreneur: an entrepreneur running many small but profitable businesses.
Making a Good Brain Great,Daniel G. Amen,1400082099,6,"Early childhood experiences do not just create a background for development and learning, they directly affect the way the brain is wired. More people (of all ages) die from home falls than from home fires. I recommend the following cocktail for most adults: • Acetyl-L-carnitine - 500 mg once a day • Alpha-lipoic acid - 100 mg once a day • Fish oil - 1,000 mg twice a day • Phosphatidylserine - 100 mg twice a day • Super multiple vitamin with high-dose B vitamins • Vitamin E (mixed tocopherols) - 100 mg twice a day • Vitamin C - 250 mg twice a day The prefrontal cortex houses our ability to learn from mistakes, make plans, and match our behavior over time to reach our goals. When the PFC works as it should, we are thoughtful, empathic, expressive, organized, and goal-oriented. The PFC is often called the executive part of the brain, like the boss at work. When it is low in activity, it is as if the boss is gone, so there is little to no supervision and nothing gets done. When the PFC works too hard, it is as if the boss is micromanaging everyone. “He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would fully suffice.” - Albert Einstein A glass of wine once a week or once a month, but not daily - may reduce dementia by up to 70 percent. Even small amounts of daily drinking lowered overall brain size. As little caffeine as possible. Strive to eat fewer than eighteen hundred calories a day, The more fish in a person’s diet, the longer the person was able to maintain their memory. Once or twice a week is a good policy. High-quality, purified fish oil is another option. Monounsaturated fats are preferred over the polyunsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats are found in avocados, nuts (such as almonds, cashews, and pistachios), canola oil, olive oil, and peanut oil. Polyunsaturated fats are found in safflower oil, corn oil, and some fish. The polyunsaturated fats found in salmon and mackerel, and the monounsaturated fats found in canola oil and soybean oil, are high in the essential fatty acids (EFA) called omega-3 fatty acids. EFAs cannot be made by the human body and therefore must be obtained from diet (hence the name essential fatty acids). It is hard to get enough omega-3 fatty acids into our diet. Cardiovascular health is enhanced in weekly fish eaters when compared to those who ate fish only infrequently. Don’t forget: Whatever is good for your heart is also good for your brain! Good sources of vitamin C are tomatoes, fruits (especially citrus and kiwi), melon, raw cabbage, green leafy vegetables, peppers, sprouts, broccoli, and cabbage. Important sources of vitamin E are grains, nuts, milk, egg yolk, wheat germ, vegetable oils, and green leafy vegetables. Blueberries are an especially good source of antioxidants. THE BEST ANTIOXIDANT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES (ACCORDING TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE) Blueberries Blackberries Cranberries Strawberries Spinach Raspberries Brussels sprouts Plums Broccoli Beets Avocados Oranges Red grapes Red bell peppers Cherries Kiwis The book Super Foods Rx by Steven Pratt and Kathy Matthews, which lists fourteen top food groups that are healthy and reasonable in calories. Mixing colors (eating from the rainbow) is a good way to think about consuming healthy fruits and vegetables. Strive to eat red things (strawberries, raspberries, cherries, red peppers, and tomatoes), yellow things (squash, yellow peppers, small portions of bananas and peaches), blue things (blueberries), purple things (plums), orange things (oranges, tangerines, and yams), green things (peas, spinach, and broccoli), and so on. Nuts and seeds, especially walnuts. Great recipe: soak walnuts in water and sea salt overnight, drain and sprinkle with cinnamon (a natural blood sugar balancer), and low-roast four hours at 250?F - it makes them easier to digest. Doing the things you have always done is not helpful for the brain, even if those things are fairly complicated. PRACTICAL WAYS TO EXERCISE YOUR BRAIN: Dedicate yourself to new learning. Put fifteen minutes in your day into learning something new. Einstein said that if someone spent fifteen minutes a day learning something new, in a year he would be an expert. Learning to see, hear, feel, or taste subtle changes will enhance your sensory ability and stimulate brain growth. Exercise also reduces damage to neurons from toxic substances from the environment and enhances insulin’s ability to prevent high-blood-sugar levels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. Table tennis is the best brain sport ever. It is highly aerobic, uses both the upper and lower body, is great for eye-hand coordination and reflexes, and causes you to use many different areas of the brain at once as you are tracking the ball, planning shots and strategies, and figuring out spins. It is like aerobic chess. Juggling may be a particularly good exercise for the brain. Brain Gym exercises. You can learn more about this technique at braingym.com Work to enhance your cerebellum through coordination exercises. Not only will it help you think more clearly and faster, it will help improve your judgment, attention, and overall brain health. The left side is more involved with language, logic, details, and planning, while the right side is more associated with music, rhythm, creativity, social skills, and spirituality. A number of studies have found that the right hemisphere, along with the limbic system, is involved with sexual pleasure and orgasm. People are unaware that they are controlled not by events or people but by the perceptions their brain makes of them. I once heard the following story: at the turn of the last century, a shoe company sent a representative to Africa. He wired back, “I’m coming home. No one wears shoes here.” Another company sent its representative, and he sold thousands of shoes. He wired back to his company, “Business is fantastic. No one has ever heard of shoes here.” Balancing your brain through diet, exercise, music, stress reduction, and supplements will help your perceptions. Cognitive therapy (teaching people to correct negative thought patterns and to think in more rational, positive ways) enhances brain function. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (ITP), which teaches people to get along better with others by improving social support, communication, conflict resolution, and assertiveness training, to be an effective cure for depression. ITP also helps to reset brain function, enhancing prefrontal cortex activity (improving focus and judgment) and calming limbic activity (making one feel more DO NOT BELIEVE EVERY FIRST THOUGHT YOU HAVE. Since your mind takes what it sees and makes it happen, it is critical to visualize what you want and then match your behavior over time to get it. Too many people are thrown around by the whims of the day, rather than using their prefrontal cortex to plan their lives and follow through on their goals. Five primal sounds: saa, taa, naa, maa, and aa. Meditators chant each sound as they consecutively touch their thumb to fingers two, three, four, and five. The sounds and fingering are repeated for two minutes out loud, two minutes whispering, four minutes silently, two minutes whispering, and two minutes out loud. We performed SPECT scans on the participants when they were at rest one day, and then after meditation the next day. We saw marked decreases in the left parietal lobes (which showed a decreasing awareness of time and space) and significant increases in the prefrontal cortex (which showed that meditation helped to tune people in, not out). In a study of approximately 7,500 students at a university, music majors had the highest reading scores of any students on campus. Learning a musical instrument, at any age, can be helpful in developing and activating temporal lobe neurons. People with a family history of diabetes should have a fasting blood glucose test once a year after the age of forty. I take high-potency multiple vitamins every day, along with extra vitamins C and E, ginkgo biloba, alpha-lipoic acid, phosphatidal serine, acetyl-l-carnitine, CoQ10, and fish oil. After age forty, when cellular energy production and antioxidant levels in the body naturally are lower, most people will also benefit from acetyl-L-carnitine, alpha-lipoic acid, and CoQ10. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) has been reported to improve mental focus, enhance energy, and slow aging. Consider ALC if you suffer from tiredness, mental fatigue, memory loss, or attentional problems. The typical dose is 500 to 1,500 mg a day. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that increases the potency of many other antioxidants. Consider taking ALA if you are over forty and are at risk for dementia or other memory problems, cancer, or stroke. The typical dose is 100 to 200 mg a day. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), also known as ubiquinone, is a powerful antioxidant. The solubilized softgels are claimed to give higher absorption. CoQ10 is best taken with food. The typical dosage is 30 to 200 mg per day. Omega-3 fatty acids. The two most studied fish oils are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Favorite sources of fish oil supplementation. One is a supplement called Coromega, made by European Reference Botanical Laboratories; see www.coromega.com. Dr. Sears (www.drsears.com) makes a high-quality fish oil product, as do Nordic Naturals and Omega Brite. The typical dosage of fish oil is 1 to 2 g a day for prevention. Ginkoba and Ginkgold (Nature’s Way) are brands that have been compounded to reflect EGb 761. The usual effective dose is 60 to 120 mg twice a day. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a naturally occurring nutrient that is found in foods such as fish, green leafy vegetables, soy products, and rice. L-theanine is an amino acid mainly found naturally in the green tea plant. L-theanine supplements are available for the promotion of relaxation and the modulation of mood. Doses used are between 50 and 200 mg, as necessary. Take 100 percent of the B vitamins every day. Make sure you take at least 400 mcg of folate and 500 mcg of B12 a day. Vitamin C intake of 250 mg twice a day for adults. The kind of vitamin E you take matters. Mixed tocopherols, including alpha and gamma, seem to be more effective than alpha-tocopherol alone. Alpha-tocopherol is the most common form sold in stores. Because of the relatively short duration of action of the tocopherols (two to four hours), taking them twice a day gives better cellular protection",About the care of the physical brain - the goo in your skull - from a doctor who scans brains and has linked specific behavior to brain chemistry.
Business Stripped Bare,Richard Branson,1905264429,6,"Business is not about formality, or winning, or the bottom line, or profit, or trade, or commerce, or any of the things the business books tell you it's about. Business is what concerns us. If you care about something enough to do something about it, you're in business. I had never been interested in being ""in business"". I've been interested in creating things. The greatest and most unusual achievement of the Virgin Group is that it remembers what it's for. Business is creative. It's like painting. You start with a blank canvas. You can paint anything - anything - and there, right there, is your first problem. For every good painting you might turn out, there are a zillion bad paintings just aching to drip off your brush. Scared? You should be. Would I have been happy without my successes in business? I'd like to think so. But again, it depends on what you mean by business. Would I have been happy had I not found concerns to absorb me and fascinate me and engage me every minute of my life? No, absolutely not, I'd be as miserable as sin. Could it collapse overnight? Almost certainly not: we've built it to contain any amount of damage, by organising it into around 300 limited companies. I think we've proved that a branded group of separate businesses, each with limited liability for its own financial affairs, makes sense. Although the combined Virgin Group is the largest group of private companies in Europe, each individual company is generally relatively small in its sector. And so we have the advantage of being the nimble 'underdog' player in most markets. We receive hundreds of business ideas every month, often directly via our website. We employ a gatekeeper - a corporate development assistant - whose job it is to record, log and classify all ideas as they arrive. She then passes them on to our experts. They read through and research the best of them. A tiny number are passed to our investment professionals - whole teams of them. So that our own vested interests don't blind us to new opportunities, none of the committee runs a Virgin business on a day-to-day basis. They ask some very tough questions. They will rigorously push and pull your business plan about to see if there is a profitable business underneath. We look at spending plans, income forecasts, the marketing budget, and when the company is likely to break even. We work out our exit strategy - will it be a sale, or a flotation on a stock market? And, above all, we look at the key managers who will be running the business. This is the holy grail for us, because it's the people that make a great business idea work. We sign up as branded venture capitalists (occasionally, as unbranded investors), take a stake in the company, and then look for a return on that investment after about two to five years. It has been our aim to establish Virgin as the 'Most Respected Brand in the World'. It has to be one that is trusted in each and every marketplace. The first law of entrepreneurial business: there is no reverse gear. No one in business can unmake anything, any more than a band can unmake a song. It's not easy to find energetic and enthusiastic people with the right attitude. We look for people who can grow into their work, and respond with excitement when we give them greater responsibility. I have tried very hard to re-create, in every company, the atmosphere of Virgin's early years. In an ideal business environment, everybody should have a rough idea of what everyone else is going through. People should be free to talk. Banter is essential. Put people together in a way that will have them bouncing ideas off each other, befriending each other, and taking care of each other. We try as far as we can to make people feel as if they are working for their own company. Our more senior people have share stakes or options in the companies they run. Someone described Virgin as an 'unprofessional professional organisation', which for my money is just about the best backhanded compliment anyone in business could ever receive. We run our companies professionally and we make sure that everyone does their job to the highest standards. But the way we make sure is to see that people are having fun. Fun is not about acting stupid. It's the feeling you get when you're on top of things. We try to make sure that the people who come into contact with a Virgin business end up with a smile on their face (not always easy). The best Virgin manager is someone who cares about people and who is genuinely interested and wants to bring out the best in them. They will earn their colleagues' loyalty and trust, for a start. But just as important, they will make friends. A self-disciplined employee will have the patience to conduct routine business routinely, the talent to respond exceptionally to exceptional circumstances, and the wisdom to know the difference. Companies do things. They are tools designed for a particular purpose - or they should be. If they are superseded, or surplus to requirement, we shed them. We try our level best not to shed the people, or the know-how, but the company itself is not something we allow ourselves to get too nostalgic about. You learn very quickly not to skimp on the goodwill gestures. They let people know that, whatever the difficulty, you're still working for them. Young, independently minded businesses can provide customers with great service: it's the monoliths and the business establishment that make customers' lives a misery. It's about turning what excites you in life into capital, so that you can do more of it and move forward with it. I think entrepreneurship is our natural state - a big adult word that probably boils down to something much more obvious like 'playfulness'. Inspire your people to think like entrepreneurs, and whatever you do, treat them like adults. The hardest taskmaster of all is a person's own conscience, so the more responsibility you give people, the better they will work for you. The more you free your people to think for themselves, the more they can help you. You don't have to do this all on your own. We carefully research the Achilles heels of different global industries, and only when we feel we can potentially turn an industry on its head, and fulfil our key role as the consumer's champion, do we move in on it. The Virgin brand is a guarantee that you'll be treated well, that you'll get a high-quality product which won't dent your bank balance, and you'll get more fun out of your purchase than you expected - whatever it is. My driving force was finding new ways to give people a good time - ideally, in places where they were least expecting it. The Virgin brand is about irreverence and cheek. It values plain speaking. It is not miserly, or mercenary. It has a newcomer's voice - and in a world of constant technical innovation, the voice of a company that's coming fresh to things is a voice people find oddly reassuring. It's a brand that says, 'We're in this together.' We didn't need cross-holdings, or strong family structures: we had a flag. The bonding power of the Virgin brand has permitted us to take the bold decision to give everyone the opportunity to be entrepreneurs in their own right. It is a flag to which all members of our extended family pay due respect. They enjoy the advantages of doing business under the Virgin umbrella, and in return they agree to protect the integrity of the brand. If they don't, then we can legally withdraw the name. Everybody fights for their own particular Virgin company - and shares in the upside when things go well. I now have a team of people who meet once a week to go through every Virgin company, looking at figures, projections and income. They have a list of priorities, and a list of new projects. They make sure that the Virgin Group is running efficiently. This frees me up to dive in and out when necessary. Don't waste your precious time. Phone calls and emails can eat your day. Don't let them. No one will think less of you for getting to the point. Because there are so many calls to make every day, I generally keep them very brief. And a short note to somebody is often quicker than a phone call. As the business has got bigger and spread across the globe, a lot is dealt with by short notes. If you are trying to persuade someone to join you, invest with you, or make some changes, then it's important to speak to them directly and take the time so that they know what they must do. Delivery is never rocket science. When we move from sector to sector, I'd say about 90 per cent of our core delivery strategy comes with us and slots straight in, without adjustment, without fuss, without trouble. Getting to grips with an unfamiliar infrastructure is simply a question of workload - of mastering detail. What's the most critical factor in any business decision you'll ever have to make? Basically, it boils down to this question: If this all crashes, will it bring the whole house tumbling down like a pack of cards? A basic understanding of the business, gleaned by immersing yourself in every little detail for months or even weeks, is often enough to get you started. The volume of information you'll need to hack through will be high - so find some friends to help you - but the underlying business model is always fairly simple. Remember to communicate, and pay attention to detail. You wouldn't believe how far you can get, just by remembering and practising those two rules. The team had a real sense of autonomy. I didn't need to be involved day-to-day, but I was sent regular information and figures, which I looked at each night. From the off, the business acted like a listed company - and that's how all start-ups should try to behave. When you're first thinking through an idea, it's important not to get bogged down in complexity. Thinking simply and clearly is hard to do. It takes concentration and practice and self-discipline. Engage your emotions at work. Your instincts and emotions are there to help you. They are there to make things easier. For me, business is a 'gut feeling', and if it ever ceased to be so, I think I would give it up tomorrow. By 'gut feeling', I mean that I believe I've developed a natural aptitude, tempered by huge amounts of experience, that tends to point me in the right direction. My plans acquire detail as I test them against questions that on the face of it are really quite simple - and more to do with emotions than figures. If we create the best health club in town, will existing gym users go to all the bother of transferring their membership to us? Always, always, have a disaster protocol in place. It is a boss's duty to get to the scene as quickly as humanly possible. If you delay showing your face in public after a disaster, recriminations, anger and blame set in. Over the years the Virgin brand has earned the reputation of being bold and unafraid. Isn't it extraordinary how few brands communicate fearlessness? Virgin's business aim has been to find a strong position in a game-changing market. We put ourselves out there, searching for new opportunities. And we know that they are more likely to come our way if we get ahead of ourselves and prepare the ground first. Virgin's normal rate of return in business is around 30 per cent. Most really successful people I've met are more interested in doing the right and proper thing than the easy and expedient one. When we're faced with a problem, we get together promptly to look for the answer to a single question: 'Is there a way out?' And we then go right to the endgame and ask: 'What is the ideal way out of this problem for everyone?' You need to become 100 per cent focused on trying to find that way out. If it's a major problem, give it 100 per cent of your time and energy until it is sorted. Work night and day to resolve it, and try to delegate everything else that is going on. If, having done this, you fail to resolve the problem, then at least you know you've done everything in your power you can. Move on. For sole traders and very small companies, the distinction between innovation and day-to-day delivery is barely noticeable and unimportant. It's all just business, and creative, responsive, flexible business comes easier to you the smaller your operation. The secret to success in any new sector is watchfulness, usually over a period of many years. In business, as in life, you can't afford to be afraid of doing the wrong thing. Innovation is what you get when you capitalise on luck, when you get up from behind your desk and go and see where ideas and people lead you. Something that must be written into every business plan: This company will have lots and lots of parties and social get-togethers. Parties are a way of galvanising teams and allowing people to let their hair down. They have to be inclusive and encouraging, and then they are an excellent way of bringing everyone together and forging a great business culture. Once the entrepreneur has the company up and running, they often need to pass the baton on to the manager. The creator's job is to find someone with expertise who understands the vision and is prepared to follow the path. The entrepreneur's job is effectively to put themselves out of a job each time the new company is up and running. Then they can step aside and free themselves up to be entrepreneurial in a different business. It is generally asking for trouble for an entrepreneur to stick around for too long, trying to cover both roles. In a small business, you can be both the entrepreneur and the manager while you are getting it going. But you need to know and understand everything about that business. And I really mean everything. An emerging entrepreneur should sign every cheque. Examine every invoice, and you'll soon appreciate where your money is going. Even in a big business like the Virgin Group, I sit down now and again and sign every single cheque that goes out, and I ask my managing directors to do the same. For a month. Sign everything for a month every six months and suddenly you're asking: 'What on earth is this for?' You'll be able to cut out unnecessary expenditure quite dramatically when you do that. As a small-business person, you must immerse yourself 100 per cent in everything and learn about the ins and outs of every single department. As you get bigger, you will be able to delegate, and when people come to you with their problems, they'll be surprised how knowledgeable you are and how much practical advice you can offer. The reason you're knowledgeable is because in the early days of the business, you learned all about it. This is how business leadership is achieved. There are no short cuts. If you're an entrepreneur, you need to find a manager. Then you should move on, enjoy yourself and then set up your next enterprise. Nothing in business is quite like the early, frenetic days of an ambitious start-up project. There's always an amazing buzz about this kind of thing. It's high-octane and high-risk and it builds a tremendous spirit and camaraderie which takes everyone through some very trying times. I've seldom seen people work harder than in the initial stages of a new venture. Once a business matures and is established, it can become more challenging to retain that excitement. What we do at Virgin is not let businesses get too mature. If you can keep the businesses relatively small, people will know each other within the organisation and feel like part of a team. Jack Welch encouraged managers to start each day as if it was the first day in the job. He said that managers were often afraid of change - and they must embrace it. I don't think there has ever been a letter from my office which criticises the staff or an individual. Now and again I've disagreed with something and suggested changes in behaviour. But the Virgin Group has always tried to look for the best in people. That way, you get the best back. I think that you should only fire somebody as an act of last resort. If someone has broken a serious rule and damaged the brand, part company. Otherwise, stop and think. You'd be amazed how quickly people change for the better, given the right circumstances, and how willing they are to learn from costly mistakes when offered a second chance. If you've over-promoted someone and it hasn't worked out, then offer them their old job back rather than firing them. It's your fault for over-promoting them. Not theirs. Decent leadership is about explaining clearly and unemotionally why a decision has been taken. The Dalai Lama said, ""If you wish to experience peace - provide peace for another. If you wish to know that you are safe, cause others to know that they are safe. If you wish to understand seemingly incomprehensible things, help another better understand."" If you want swashbuckling action in your life, become an entrepreneur and give it a go. Learn the art of trying to set up your own business. Which is the same as saying, learn the art of making mistakes and learning lessons. ""Only a fool never changes his mind."" - Freddie Laker. We should all pledge to do nothing that we'd regret reading about in the press. What you're bad at actually doesn't interest people, and it certainly shouldn't interest you. Business will keep your mind eternally young, because business is always changing, changes always bring opportunities, and you can never hide from the changes that are round the corner. Money's only interesting for what it lets you do. If money's a poor guide to success in life, celebrity is worse. Success for me is whether you have created something that you can be really proud of.","A real and specific description of the inner workings of the Virgin companies. Every entrepreneur, investor, and manager should appreciate this detailed account of practices, philosophies and stories from the core."
Talent Is Overrated,Geoff Colvin,1591842247,6,"Bill Gates has said that if you took the twenty smartest people out of Microsoft it would be an insignificant company, and if you ask around the company what its core competency is, they don’t say anything about software. They say it’s hiring. The ability to engage in cognitively complex forms of multivariate reasoning. IQ is a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but once a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts little or nothing about performance. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt has been clear about what the company is looking for: someone who is externally focused, is a clear thinker, has imagination, is an inclusive leader, and is a confident expert. Those are behaviors, not traits. He designed his practice to work on his specific needs. Rice didn’t need to do everything well, just certain things. So he focused his practice work on exactly those requirements. By age eighteen, the violinists in the first group had accumulated 7,410 hours of lifetime practice on average, versus 5,301 hours for violinists in the second group and 3,420 hours for those in the third group. All the differences were statistically significant. “The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance” by Anders Ericsson The differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain. Deliberate practice can be applied in other domains, such as business or science, in which we almost never think about practicing. Deliberate practice is characterized by several elements, each worth examining. * - activity designed specifically to improve performance, often with a teacher’s help * - it can be repeated a lot * - feedback on results is continuously available * - it’s highly demanding mentally, or physically * - it isn’t much fun. I was designing my own practice activity, even though it’s clear that I’m completely unqualified to do so. It’s almost always necessary for a teacher to design the activity best suited to improve an individual’s performance. A business coach is looking at the same situations as a manager but can see, for example, that the manager systematically fails to communicate his intentions clearly. Without a clear, unbiased view of the subject’s performance, choosing the best practice activity will be impossible. While the best methods of development are constantly changing, they’re always built around a central principle: They’re meant to stretch the individual beyond his or her current abilities. Deliberate practice requires that one identify certain sharply defined elements of performance that need to be improved, and then work intently on them. Great performers isolate remarkably specific aspects of what they do and focus on just those things until they are improved; then it’s on to the next aspect. High repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice of a task and performing the task for real, when it counts. Steve Kerr, former chief learning officer of Goldman Sachs and a highly respected researcher on leadership development. Practicing without feedback is like bowling through a curtain that hangs down to knee level. You can work on technique all you like, but if you can’t see the effects, two things will happen: You won’t get any better, and you’ll stop caring. Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration. 4-5 hours a day seems to be the upper limit of deliberate practice, and this is frequently accomplished in sessions lasting no more than 60-90 minutes. Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands. Instead of doing what we’re good at, we insistently seek out what we’re not good at. Then we identify the painful, difficult activities that will make us better and do those things over and over. After each repetition, we force ourselves to see - or get others to tell us - exactly what still isn’t right so we can repeat the most painful and difficult parts of what we’ve just done. When we see great performers doing what they do, it strikes us that they’ve practiced for so long, and done it so many times, they can just do it automatically. But in fact, what they have achieved is the ability to avoid doing it automatically. Great performers never allow themselves to reach the automatic, arrested-development stage in their chosen field. That is the effect of continual deliberate practice - avoiding automaticity. The essence of practice, which is constantly trying to do the things one cannot do comfortably, makes automatic behavior impossible. Everyone in these studies is hearing the same things, but through years of practice, some are perceiving more. The relevance of these findings for business seems obvious. Specifically, we can abstract from the research a few ways, directly applicable in business, that top performers perceive more. They understand the significance of indicators that average performers don’t even notice. Sam Walton found an innovative way to gauge customer satisfaction. He realized that the best indicator of how happy his customers were was to measure how happy his employees were; the way managers treated the employees was the way employees would treat the customers. Laura Rittenhouse, an unusual type of financial analyst, counts the number of times the word I occurs in annual letters to shareholders from corporate CEOs, contending that this and other evidence in the letters helps predict company performance (basic finding: Egomaniacs are bad news). Much of the power of looking further ahead comes from the simple act of raising one’s gaze and getting a new perspective, and doing it not once or occasionally, but using practice principles to do it often and get better at it. When was the last time you, in your working role, participated in a deep discussion about the state of your business five years from now? How about fifteen years from now, including a look at the future of your business’s environment, competitors, regulators, and other factors? Such discussions rarely happen below the level of the CEO, yet the experience of excellent performers suggests they offer advantages for everyone. There are plenty of companies, many of them in biotechnology or infotech, with no profits and no prospect of profits anytime soon, yet with considerable share prices. Investors are valuing these companies by looking years into the future. The future always counts, and looking further into it - rationally - is always an advantage. It’s a matter of seeing black versus seeing five shades of black, and it works in evaluating people, situations, proposals, performances, products, or anything else. In each case, seeing differences that others don’t see is another way of perceiving more. Comparing world-class players with good club-level players. What made them better? They had more knowledge about their field. Many companies work hard to give their top performers the widest possible knowledge by assigning them to many jobs that are different in nature and location - operating jobs, staff jobs, all around the world - and in this way the top performers have typically learned several, and sometimes all, of the most important parts of the business. Endurance runners have larger than average hearts, an attribute that most of us see as one of the natural advantages with which they were blessed. But no, research has shown that their hearts grow after years of intensive training; when they stop training, their hearts revert toward normal size. Because the demands of achieving exceptional performance are so great over so many years, no one has a prayer of meeting them without utter commitment. You’ve got to know what you want to do, not suspect it or be inclined toward it or be thinking about it. Experienced masters in our field who can advise us on the skills and abilities we need to acquire next, and can give us feedback on how we’re doing. Benjamin Franklin: He found examples of prose clearly superior to anything he could produce. Making brief notes on the meaning of each sentence: a few days later he would take up the notes and try to express the meaning of each sentence in his own words. When done, he compared his essay with the original, “discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.” Franklin realized also that a key element of a good essay is its organization, so he developed a method to work on that. He would again make short notes on each sentence in an essay, but would write each note on a separate slip of paper. He would then mix up the notes and set them aside for weeks, until he had forgotten the essay. At that point he would try to put the notes in their correct order, attempt to write the essay, and then compare it with the original; again, he “discovered many faults and amended them.” Franklin identified the aspects of his performance that needed to be improved and found a way to stretch himself, the essential core of deliberate practice. Significantly, he did not try to become a better essay writer by sitting down and writing essays. Instead, like a top-ranked athlete or musician, he worked over and over on those specific aspects that needed improvement. For spoken presentations: Watch a presentation that you consider especially well done and make notes of its various points; later, after you’ve forgotten most of it, use your notes to create a talk making the same points; deliver the talk and record it; then compare your video with the original. Chess: Study a particular position and choose the move you would make, then compare it with the move chosen by the master; if they’re different, figure out why and which is better. The chess model has been used widely in business education: the case method. Pioneered at the Harvard Business School, it is strongly analogous to chess practice: You’re presented with a problem, and your job is to figure out a solution. Real life being the way it is, you often won’t know whether the solution chosen by the case’s protagonist was the best one possible, or whether yours was any better. But the process of focusing on the problem and evaluating proposed solutions is powerfully instructive. Cases: students at the Harvard Business School study more than five hundred of them during the two-year program. Conditioning can also be practiced with new material. Analyze the basic ratios in an unfamiliar financial statement with pen and paper, even though you have software that could do it all with one click. Do a value-based analysis of a stock. Pencil-edit a magazine article. You won’t be learning new skills; you’ll be building the strengths that make all your skills possible. Practice by yourself through the fast-growing world of business simulations. It’s quite amazing what’s available. Web-based or downloadable simulation games in marketing, stock trading, negotiating, corporate strategizing, and many other disciplines at several levels of sophistication are widely available. The best performers set goals that are not about the outcome but about the process of reaching the outcome. The best performers make the most specific, technique-oriented plans. They’re thinking of exactly, not vaguely, how to get to where they’re going. When a customer raises a completely unexpected problem in a deal negotiation, an excellent businessperson can pause mentally and observe his or her own mental processes as if from outside: Have I fully understood what’s really behind this objection? Am I angry? Am I being hijacked by my emotions? Do I need a different strategy here? What should it be? Choose a comparison that stretches you just beyond your current limits. Research confirms what common sense tells us, that too high a standard is discouraging and not very instructive, while too low a standard produces no advancement. Make domain knowledge a direct objective rather than a byproduct of work. Set a goal of becoming an expert on your business. If you know too much about a situation, a business, a field of study, then you can’t have the flash of insight that is available only to someone unburdened by a lifetime of immersion in the domain. Too much experience within a field may restrict creativity because you know so well how things should be done that you are unable to escape to come up with new ideas. High creative achievement and intrinsic motivation go together. Creative people are focused on the task (How can I solve this problem?) and not on themselves (What will solving this problem do for me?).","Talent is not innate - it comes from thousands of hours of deliberate practice: focused improving of your shortcomings. That's it. If you can get past the first 20% of the book that just asks questions, the next 60% is quite good."
Overachievement,John Eliot,1591841313,6,"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. All progress depends on the unreasonable man. Great performers are, by definition, abnormal; they strive throughout their entire careers to separate themselves from the pack. What this means is that traditional “health” psychology has actually been pushing performers in the wrong direction! To be a top performer you have to be passionately committed to what you’re doing and insanely confident about your ability to pull it off, Thinking is a habit, and like any other habit, it can be changed; it just takes effort and repetition. How do they not think about all the distractions and possible outcomes and the details of a given performance when they’re under the gun? The best in every business do what they have learned to do without questioning their abilities—they flat out trust their skills, which is why we call this high-performance state of mind the “Trusting Mindset.” Routine access to the Trusting Mindset is what separates great performers from the rest You cannot pull up all those years of education, training, and experience in your memory as you perform—that’s the “Training” Mindset. In the Trusting Mindset, you have to let all that expertise be there instinctively. Different, in fact, as you and a squirrel running across a telephone wire! Squirrels cannot think. This ability to reason, evaluate, and make rational calculations is what separates us from other animals, and surely such rationality is a blessing in life—except when you are performing under pressure. Then you want to put aside the Training Mindset and respond to the stimuli bombarding you as much like a squirrel as is humanly possible. Squirrels are natural masters of the Trusting Mindset. I want to help you find your inner squirrel. We humans can assure a similar kind of closed processing by taking our cerebral cortex out of the game, as it were, and allowing ourselves to react to sensory stimuli with motor responses we have already stored. Tossing a set of keys seems to require no thought; it’s very squirrel-like. The consequences are minimal, so we don’t bother to use our cerebral cortex. Chest-high—this time for a $1 million prize to the most accurate tosser—enter open loop processing. Things would likely turn scientific; people would start practicing. What was a simple, “minimal synaptic” task, not to mention a fun game, is now difficult and filled with potential for anxiety. Once the pressure is on, people try to toss a set of keys across a room and end up choking. That instinctive, free-wheeling, “What’s the big deal?” trusting attitude has been replaced by an analytical, critical, evaluative, “there’s a fortune hanging on this toss so I better make sure I’ve got it right” training approach to performance. Performance is simply “child’s play,” which suggests a useful definition of the superstar’s edge: The Trusting Mindset is what you were in before you knew any better. Former college football coach and NFL Super Bowl champion Jimmy Johnson used to help his players play with more abandon, and which I now use in my class: Put a two-by-four board on the floor and walk from one end to the other. It is not hard. Not one of my students has ever fallen off the board. If you videotape yourself doing this exercise, you will see that your foot hits the middle of the board every step of the way, as if you were walking down the street. Your eyes just look past the board at the far end, to where you’re going, and your feet just move. Now suspend that board thirty feet in the air and walk from one end to the other. This, I believe, illustrates the feeling that accompanies the Trusting Mindset perfectly. A tightrope walker is in a Trusting Mindset in an environment where everything screams: “Watch out! The difference between circus performers and the rest of us is that they have trained themselves to perform just like squirrels and step onto a sky-high, swaying wire, effortlessly and simply, as if out on an afternoon stroll. They’ve purposefully devoted so much time to practicing thinking that way that they can switch it on at will. And so do the best entrepreneurs, surgeons, diplomats, politicians, and other best-in-the-business performers. Success depends on emptying your head rather than filling it. Pressure occurs at the moments when meaningful accomplishment is possible. In fact, that is the reason why performers perform: for the opportunity to tackle challenges head on, to do something significant, to demonstrate what their talent and hard work can produce. Those who perform well consistently—the superstars—are always looking for the opportunity to take their game to the next level. The heart beats faster to get more blood through the arteries, carrying nutrients and oxygen to the working muscles and brain cells so they can perform at a higher level. The physical symptoms of fight-or-flight are what the human body has learned over thousands of years to operate more efficiently and at the highest level. In our culture few words carry a more negative connotation than “pressure” and “stress.” Stress gets blamed for everything that doesn’t have an otherwise clear diagnosis. Going gray or losing your hair? Must be stress. Unidentified pains or headaches? You guessed it. But stress is not the cause; it’s how you interpret stress that causes psychosomatic illness. If you have to address an audience, even a tiny one, you had better rehearse in front of some kind of audience. once you start enjoying that kind of pressure, I advise you to ratchet things up a notch. Incorporate some distractions in your rehearsal. Encourage audience members to heckle you or ask the toughest questions they can think of. “If the world were perfect, it wouldn’t be.” Ninety percent of this game is half mental. Great performers in all fields seem immune to what outsiders think about them. Their sense of themselves never depends on the feedback—positive or negative—they get from their environment. They know that the world tilts toward the conventional, Super salesmen or sport phenoms, they started out inclined to believe that they would excel long before the evidence was in (or, in some cases, even before they chose a career). Identify a thinking pattern that we want to use under pressure and then practice it, over and over. Choose a new lens through which to see reality and start using it the majority of the time. Only people who take the time to get to know the intangibles about you are worth using as resources. A personal coach who helps us work through certain problems, has suggestions for appropriate fixes, but never tries to limit anyone. These kinds of experts teach you what they have learned from experience, particularly from dealing with other performers with problems like yours. But if you walked into my office today for a consultation, I would also want to know immediately: Do you have an exciting, vivid vision of the world and where you are in it? Are you extremely committed to the success of that vision? Are you so confident about your potential that other people will think you’re a little too cocky for your own good, maybe even out of your mind? Talking about dreams may be the last taboo. Vaughn Walwyn A dream is a feeling that sticks. A dream is a feeling that sticks—and propels. One reason why movies pull us into their world so easily—why they’re so psychologically captivating—is that they skip the minutiae of daily life, only stopping to feature its dramas. You are not likely to see Julia Roberts getting in the shower three times to tackle a bad hair day or Tom Cruise brushing his teeth before the start of a big action sequence. Goal setting will focus your life more on the details. Dream setting will help you stay focused on the drama. Chasing dreams is a wide-open process; it’s about allowing yourself a broad path to success, finding adventure, opening new doors. Classic Trusting Mindset. When you have nothing to do, where does your mind wander? Chances are that’s where your dream lies. Back in the early 1970s, sociologist Darrel Siedentop, now the dean of the College of Education at Ohio State University, was conducting research on human development in sport. In his free time, he was a passionate gardener who had landscaped his large backyard beautifully with a well-mowed lawn surrounding his pride and joy, a lovely flower garden. One afternoon, he came home from work, headed for the garden, and was appalled at what he saw. Someone had been tramping through his flower beds. Staking out the scene of the crime the next day, he heard some voices in the yard, and there were his culprits: neighborhood kids who were using his yard as their after-school football field, diving for touchdown catches into his soft flower beds. Siedentop was furious. But he also was an accomplished scholar who studied social motivation. He had an idea. He emerged from the house and called the kids over. Instead of threatening them, as they expected, or punishing them (or worse, calling their parents), he informed the football players that he was delighted that they loved his flower garden as much as he did. He invited them to keep coming over after school, and to encourage them, he offered to pay them a dollar apiece to play in his backyard. The kids could not believe their good luck. Not only could they continue their football games in this great field, but they would also get paid for it, just like professional athletes! After school the very next day, they met in the sociologist’s yard to play, and, sure enough, he paid them each a dollar. Every day, they showed up and collected their fee. Within a couple of weeks, however, they came less and less, and soon stopped showing up altogether. Siedentop not only had his garden back, he also had data for the motivation chapter in his landmark 1972 book Development and Control of Behavior in Sport and Physical Education. The story of his “accidental” study is a staple today in psychology and sociology classrooms around the globe for explaining the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The neighborhood kids, Professor Siedentop wrote, initially used his flower bed for their end zone because it was fun. They loved playing football, his plush green yard provided the neighborhood’s most inviting field, and diving for catches into a soft flower bed had the extra kick of seeming like they were scoring in the colorfully painted end zones of the Rose Bowl. But when he started paying the kids, he began to change their motivation. Soon they were coming to his yard not for the joy of a pickup game of football, but to make a buck. Their motivation had been shifted from internal—“Hey, let’s play”—to external—“That weird guy will give us a dollar again.” Siedentop’s conclusion: Commitment that is personally driven is stronger and more enduring than commitment hinging upon outside rewards. It’s comparable to playing the violin because you love the sound and rhythm and feel as opposed to your mother loving the idea that you’re playing the violin. “But you are musically gifted!” your mother might protest. And you actually might be extremely talented. But you will never turn into a great musician because, as the old saying goes, “your heart isn’t in it.” How differently great performers think. They decide what they want out of life and work and commit to that choice with the single-minded focus we usually identify only with starving artists “To be a leader, you have to make people follow you, and nobody wants to follow someone who does not know where he is going.” Soon after Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived in the United States in 1968, he made a prediction: He would become a movie star, make millions, marry a glamorous woman, and wield political power. Confidence is different from “false confidence.” Confidence needs to be based on tangible facts and solutions, inner talent, things you can build upon, potential, actions you can take, directions in which you are determined to head. When conditions are that bad, the only way to make it through is to focus intently on what you have to do in the immediacy of this very second. Great players don’t think in terms of probability; they think in terms of possibility. Segmenting your work is an effective way to narrow your concentration you must think about what you have to do right now, immediately, to take the next step I actually have recommended to some clients to create even more chaos at work so that getting any work done at all will force them to be in the present. Simplify and narrow what you think about: Just go out target shooting. Once you’ve selected a focused, research-backed target, execute it single-mindedly and without reservation. If you start second-guessing your strategy and switch to another in the middle of the sale, you will have taken your mind’s eye off the target. Such doubt (and the subsequent loss of concentration) is more likely to cost you the sale than a bad strategy is. When expert putters miss, they don’t say, “I am a terrible putter.” They say, “I picked the wrong target.” Whatever your line of work, there’s a key element of what you’re doing that can soak up all your attention. “When a man knows he’s going to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.” Close your eyes and don’t think of a tall giraffe. What occupied your mind’s eye? Yup, a tall giraffe! The solution is not to remove a thought, image, or feeling from your brain, but to summon up a new one to replace it. The more you absorb your thinking in an alternative target, the more the unpleasant or performance-hampering information gets pushed out, without your having to think about it. Preperformance routines should be designed to get you to think clearly and simply during an upcoming event—to be confident, to focus, to take advantage of the physical response a pressure situation sparks. That little routine is a tool for making the transition between training and trusting—two opposing mindsets. He’d stop and intentionally commit himself to only what he was doing at present. It wasn’t so much of a warm-up or stretching routine, but a mental check to get himself away from the multitasker’s mindset. In those days, the Dave Matthews To maximize your potential in whatever you might do for a living, you need to get into that mental state in which your focus is most intense, in which you trust your abilities, experience, and the work you’ve already done. The purpose of any routine is to help you make that all-important transition between preparing to perform and actually performing. I will end up on top, eventually. No matter what you are doing, there is a fun way to do it. “Is there a disconnect between what I say my philosophy is and the thoughts I entertain all day long, particularly what I focus on in the face of adversity?” If I asked you to write down your thinking cornerstones, would you proceed to file the paper or note card in safe storage, or would you tack it up on your bathroom mirror or computer monitor and thoughtfully digest it every day? A philosophy is only as good as how much you exercise it. Level with yourself about your bad habits of thinking and start developing their converse. “I’m prepared for the worst”? In business, being “creative” is likely to mean cheating, as in “creative bookkeeping.” The Ability to “Mess Around” One of the first things I advise my clients to do is to spend more time “messing around.” Discover the fun of engaging themselves in a difficult task and trying to figure it out, trying to innovate. I want them to forget about the results, whether the outcome is successful or not. You are unlikely to get better at what you do without pushing yourself, without taking some risks, and without making a lot of mistakes.","Performance coach, with a bent towards sports, surgery, and executive performance, gives his thoughts on being a top performer. The key is the ""Trusting Mindset"": like a squirrel runs across a telephone wire. Just doing it, without thought, because you've trained yourself plenty until that point."
The How of Happiness,Sonja Lyubomirsky,159420148X,6,"What are the meanings and mysteries of happiness? Is it possible to acquire more of it, and can new happiness ever endure? These are foundational questions to which I have devoted my entire career as a research psychologist. Taught a single happiness-enhancing strategy to a group of severely depressed people - those whose depression scores put them in the most extremely depressed category. Although these individuals had great difficulty even leaving their beds, they were instructed to log on to a web site and engage in a simple exercise. The exercise involved recalling and writing down three good things that happened every day - for example, “Rosalind called to say hello,” “I read a chapter of a book my therapist recommended,” and “The sun finally came out today.” Within fifteen days their depressions lifted from “severely depressed” to “mildly to moderately depressed,” and 94 percent of them experienced relief. We have been conditioned to believe that the wrong things will make us lastingly happy. Psychological scientists have amassed persuasive evidence that we are routinely off base about what will bring us pleasure and fulfillment, and as a result, we sometimes work to make things happen that don’t actually make us happy. The thinking and behavior patterns of the happiest participants in our studies: They devote a great amount of time to their family and friends, nurturing and enjoying those relationships. They are comfortable expressing gratitude for all they have. They are often the first to offer helping hands to coworkers and passersby. They practice optimism when imagining their futures. They savor life’s pleasures and try to live in the present moment. They make physical exercise a weekly and even daily habit. They are deeply committed to lifelong goals and ambitions (e.g., fighting fraud, building cabinets, or teaching their children their deeply held values). Last but not least, the happiest people do have their share of stresses, crises, and even tragedies. They may become just as distressed and emotional in such circumstances as you or I, but their secret weapon is the poise and strength they show in coping in the face of challenge. I use the term happiness to refer to the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile. MYTH: HAPPINESS LIES IN CHANGING OUR CIRCUMSTANCES “I would be happy IF ______” or “I will be happy WHEN ______.” Changes in our circumstances, no matter how positive and stunning, actually have little bearing on our well-being. One-third of all homes in 1940 did not have running water, indoor toilets, or bathtub/showers, and more than half had no central heating. Frank Lloyd Wright observed: “Many wealthy people are little more than the janitors of their possessions.” Not only does materialism not bring happiness, but it’s been shown to be a strong predictor of unhappiness. Married people are significantly happier than their single peers. The only exception that I would argue is the effects of having children. As a mother of two I can attest that the first time you cuddle with your child, it feels wonderful. The thousandth time, it feels - oh, maybe 95 percent as wonderful. If you’re unhappy with your job, your friends, your marriage, your salary, or your looks, the first step you should take toward reaching greater lasting happiness is to put those things aside in your mind for now. Hard as it is, try not to reflect on them. Keep reminding yourself that these things are really not what is preventing you from getting happier. Whether or not your fraternal twin (or any other sibling) is happy or unhappy implies nothing about how happy or unhappy you might be. This fact - that identical twins (but not fraternal ones) share similar happiness levels - suggests that happiness is largely genetically determined. Two men - both named James - who encountered each other for the first time at age thirty-nine. The day they met, both were six feet tall and weighed exactly 180 pounds. Each smoked Salems, drank Miller Lite, and habitually bit his fingernails. When they discussed their life histories, some incredible coincidences emerged. Both had married women named Linda, had divorced them, and then remarried women named Betty. Each James enjoyed leaving love notes to his wife throughout the house. Their firstborn sons were also named James, one James Alan and the other James Allen, and both men had named their dogs Toy. Each James had owned a light blue Chevrolet and had driven it to the same beach in Florida (Passa-Grille Beach) for family vacations. PKU is said to have a heritability of 1, because it is entirely genetically determined. But this doesn’t mean that an infant born with the gene that causes PKU is doomed to its lethal effects. If the parents ensure that the infant’s diet is free of an amino acid called phenylalanine, which is found in such common foods as eggs, milk, bananas, and NutraSweet, the brain damage may be entirely prevented. The more stress and trauma the New Zealanders had experienced during their last five years, the more likely they were to become depressed. The critical finding, however, was that the stressful experiences led to depression only among those participants who carried the “bad” short allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene. Interestingly, the same result was found for stress suffered in childhood. Those participants who were maltreated between ages three and eleven were more likely to become depressed at age twenty-six, but again, only if they carried the ill-fated short allele. If the New Zealanders with the short “bad” allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene were able to avoid highly stressful situations or to engage psychotherapists or supportive confidants when they anticipated stress, their genetic propensity for depression might never be triggered. Furthermore, new research has shown that individuals unfortunate enough to possess the “bad” gene yet fortunate to have had either supportive family environments or several present-day positive life experiences do not become depressed.57 In order to express or not to express themselves, genes need a particular environment (e.g., a happy marriage or job layoff ) or a particular behavior (e.g., seeking out social support). This means that no matter what your genetic predisposition, whether or not that predisposition is expressed is in your hands. The Serenity Prayer, written by German philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr and widely adopted for use in twelve-step programs: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” Contrary to popular belief, people actually get happier with age. If we observe genuinely happy people, we shall find that they do not just sit around being contented. They make things happen. They pursue new understandings, seek new achievements, and control their thoughts and feelings. Studied 1,761 people over the course of fifteen years, starting when they were single, then continuing after they became married and stayed married. On average, as this remarkable study found, people were no happier during the years after marriage than before marriage, and the average “marriage boost” in happiness lasted for only two years. Markus didn’t want the effects of marriage to “wear off”; he didn’t want to adapt to the rewards of marriage and take it for granted. So he decided to dedicate himself to be the best husband he could be and not take his wife and their relationship for granted. He consciously remembers to say, “I love you,” to bring her flowers, to initiate plans, trips, and hobbies, to take an interest in his wife’s challenges, successes, and feelings. All of us have unique needs, interests, values, resources, and inclinations that undoubtedly predispose us to put effort into and benefit from some strategies more than others. For example, an extravert may be more likely to stick with an activity that brings her into regular contact with other people, and a very nurturing person may benefit more from an activity that grants him opportunities to take care of others. Furthermore, some people are best served by working on an area of specific weakness (whether it’s pessimism or overthinking or problems with friendship), and others profit from engaging in a happiness strategy that meshes with their personal ideal of happiness (be it positive thinking or gratifying relationships or fulfilling work). If there’s any “secret” to becoming happier, the secret is in establishing which happiness strategies suit you best. Once you have done so, half the battle is won; the way to greater happiness is in your hands. “Happy people are all alike; every unhappy person is unhappy in his or her own way.” A particular happiness-increasing strategy will match you better if it feels natural to you and you are truly motivated to pursue it - that is, you want to do it because you value doing it and because you find it enjoyable and not because you feel forced or pressured into doing it, out of either guilt or a desire to please. Gratitude: “a felt sense of wonder, thankfulness, and appreciation for life.” This effect was observed only for those who expressed gratitude every Sunday night. The participants who counted their blessings three times a week didn’t obtain any benefit from it. This finding might seem puzzling at first, but we believe there is an explanation: The average person made to express his or her gratitude every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday appeared to have become bored with the practice, perhaps finding it a chore, whereas the person made to express gratitude only once a week likely continued to find it fresh and meaningful over time. Grateful people are more likely to help others (e.g., you become aware of kind and caring acts and feel compelled to reciprocate) and less likely to be materialistic (e.g., you appreciate what you have and become less fixated on acquiring more stuff People who feel gratitude toward particular individuals (even when they never directly express it) experience closer and “higher-quality” relationships with them. When you become truly aware of the value of your friends and family members, you are likely to treat them better, perhaps producing an “upward spiral”. ""Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson Susan Nolen-Hoeksema has spent two decades investigating this phenomenon, which she calls overthinking, exactly what it is. Overthinking is thinking too much, needlessly, passively, endlessly, and excessively pondering the meanings, causes, and consequences of your character, your feelings, and your problems: Although people have a strong sense that they are gaining insight into themselves and their problems during their ruminations, this is rarely the case. What they do gain is a distorted, pessimistic perspective on their lives. Truly happy people have the capacity to distract and absorb themselves in activities that divert their energies and attention away from dark or anxious ruminations. “Upward” comparisons (e.g., “He’s paid a higher salary,” “She’s thinner”) may lead to feelings of inferiority, distress, and loss of self-esteem, versus “downward” comparisons (e.g., “He got laid off,” “Her cancer’s spread”) The happiest people take pleasure in other people’s successes and show concern in the face of others’ failures. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote: “Compassion is the basis of all morality.” “True happiness consists in making others happy,” according to a Hindu proverb. Only those who did it once a week (versus three times a week) were rewarded with an increase in well-being. Doing acts of kindness on a regular basis makes people happy for an extended period. But the extent to which people vary what they do makes an enormous difference. Indeed, those participants who had to repeat their three kind acts over and over again actually dropped in happiness by the middle of the study before bouncing back to their original levels. These individuals probably found their exercise to be just another item on their to-do list - that is, a tedious experience that detracts rather than adds to happiness. If an activity is meant to enhance well-being, it needs to remain fresh and meaningful. Helping others makes you feel advantaged (and thankful) by comparison Follow the model of the one group in my first kindness intervention that was rewarded with the biggest increases in happiness - namely, pick one day per week (say, a Monday), and on that day (and on no others) commit one new and special large act of kindness Certain categories of helping behavior are actually detrimental to physical and mental health. The one researchers know the most about is full-time caregiving for a chronically ill or disabled loved one. Studies show, for instance, that caregivers of spouses with Alzheimer’s disease show depression levels three times greater than the average person. Social support. One of the most important functions of a social bond is the provision of social support in times of stress, distress, and trauma. I know firsthand (and the research confirms) that there may be no better coping mechanism than confiding or sharing a problem with a friend or intimate. Social support can be tangible (e.g., driving us to the hospital), emotional (e.g., listening, reassuring, and helping us generate solutions or alternate perspectives on problems), and informational (e.g., providing financial advice). Indeed, people with strong social support are healthier and live longer. It is within interpersonal relationships that most of us experience for the first time the emotion of love - the most wildly happiness-inducing emotion there is - and find meaning and purpose in our lives. Of course, as everybody knows, love has its ups and downs; nonetheless, most identify it as one of the chief things that makes them happy. But what about our friendships, family, and intimate relationships? Do we adapt to them as easily and quickly as we adapt to material goods? The answer turns out to be no. One economist has shown, for example, that people’s desires for happy marriages, for children, and for “quality” children do not change as they successfully attain those things. In other words, there is something special and unique about relationships, and we would do well to strengthen, nourish, and enjoy them. Pick one strategy from the array below, and start doing it today. John Gottman is a marriage researcher who has psychologically dissected hundreds of married couples. His book The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work is, in my opinion, the best marital advice manual on the market by far. What are the secrets of the successful marriages? The first is that the partners talk a lot. The successful couples spend five hours more per week being together and talking. In the most flourishing relationships partners evoke the best in each other, helping them come closer in reaching their ideal selves. This has been termed the Michelangelo effect. Just as Michelangelo unearthed an ideal form by sculpting a block of marble, so romantic partners can support and facilitate each other to do the same. Because satisfied and stable couples are relatively more likely to idealize each other, they may be more likely to reinforce each other’s positively biased perceptions, helping make them come true. One couple told me that the secret of their relationship - she’s an intelligent, sweet-tempered former model, and he’s an outgoing, funny, self-described geeky journalist - is that each of them thinks he or she has the better deal. A deep sense of shared rituals, dreams, and goals underlies thriving relationships. These all are elements that connect you to each other and create a singular inner life shared by just the two of you. You grow together, explore new directions and take risks together, challenge your assumptions together, and take responsibility together. Every week try to do at least one thing that supports your partner’s roles (e.g., as parent, skier, manager, chef ) and dreams (to travel abroad, to climb the corporate ladder, to go back to school, and so on). The goal should be to honor and respect each other and each other’s life dreams and interests, even if you don’t share them all. Relative to married people, singles are closer to their friends and have more frequent contact with them and that lifelong single older women tend to have close to a dozen devoted decades-long friends. Friendships don’t just happen; they are made. One prominent psychologist suggests that the magic number is to have three friends or companions you can really count on. Make time (again). Show interest in other people and offer them encouragement. Once a friendship forms, create rituals that allow you to get together and be in touch on a regular basis - a weekly date to go to the gym, a book club, a monthly dinner out, a joint vacation, or a daily e-mail. In this way, friends become as much a priority as all the other areas of your life. Listen to your friends’ disclosures and problems: Make eye contact, give your full attention, and acknowledge his or her statements. Hold off giving unsolicited advice or turning attention back to yourself by recounting your own story. Be supportive and loyal. Be helpful and supportive when your friends need it, and affirm their successes. As I mentioned earlier, we often feel threatened by our friends’ triumphs. Instead of feeling envious, try to bask in their reflected glory. Other universal rules of friendship include standing up for your friends when they’re not there, keeping secrets, not putting down their other friends, and reciprocating favors. How, then, do you know if you’ve forgiven someone? It’s when you have experienced a shift in thinking, such that your desire to harm that person has decreased and your desire to do him good (or to benefit your relationship) has increased. Consider how much you agree with the following statements, borrowed from a forgiveness scale: I’ll make him/her pay. I want to see him/her hurt and miserable. I live as if he/she doesn’t exist, isn’t around. I keep as much distance between us as possible. Forgiving is something that you do for yourself and not for the person who has wronged you. Forgiving does not mean that you should necessarily restore the relationship with the transgressor, nor does it mean excusing or condoning. Some acts may indeed be inexcusable. Buddha said, “Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one getting burned.” Appreciate being forgiven. Before you are able to forgive another person, a good first exercise is to appreciate an instance of when you yourself have been forgiven. Another way to appreciate being forgiven is to seek forgiveness for yourself. Whether it’s for a past or present wrong, write a letter of apology. Recognizing and accepting that sometimes you are the transgressor may give you empathy and insight into people who are the transgressors in your own life. One way to practice empathy in your daily life is to notice every time someone does something that you do not understand. Try to work out such a person’s thoughts, feelings, and intentions. Why did he behave the way he did? What factors might explain it? If possible, ask him yourself and (assuming that he is self-insightful), you might learn something. Flow is a state of intense absorption and involvement with the present moment. You’re totally immersed in what you’re doing, fully concentrating, and unaware of yourself. The activity you’re performing is challenging and engrossing, stretching your skills and expertise. To maintain flow, we continually have to test ourselves in ever more challenging activities. We have to apply focused mental discipline or strenuous physical exertion. We have to stretch our skills or find novel opportunities to use them. Give yourself the goal of learning more about the speaker. What is on her mind? What emotions is she experiencing right now? Have you learned something about her that you didn’t know? Savoring album is essentially a strategy to create and savor the memories (the mental photographs) of your positive experiences. It’s also valuable to review the album in less happy times, when you’re especially needful of a boost. Train yourself to use a camera as a savoring tool. Foster savoring in the laboratory by drawing people’s attention to the bittersweet or transient nature of some positive life experiences - that is, by pointing out that many such experiences will eventually end. The bittersweet (“graduation is soon”) group was more likely to show increases in happiness and to engage in savoring behaviors (e.g., spending time with friends, taking photos, participating in college clubs, or taking a scenic route to class). Nostalgia is memory with the pain removed. Happiness Activity No. 10: Committing to Your Goals An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding. - Robert Louis Stevenson Weighed down by the sorrows and agonies of his self-absorbed and aimless clients, an Australian psychiatrist named W. Béran Wolfe summed up his philosophy like this: “If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, growing double dahlias in his garden, or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert.” He was right. People who strive for something personally significant, whether it’s learning a new craft, changing careers, or raising moral children, are far happier than those who don’t have strong dreams or aspirations. Find a happy person, and you will find a project. The process of working toward a goal, participating in a valued and challenging activity, is as important to well-being as its attainment. People often feel enormous letdowns after having attained something that they have been striving toward for years. G. K. Chesterton’s words, “There is one thing which gives radiance to everything. It is the idea of something around the corner.” Simultaneously striving for conflicting goals (like “build my business” and “spend more time outdoors”) will make you so annoyed and discouraged that you’ll relinquish both removal of the frown lines makes other people perceive you as happier (and more attractive), and as this investigation shows, people actually do feel happier. Mothers who express positive emotions have infants who begin to express positive emotions as well, If you suddenly experienced a financial windfall, you would ultimately be much happier if you spent the money on numerous pleasant, mood-boosting things occurring on a day-to-day or weekly basis, rather than spend it all on a single big-ticket item that you believe you would really love. To be interested in the changing seasons is a happier state of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring. - George Santayana Renew your commitment every day.","Since I loved Stumbling on Happiness, I was prepared to love this, but the big difference is that Stumbling on Happiness showed tests and experiments to prove their points, whereas this book only presents conclusions. Maybe equally accurate but less convincing."
Personal Development for Smart People,Steve Pavlina,1401922759,6,"########## TRUTH ""What seems nasty, painful, evil can become a source of beauty, joy, and strength, if faced with an open mind."" - Henry Miller Your first commitment must be to discover and accept new truths, no matter how difficult or unpleasant the consequences. Perception is the most basic aspect of truth. If you want to improve some part of your life, you have to look at it first. For example, if you want to know how your relationship is doing, you ask yourself, ""How do I feel about this relationship? What parts are working well? What parts need improvement?"" You can't get from point A to point B if you refuse to acknowledge that you're at point A! What do you perceive about your life that you'd like to change? Are there any addictions or destructive habits you'd like to break? Look around you and notice what you like and dislike about your life. Prediction is how you learn from experience, enabling you to discover what is true. As you observe any new situation or event, one of two things can happen: either the experience will meet your expectations, or it won't. When an experience meets your expectations, your mental model of reality remains intact. But when an experience violates your expectations, your mind must update its model of reality to fit the new information. This is how you learn from experience and discover new truths. If something satisfies all your expectations, you won't learn anything new. To help you grow, something (this book) must violate your expectations and give you some unexpected ""Aha!"" moments. There are two powerful ways you can apply your mind's predictive powers to accelerate your personal growth: 1. Embrace new experiences that are unlike anything you've previously encountered. You'll literally become more intelligent. New situations shift your mind into learning mode, which enables you to discover new patterns. The more patterns your mind learns, the better it gets at prediction, and the smarter you become. Read a book on a topic that's completely alien to you. Talk to people you'd normally avoid. Visit an unfamiliar city. Stretch beyond the patterns your mind has already learned. In order to grow, you must repeatedly tackle fresh challenges and consider new ideas to give your mind fresh input. If you merely repeat the same experiences, you'll stagnate, and your mental capacity will atrophy. If you want to become smarter, you must keep stirring things up. 2. Make conscious deliberate predictions and use those predictions to make better decisions. Think about where you're headed and ask yourself, ""How do I honestly expect my life to turn out?"" Imagine that a very logical impartial observer examines your situation in detail, and predicts what your life will look like in 20 years, based on your current behavior. What kind of future will this person predict for you? Positive feelings stem from positive predictions. When you feel good, your mind is anticipating a positive outcome. When you feel bad, your mind expects an unfavorable outcome. The closer your internal model of reality matches actual reality, the more capable you become. Accept the long-term consequences of your predictions. Do you accept the truth of where you'll likely end up? Are you willing to live with those consequences? Whatever you fear, you must eventually face. Don't deny the truth of the situation. Never pretend to be happy. Make your important decisions from the most reasonable thinking you can muster - when you feel alert, clearheaded, and intelligent. Put the decisions in writing and fully commit yourself to them. When you inevitably sink back to lower states and lose sight of the higher perspective, continue to act on those decisions even though you may no longer feel as committed to them. When you make choices from a place of anger, fear, sadness, or guilt, you cannot be aligned with truth because your predictions will be negatively biased by those lower states. Positive emotions can make you overly optimistic, encouraging you to take unreasonable risks and to make overaggressive promises that you won't keep. Secondary gain is when you temporarily benefit(gain) by embracing falsehood. Lying to get ahead. Etc. The more you succumb to secondary gain, the phonier you become as a human being. Instead of abiding friendship and human intimacy, you settle for a sea of casual contacts, none of whom know, accept, and love the real you. The pursuit of secondary gain leads to persistent dissatisfaction, emptiness, and unhappiness. Rate the different areas of your life each from 1 to 10: - Habits & daily routine - Career & work - Money & finances - Health & fitness - Education - Social & relationships - Home & family - Emotions - Character & integrity - Life purpose & contribution - Spiritual development Take every rating that isn't a 9 or 10 and replace it with a 1. A 7 is what you get when you allow too much falsehood and denial to creep into your life - when you know you don't have what you want, but you aren't ready to face up to it yet. A 7 is a comfortable living arrangement instead of a deeply fulfilling relationship. Look at each part of your life again, and ask yourself: What do I truly want? What is my dream, my grand vision? What is the deep desire I've been longing for - the one that I hesitate to admit because I don't think I can have it? What path do I most want to experience? Accept that you want what you want, and stop living in denial of your true desires. Media fast : For 30 days, no TV, and avoid all newspapers, magazines, online media sources. Unplug yourself completely and see what happens. ########## LOVE One of the fundamental choices you face in every encounter is the choice to approach or avoid. You can try to connect with people, or you can pull away from them. You can immerse yourself in your day's work, or you can procrastinate. You can approach any person, place, or thing with the intention to connect, or you can remain aloof and keep your distance. The decision to connect is the essence of love. By your actions, you decide what to link up with and what to avoid. Whenever you choose to make one connection, you simultaneously choose not to connect with all of the other possibilities. Your life becomes a reflection of what you choose to connect with most often. When you feel good about your connections, you come into greater alignment with the principle of love. You must master the art of forming connections. Give something your attention. Think about it. Engage with it. Whether groups, objects, places, ideas, values, and activities. Establishing a link requires nothing but your attention. Put your attention on something and you immediately connect with it. The best way to fulfill our desires is to walk up to whatever interests us and engage with it directly. You communicate effectively by first connecting with the familiar and then branching out into the unfamiliar. When you meet someone new, the first step is to discover your shared interests, values, and attitudes. This creates a basic bond of trust and friendship. The next step is to explore and learn from your differences. Don't forget that the primary purpose of communication is to create a connection with the other person. Your connection with another person is whatever you think it is. Your belief makes the relationship real. If you cease to believe in it, it no longer exists. The true purpose of relationships is self-exploration. When you feel a deep sense of communion with another person, you're actually connecting deeply with an important part of yourself. By communing with others, you learn to love yourself more fully. Presuppose everyone else is a part of you, just like one of your own dream characters. There are no strangers. There are no insignificant people. Everyone has something to teach you. Instead of having to break the ice with someone, assume there is no ice. When you fail to release incompatibilities from your life, you settle for mere tolerance and prevent compatible new connections from forming. # Time Travel Meditation: Imagine having a conversation with your future self, 5 years from now. Ask anything you want, and listen for the answers. Imagine having a conversation with your past self, from 5 years ago. I am now that person's future self. What was my life like 5 years ago? What would he be asking the current me? Imagine answering how life turned out, answering with reassurance. Tell my past self about the challenges coming in the years ahead (that I've already faced). Now future self comes back into the room. The 3 versions merge into light. One of the easiest ways to lovingly connect with a person is to share something with them. Share a conversation. Share experiences. Share stories. Share laughs. Share a meal. Share a game. Share yourself. When you want to develop a deeper bond with someone you've just met, mentally fast-forward your relationship with that person in your mind's eye. Imagine a future time when the two of you have been friends for years. Feel the emotional bond between you becoming stronger. When you learn to love everyone and everything, you come into alignment with your true self. ########## POWER Power is your ability to consciously and deliberately create the world around you. No matter your history, the burden of responsibility for your life now rests squarely on your shoulders. Blame can only make you powerless. No one is coming to rescue you. If you don't proactively solve your own problems, they'll never be solved. If you want different results, you must go out and create them yourself. Desire is the fuel of power. Enjoy the progressive fulfillment of your desires through the exercise of your power. What do you want? What do you fantasize about? What do you long for so badly that you can't stop thinking about it, even if you consider it impossible? Never deny that you want what you want. When you deny your desires, you fall out of alignment. You're completely free to decide what you want. You don't need anyone's permission or approval. Your choices are yours to make and can never be dictated by others. You never need to justify what you want. You want what you want, and that is enough. Life is constantly asking, ""What do you want?"" Answer that question however you wish. True power only exists in the present. There is no power in the past. It's done. There is no power in the future. It's only in your imagination. You have no power to act yesterday or tomorrow. Whenever you project beyond the present, you make yourself powerless because you're succumbing to an illusion. The purpose of goal-setting isn't to control the future. The point of goal-setting is to improve the quality of the present. Ask, ""How does setting this goal improve my present reality?"" If it doesn't, then the goal is pointless. But if it brings greater clarity, focus, and motivation to your life when you think about it, it's a keeper. Set goals that make you feel powerful, motivated, and driven when you focus on them, long before the final outcome is actually achieved. Avoid setting goals that make you feel powerless, stressed, or weak. When you set a goal that improves your present reality, what does it matter how long it takes to achieve the final outcome? Whether it takes one week or five years is irrelevant. The whole path is fun and enjoyable. Whenever I focus on an inspiring goal, I feel extremely driven and motivated. Material goals always de-motivate me. If you find yourself unmotivated, you've set the wrong goals. You need to set goals that are so inspiring to you that you can't wait to take action. Self-discipline is the willingness to do what it takes to achieve the results you want regardless of your mood. When you're feeling unmotivated, apathetic, bored or lazy, self-discipline provides your second wind and keeps you moving. Motivation is highest at the beginning of a project. Self-discipline can prevent you from quitting. Motivation starts the race, but self-discipline crosses the finish line. Self-discipline remains one of the most significant aspects of personal development. Progressive training requires that once you succeed, you must increase the challenge. If you keep working at the same level, you won't get much stronger. The first hour is the rudder of the day. Adopt a disciplined routine for the first waking hour, and you'll enjoy a highly productive day. ########## ONENESS Ask myself, ""Where is the joy?"" Listen for the right frequency. Once I got it, increase the volume until I'm feeling extremely joyful and connected. Strive to be direct and forthright. Genuine honesty is truth tempered with love. Using truth as a weapon is not a loving act, but shedding light on an otherwise dark situation is certainly in our best interests. Even when it seems painful and embarrassing to tell the truth, you do more damage by holding back. In order to truly experience unconditional love, you must make yourself naked to the world. Instead of being more generous with your friends and family members as opposed to strangers, oneness will encourage you to be more generous in those areas where you can have a greater impact, regardless of your current social loyalties. Everyone is part of your family. In a broader social context, fairness takes the form of justice. We must make decisions that fairly balance the needs of the individual with the needs of the larger whole. Whenever we turn a blind eye to injustice, we embrace separation instead of oneness. If you live entirely for yourself, like will amount to very little against the backdrop of all humanity. By aligning yourself with the highest good, your role takes on much greater significance. You can't continue making decisions solely at the personal, family, or communal level. You must consider how your thoughts and actions impact the planet as a whole. To deny such responsibility is to succumb to an illusion. You can't avoid the responsibility for what happens on earth because you're a part of it. If you think the planet needs saving, you're responsible for saving it. If you think our leaders have gotten off track, you're responsible for getting us back on track. If you see problems in the world that aren't adequately being addressed, you're responsible for addressing those problems. You don't need to build a vast global operation to cure every problem on earth. You just need to remain aware of how your actions affect the whole and start making decisions today to align yourself with the greater good. Spending time in nature is one of the simplest things you can do to experience oneness. Stop doing, stop thinking, and just be among the plants and animals. ########## AUTHORITY Authority is the principle devised from truth and power. Truth without power accomplishes nothing. Power without truth generates wasted action. When you live without authority, your default behavior is to squander your time. You may acquire some knowledge, but you won't apply it well. You may take some action, but your movements will be chaotic and unfocused. You have the potential to live a powerful self-directed life of your choosing, but until you step into your true authority, this potential remains a fantasy. With authority, you not only assume responsibility for your life, you take complete command of it. There's only one true authority in your life, and it's you. You make the decisions. There's no higher authority in this life than you. If you fail to claim authority over your own life, someone else will surely claim it for you. Many people allow their spouse, parents, or boss to practically run their lives. You become increasingly helpless as you distance yourself from your true nature. You are meant to be free. Look around you and notice the results you're currently getting. Life is simply obeying your commands. If you want different results, you must issue different orders. Effectiveness is the true measure of authority. Consider two questions: 1. Am I making the correct decisions? 2. Am I taking the correct actions? Notice how elegantly the principles of truth and power work together to improve your personal effectiveness over time: First, you identify one of your desires and make a decision to move toward it. Then you use your predictive abilities to select a reasonable course of action. As you progress toward your goal, you need only identify the next action you predict will move you in the correct direction. You use your power to move yourself forward, one step at a time. Even as you take these microsteps, your predictive mind is always looking ahead, continually refining its selections and evaluating the results of the decisions you've already implemented. Maybe you reach your goal; maybe you don't. Either way you experience a powerful gain. When you succeed, your successful predictions, decisions, and behaviors are reinforced. When you fail, your mind learns that its predictions were inaccurate, and it updates your model of reality to help prevent you from repeating the same mistakes. Failure is your friend. While it's often disappointing to miss the goal you aimed for, there's always a consolation prize. When you fail, you become smarter. You teach your mind to become better at prediction. This is an immensely powerful result. After thousands of cycles of identifying and fixing mistakes, I became a very good programmer. You can't expect to be competent when you tackle something new, but you can expect that you'll improve over time. All you have to do is set a goal, make decisions that you think will lead you in the right direction, and keep taking action. Either you'll succeed, or you'll learn from your failures. If you fail a great deal, it just means you have more to learn before you're ready to succeed. Be willing to make decisions that may fail. Even though failure may have negative consequences, it also yields important positive results. It ultimately teaches you to succeed. You can't be a true authority unless you commit to being a lifelong student. If you quit too early, you'll never complete the shift from novice to expert. The expert level is where most of the rewards are found. Understand that failure and success are not opposites. Failure is an unavoidable part of success. When you fail, it means you're taking action, so you're making mistakes and educating yourself. Success happens naturally once you finally learn how to take the correct actions. Don't pressure yourself to achieve massive success the first time out. Just do the best you can. At first, your best may be barely above idiot. Eventually you'll gain some basic competency, and farther down the road, people will call you an expert. An expert being a person who's failed enough to succeed. Eventually they learn what they need to learn. They successfully adapt their predictions to fit reality, and finally their actions begin producing the intended results. If you're clear about what you want, settle for nothing less. Accept that success will take time, perhaps much longer than you'd like. Rid yourself of the fast and easy, something-for-nothing mindset. Keep your head down, work hard, and know that your efforts will eventually pay off, as long as you keep learning and growing. As you perceive reality with increasing accuracy, your decisions will improve, and in turn so will your actions and thereby your results. Accurate beliefs lead to effective results, and confidence is the emotional residue of effectiveness. You feel confident when you can expect positive results from your actions with a high degree of certainty. Power can be applied to meaningless pursuits, or it can be channeled toward significant achievements. What's important to you in life? What's a relative waste of your time? TRIAGE can help you focus your attention on the most significant actions. Divide between: 1. projects that will fail to have a significant impact, whether you do them or not 2. projects that will succeed anyway, whether you do them or not 3. projects that will have a significant impact only if you complete them in a timely manner Ask yourself, ""Is this the most important thing for me to be doing right now?"" What are the group-3 projects that are dying in the trenches, but can still be saved if you reach them in time? Your health? Your relationship? Your career? In order to make time to save them, which group-1-and-2 are you willing to pass up? Don't blindly follow the advice of experts. Find out what works best for you by conducting personal experiments. Don't dismiss any ideas until you've actually tried them. Get in touch with what's most important to you in life. If you felt responsible for the entire world, what would you want to change first? ########## COURAGE When your mind predicts a positive long-term outcome, but a negative short-term outcome from a course of action, courage is required to bridge the gap. Courage is the application of power to break through short-term challenges in order to achieve long-term goals. Whatever you fear, you must eventually face. What if you know you're on the wrong path, but don't know how to find the right one? Get off the road you're on. Just stop. If you can't see the right path from your current location, go out and explore. Don't wait for a new career, a new relationship, or other opportunities to come to you. Go out and actively create what you want. Life is waiting for you to make the first move. If you want something, ask for it. Accept the risk of rejection and summon the courage to take action anyway. If you don't get rejected, you'll achieve your outcome in the fastest and simplest way possible. An honest rejection is always better than a clever deception. Short bursts of courage can overcome many obstacles. Consciously commit yourself to a principle-centered life. This commitment is called honor. The guiding force of honor is your conscience. Service to self and service to others are the same thing. When you feel lazy and unmotivated, you're feeling disconnected. Remember who you are. Reconnect with what excites you. Revisit those times in your life when you were on fire - not because of external events, but because you were aligned with your truth. Whatever scares you, learn more about it. The knowledge you acquire will help you act more courageously and intelligently. It's amazing how many opportunities we deny ourselves due to lack of knowledge or experience. In this info age, ""I don't know"" is not a valid excuse. All the information you need is readily accessible online, in books, or on other people's minds. If ignorance is holding you back in any area of your life, take the initiative and educate yourself. Make commitments that don't require much courage to accept, but that require significant courage to implement. ########## INTELLIGENCE Intelligence is alignment with truth, love, and power. As you interact with others, neither exaggerate nor downplay what's true for you. Be completely real. Your honest won't always get you a positive response, but allow others to have their reactions without feeling you must pretend to be something you're not. If you try to slant the truth in order to tell people what you think they want to hear, you disconnect from your true self, and you encourage others to live in denial of their own power. For many years, I believed the best way to relate to other people was to try to meet them at their own level of power. If someone was timid, I'd downplay my accomplishments because I didn't want them to feel uncomfortable. These friendships were rooted in falsehood, and to maintain them, I became increasingly disconnected with myself. When I stay connected with myself, I am more selective about the people I decide to connect with, so I seek out friends who are consciously growth oriented and not complacent or apathetic. A fascinating quality of intelligence is that it seeks its own improvement. The smartest choice we can make is to attempt to become smarter, and growth is the mechanism through which this is achieved. It is intelligent to grow. Working on your personal growth is the most selfless thing you can possibly do. You increase your capacity to serve others. The most intelligent thing you can do with your life is to grow. The state of flow results from conscious thought and action in the direction of your dreams. Learn to satisfy your desires and fulfill your dreams instead of pretending they don't matter to you. When you maintain the state of flow it will feel as if there's powerful energy working through you, driving you onward. You know without a doubt that you're on the right track as you make progress toward something meaningful and important. Knowing you're on the right pathw will reduce your feelings of doubt, worry, and stress. A deep sense of inner peace will arise in their place. It's comforting to know that truth, love, and power are the only guiding principles you really need. You don't need to live by a complicated set of rules, laws, or values. Assess your current alignment with the 7 principles: TRUTH: - Am I truthful with myself and others, or do I feel compelled to lie about anything? - What do I predict will happen if I continue on my current course? - Are my predictions reasonable and accurate, or am I too optimistic or pessimistic? - Do I fully accept the truth of my situation or am I living in denial? - What do I need to learn next, and what's the best way to learn it? - What can I do righ tnow to become more truthful? LOVE: - Do I take time to connect with myself and others, or do I feel disconnected and alone? - Do I express my true self when I communicate, or do I project a false image? - Do I love and accept myself and others unconditionally? - Do I seek out compatible new relationships? - How can I exercise and improve my social skills? - What can I do right now to become more loving? POWER: - Do I accept complete responsibility for everything in my life? - What do I really want, and what am I willing to do to get it? - Am I focusing on what's most important to me, or am I distracting myself? - Am I putting in the time to do what needs to be done? - How can I continue to build my self-discipline? - What can I do right now to become more powerful? ONENESS: - Do I recognize the truth that we're all connected, like individual cells in a larger body? - Can I empathically tune in to the joy and sorrow of others? - Do I treat others with compassion and fairness? - Am I making a meaningful contribution to the world? - Do I think and act with a sense of unity? - What can I do right now to experience more oneness? AUTHORITY: - Do I take command of my life, or do I blindly follow others? - Are my actions effective, producing the results I want? - Do I persist in the face of obstacles and setbacks, or do I give up too easily? - Am I confident that I'll achieve the goals I set for myself? - How can I spend my time on what's truly important and avoid wasting time on trivialities? - What can I do right now to increase my authority? COURAGE: - Do I live boldly and courageously, or do I succumb to fear, timidity, and cowardice? - Where is the path with a heart, and what can I do to honor that path right now? - Do I take the initiative, or am I stuck in a waiting mode? - Do I courageously pursue the most direct course, or do I follow a slower more manipulative route? - How can I train and educate myself to overcome my fear? - What can I do right now to exercise my courage? INTELLIGENCE: - Do I live in alignment with truth, love, and power? - Are my interactions with others authentic or phony? - Do I have the right message and the medium for creative self-expression? - Do I enjoy the state of flow by taking intelligent action? - How can I improve myself today? - What can I do right now to express my intelligence? GROWTH BLITZING: For each of the svent principles, set a specific growth target. Decide to make a small improvement in each area. For example: TRUTH - Confess to a lie or secret you've been concealing. - Write down your most realistic prediction for what you think your life will look like 5 years from now. Ask someone to make a similar prediction for you, and compare the answers. - Read a book on a topic you know nothing about. - Invite an intelligent friend to debate you on a subject where you suspect you may hold inaccurate beliefs. - Begin a 30-day media fast.

POWER: - Write a fresh list of goals for every area of your life. - Set aside at least one hour to work on your single most important project, and nothing else. - Do something you've always wanted to do that you can accomplish in less than a day. - Schedule your next day from wake to sleep. Give yourself a 1-10 score at the end of the day. Beat that score next time. - Play a competitive game & bet that you'll win. Bet for something other than money. ONENESS: - Perform an act of kindness for a stranger. - Post a painful story from your past, online - so others can benefit from your lessons learned. - Identify where you've been unfair to someone, and take immediate action to remedy the situation. - Spend a couple hours alone in nature.

COURAGE: - Make a new request of someone who recently rejected you. - Do something worthwhile that you've been afraid to pursue. - Walk up to someone and tell them exactly what you want from them. - Make an advance commitment to something specific that makes facing one of your fears unavoidable. - Do one thing today that scares you. INTELLIGENCE: - Call someone you know and communicate as authentically as possible during the entire call. - Draw something that represents the real you. - Identify a recent setback, and make a creative plan to work around it. - Visit a museum and look for expressions of truth, love, and power in every exhibit. - Brainstorm a list of 20 new ideas you can use to improve your life. One week is a reasonable timeframe for completing one action from each principle. Whenever you add another activity to your life, treat it as a small universe that comes pre-aligned with truth, love, and power. ########## HABITS Habits are memorized solutions. When your mind figures out how to get something done, it saves the solution, which is reinforced whenever you apply it. Habits are your mind's approach to time management. It would be extremely inefficient for you to consciously decide how to spend every minute of every day - and solve the same problems over & over - so it delegates known problems to your subconscious mind in order to recall and apply the memorized solutions. Now your conscious mind is free to focus on higher-level functions. Sometimes your subconscious mind will memorize inefficient, inaccurate, or ineffective solutions. You must eventually uproot and replace habits that have serious negative side effects. What are your best habits? What are your worst? Do you have any addictions? What habits are you hiding? What habits are you most proud of? If you could snap your fingers and change this habit immediately, would you? Brainstorm all the habits you'd like to implement. If you successfully adopt these habits today, what will your life look like 10 years from now? Enlist the help of others to dramatically increase your chances of success. Seek out role models who've already achieved what you desire, and request advice or mentoring. Ask yourself if there are any incompatible connections you need to release. Change your circumstances to stop reinforcing your old patterns. Assemble the proper scaffolding to support your new desired behaviors. *** Here's a list of habits that can help boost your personal effectiveness: - Daily goals. Set targets for each day in advance. Decide what you'll do, then do it. Without a clear focus, it's too easy to succumb to distractions. - Worst first. To defeat procrastination, learn to tackle your most unpleasant task first thing in the morning, instead of delaying it until later. The small victory will set the tone for a very productive day. - Peak times. Identify your peak cycles of productivity, and schedule your most important tasks for those times. Work on minor tasks during your nonpeak times. - No-comm zones. Allocate uninterruptable blocks of time for solo work where you must concentrate. Schedule light, interruptable tasks for your open-communication periods and more challenging projects for your blackout periods. - Mini-milestones. When you begin a task, identify the target you must reach before you can stop working. For example when writing a book, you could decide not to get up until you've written at least 1000 words. Hit your target no matter what. - Timeboxing. Give yourself a fixed time period - 30 minutes for example - to make a dent in a task. Don't worry about how far you get. Just put in the time. - Batching. Batch similar tasks such as phone calls or errands together, and knock them out in a single session. - Early bird. Get up at 5am and go straight to work on your most important task. You can get more done before 8am than most people do in a full day. - Pyramid. Spend 15-30 minutes doing easy tasks to warm up, then tackle your most difficult project for several hours. Finally end with another 15-30 minutes of easy tasks to transition out of work mode. - Tempo. Deliberately pick up the pace and try to move a little faster than usual. - Neat freak. Reduce stress by making a relaxing clutter-free home and office. - Agendas. Provide clear written agendas to meeting participants in advance. Improves focus and efficiency. - Pareto principle : 80-20 rule. Focus on that 20% and don't overengineer the noncritical 80%. - Ready-fire-aim. Bust procrastination by immediately taking action on a goal, even if the action isn't perfectly planned. Adjust your course along the way. - Minuteman. Once you have the info you need to make a decision, give yourself 60 seconds to come to a clear choice. One the decision is made, take some kind of action to set it in motion. - Set a deadline for task completion, and use it as a focal point to stay on track. - Promise. Tell others of your commitments so they'll hold you accountable. - Punctuality. Arrive early for appointments. Punctuality enhances authority. - Gap reading. Read books & articles while waiting for an appointment or standing in line. - Resonance. Visualize your goal as already accomplished. Put yourself into a state of already being there. - Prizes. Give yourself frequent rewards for achievement. Movie, massage, amusement park. - Prioritize important from merely urgent. Exercise, writing, relationship. Put aside time for these. - At the end of the day, identify the first thing you'll do tomorrow. Set materials in advance. - Break complex projects into smaller well-defined tasks. Focus on completing just one. - Once you begin a task, stick with it until it's 100% complete. Don't switch in the middle. When distractions arise, write them down to deal with later. - Pick a random piece of a larger project, and complete it. Then select another random one and repeat. - Defeat perfectionism by completing a task in an intentionally horrible way. Then nowhere to go but up. - Convince someone else to do something for you. Offer fair trade or reasonable payment. - Learn new skills that are unrelated to work. Martial arts, foreign language, chess. Ideas will cross-pollinate. - Go with your gut intuition. It's probably right. - Identify the proceses you use most, and write them down step-by-step. Rework them for greater efficiency, then test your improved processes. Sometimes we can't see what's in front of us until we use a microscope. - Do one hideous project for just one session a week, 15 minutes total. Then stop & wait another week. - Schedule a specific time for working on a particular task or habit. One hour a day could leave you with a healthier body, finished book, or new business a year later. - Build a new habit by tacking a task onto one of your existing habits. Water the plants after you eat lunch. Send thank-you notes after you check email. - Inject a task into another. Read while eating. Return calls while commuting. Listen to audio while shopping. - Send a thank-you card. - Train up your skill in various productivity habits. Increase typing speed. Improve communication skills. - Say no to noncritical requests for your time. If people get upset, let them. - Reclaim other people's wasted time for yourself. Visualize goals during boring speeches. - Mastermind. Explain your most challenging problems to several people, and invite all the advice and criticism you can handle. - Write down 20 creative ideas for improving your effectiveness. - Make a task harder and more challenging. It's more engaging and motivating than boring ones. Do chores with your nondominant hand. Answer all emails in haiku. - Do boring tasks as if insane. In crayon. In weird accents. - Experiment with how music can boost your effectiveness. - Estimate how long a task will take to complete. Then push yourself to complete it in half that time. - When something undesirable is delegated to you, delegate it to someone else. - When something undesirable is delegated to you, bounce it back to the person who assigned it to you, and challenge them to justify its necessity. - Quit clubs, projects, and subscriptions that take more of your time than they're worth. - Stop caffeine. - Delay noncritical tasks as long as you can. Many won't need to be done at all. - Stop TV. - Time and log all your tasks for an entire day or an entire week. Monitoring your time can boost effectiveness tremendously. - Do the task that scares you the most. Tackle it immediately. - Run errands at unpopular times to avoid the crowd. - Do all shopping online. - Add reminders to your calendar in advance, so you can buy gifts then instead of last-minute. - Do it now! Recite this over & over until you're sick of it, cave it, and get to work. - Hire a personal coach to stay motivated, focused, and accountable. - Read books and articles, listen to audio, and attend seminars to absorb fresh ideas and inspiration. - Gym rat. Exercise daily. Boost metabolism, concentration, and mental clarity in 30 minutes a day. - Banish trolls from your life. Associate with positive happy people instead. No pity posse. - Practice giving someone the evil eye, and use it when someone interrupts your important tasks. - Outsource your problems. How many can be solved more easily if you define them in financial terms? - Modeling. Find people who are already getting the results you want, interview them, and adopt their attitudes, beliefs, and behavior. - Even if others disagree with you, take action anyway, and deal with the consequences later. - Real life : give online life a rest, and reinvest that time into your real offline life. For each habit you consider, ask yourself: Is this really me? Is this consistent with who I want to be? If any part of your life feels phony and inauthentic, replace it with a more genuine alternative. Your habits put your results on autopilot, so you need to ensure that those results are aligned with what you want. ########## CAREER Most job titles are defined in terms of media, including doctors, lawyers, pilots, etc. But the medium is only a shell. Your medium is how you express yourself, but your message is what you express. Someone could use the same media to express an entirely different message. A doctor's message could be about healing, compassion, discovery, education, or anything else. Just because two people share the same medium (being a doctor) doesn't mean they have the same message. Your true career path is about your message, not your medium. Write, ""What is my true purpose in life?"" Write down any answer. Repeat until you write the answer that makes you cry. The author's is ""To live consciously and courageously. To enjoy, increase, and share peace, energy, passion, and abundance. To resonate with love and compassion. To awaken the great spirits within others. And to fully embrace this present moment."" Where is the career path that terrifies you - stirs your soul - that you secretly fantasize about? If you aren't doing something that scares you and challenges you, you're missing golden opportunities that could make a real difference. When people ask me what their odds of success are in some endeavor, my response is, ""If you train in martial arts, what are the odds of becoming a black belt? Does it make any difference what percentage of white belts become black belts? All that matters is whether you're committed to becoming a black belt. You decide whether you make it or not."" ########## MONEY Money is the primary social resource. We assign it value through social agreements. Money is social credit - an IOU from society. The more money you have, the more society owes you, and the more value you can extract. The truth about what it means to earn money : Since money is a social resource, earning money means acquiring more of that resource. When you spend, you convert money to value. But when you earn, you convert value to money. The difference between earning $25/hr vesus $250/hr is that the latter work has much greater social value. This isn't anyone's fault. The difference is due to the social consensus about the value of certain work. Either you're creating genuine social value and being fairly compensated for it, or you're mooching off the value created by others. If you want to earn income, you must impart social value, not personal value. Personal value is whatever you say it is. You're free to decide what has value for you personally, and it doesn't matter if anyone agrees with you. Social value, however, is determined by social consensus. If you believe that your work has tremendous value, but virtually no one else does, then your work may have high personal value but little or no social worth. Your income depends on the social value of your work, not the personal value. Since money is a social resource backed by collective value, it makes sense that you won't get paid much for providing something of little or no importance to the group. Find a need and fill it. If you want to earn more money, develop your skills and talents to facilitate the creation of lots of social value. Focus on giving, and the getting will largely take care of itself. As you earn a higher income, moochers will project their values onto you, concluding that you must be taking advantage of others for personal gain, just as they are. Instead of focusing on specific financial goals, aim directly for what you think money will give you. If you think money will provide you the freedom to travel, set travel goals instead. If you think money will get you a nicer house, set a goal to have a nicer house instead. If you think money will allow you to make a bigger contribution, set a goal to make bigger contribution instead. There are many ways to achieve your goals that require little or no money. When you decide in advance that a lack of funds is an obstacle to achieving your goals, you disempower yourself. Don't automatically assume that money is necessary to achieve a particular goal. This narrows your options and stunts your creativity. The best way to earn money is to do what you feel is best for everyone - not just yourself. Ask, ""Would anyone cry if I went out of business?"" If the answer is no, you're on the wrong path. When you attempt to satisfy your personal values without providing any real social value, you get the starving-artist syndrome : you may be inspired by work you love doing, but it won't pay the bills. The solution is to work within the area of overlap between your personal values and social values. This will enable you to do what you love while creating something that others treasure as well. Don't force yourself to choose between your integrity and your income - demand that both be satisfied. Ofte the simplest way to create value for others is by sharing what you love to do. Being self-sacrificing runs contrary to the principle of oneness. To sacrifice myself to help others without receiving fair value in return is to enter into an abusive relationship. Keep asking yourself these two questions: How can I create and deliver more value? How can I increase my capacity for value creation? If you want to earn more money, you must train yourself to create and deliver more social value. Don't expect someone else to know what your skills and talents are worth. If you let others determine your salary, it's a safe bet you're being underpaid. You must take the initiative and ask for what you want. If the price you ask is fair and reasonable and if there's genuine social demand for the value you can provide, someone will surely pay you for your efforts. Build a solid case for why you deserve it. Optimize for long-term value creation instead of short-term profit. Bypass the low-hanging fruit and go after the big opportunities, the ones that inspire and challenge you to grow. If there was a charity doing something I thought was so important that I should donate a substantial amount of my own money to it, I'd be doing that work myself. If you give more value than you receive while ensuring you're being treated fairly, and not falling into a pattern of self-sacrifice, the excess value you provide will overflow into public goodwill. ########## RELATIONSHIPS Do your relationships empower or disempower you? Is something still missing? What do you contribute to the people closest to you? Pay special attention to your feelings, since they contain their own predictive intelligence. Positive emotions represent positive predictions, and negative emotions reveal negative predictions. When something feels wrong to me, I know the best thing I can do is go to the other person and explain that something doesn't seem right so that we can work together to sort it out. When you bring truth to your relationships, you build closeness and trust. If you stop deliberately injecting fresh truth into your relationship on a regular basis, distance is created by default. All human relationships are guaranteed to be temporary. What mix of truth, love, and power do you use to connect with others? Realize that your weakest channel will be the source of many of your communication problems. You can actually achieve significant growth in your relationshipsby learning to use your weakest channel when communicating in addition to your strengths. In order to connect, we need some overlap in communication styles. In order to grow, we need some differences in our strategies. The best relationships increase your power. The point of entering into a relationship is to increase your alignment with truth, love, and power. Your best relationships will help you meet your needs, fulfill your desires, gain clarity, and feel more connected. If you succumb to relationships that weaken you or make you feel trapped, you're giving your power away. What do you really want from your relationships? What character qualities do you find most attractive in others? It's important to set standards for deeper levels of bonding. I don't form very close bonds with those who are dishonest, unintelligent, unaware, apathetic, abusive, unfocused, undisciplined, or irresponsible. I look for a commitment to conscious growth. Be careful to avoid relinquishing your power to your relationships. In order to achieve an empowering level of interdependence, you must retain a reasonable degree of independence. If you find yourself unable to make decisions as an individual and must defer to someone else to make all the important choices, you're giving away your power and shirking your responsibility to live your own life. The best way to break the ice with someone is to assume there never was any ice to begin with. If your primary relationship prevents you from connecting deeply with others, you have a cage, not a conscious partnership. (I'm up-front and friendly with people.) If I get a cold response, I move on. Someone who'd respond with aloofness to a friendly overture isn't going to be compatible with me anyway, so there's no need for me to push such people to connect. I'd rather engage with someone who's naturally open and friendly instead of trying to reel in a cold fish. Don't settle for a life filled with shallow, empty interaction. Go for deep connections, and ensure your life is filled with plenty of heart. If it's clear that your current situation is leading you astray, end it. Once you're on your own again, you'll have the opportunity to attract a new partner. ########## SPIRITUALITY Quiet reflection and meditation can be powerful spiritual practices to help you connect within, but it's best if they're combined with abundant social interaction. Personal relationships can be a tremendous source of spiritual growth. While it's possible for us to fall out of touch with reality if we spend too much time alone, such problems are less likely with abundant interaction. If we become too impractical in our thinking, the people around us will tell us we've gone off the deep end. The pursuit of spirituality is really the pursuit of accuracy, where our goal is to develop the most accurate model of reality we can. If we fail to include other human beings in this model, we toss away too much potentially valid information, and our model is doomed to inaccuracy. Are you a capitalist? A Christian? A skeptic? The way these questions are asked assumes you must respond with a yes or a no. But this is like asking if you're an eye, an ear, a nose. It would be more sensible to ask questions such as, ""Do you understand the viewpoint of Christianity?"" One way to balance yourself financially, emotionally, and spiritually is to center your life around service to others. If you focus your efforts on geniune value creation and contribution, you'll eventually be able to manifest happiness, wealth, and a sense of meaning. If you look at this solution financially, it makes sense. If you look at it emotionally, it also works. And if you look at it spiritually, it works there as well. How can you effectively train your spiritual depth perception? Find others with different belief systems that seem to empower them in some specific way, and learn from them. Study people from other cultures. Find out why a Buddhist monk seems so calm, why an athlete can maintain such a high fitness level, or why a billionaire is able to enjoy so much financial abundance.",A broad look at all different aspects of self-improvement. Some unique insights. But it's based on this abstract pyramid of power/love/oneness stuff that I couldn't relate to. Though inbetween those lie some great concrete ideas.
The Culture Code,Clotaire Rapaille,0767920570,6,"The stronger the emotion, the more clearly an experience is learned. The only effective way to understand what people truly mean is to ignore what they say. People give answers they believe the questioner wants to hear. They believe they are telling the truth. The anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss studied kinship, saying that he was not interested in people but in the relationships between them, the ""space between the people."" An uncle does not exist if there is no niece, a wife if there is no husband, a mother if there is no child. Kinship is the structure. Few Japanese children are exposed to Irish culture. Therefore, the extremely strong imprints placed in their subconscious at this early age are determined by the culture in which they are raised. An American child's most active period of learning happens in an American context. Mental structures formed in an American environment fill his subconscious. The child therefore grows up an American. This is why people from different cultures have such different reactions to the same things. Let's take for example peanut butter. Americans receive a strong emotional imprint from peanut butter. Since I was born in France, I learned about peanut butter after the closing of the window in time when I could form a strong emotional association with it. Cultural Unconscious Every culture has it's own mind-set, and that mind-set teaches us about who we are in profound ways. American Culture: We are, in fact, in the full throes of adolescence – and this metaphor extends beyond our relative age as a culture into the way we act and react. We never killed our king because we never actually had one. We rebelled against the only king who ever tried to rule us. Our rebellious period never ended. Looking at our culture through this set of glasses explains why we are so successful around the world selling the trappings of adolescence: Coca-Cola, Nike shoes, fast food, blue jeans, and loud, violent movies. What these figures have in common (people we love, celebrities) and what fascinates us so much is their resistance to growing up. They are forever young at heart, crazy, up and down, one day invincible, one day totally rejected, and they always come back. They are the ""eternal adolescents"" all Americans would love to be. At the same time they are a victory for nonconformity. In America, you can be weird and successful. The American culture exhibits many of the traits consistent with adolescence: intense focus on the ""now,"" dramatic mood swings, a constant need for exploration and challenge to authority, a fascination with extremes, openness to change and reinvention, and a strong belief that mistakes warrant second chances. The American Culture Code for love is FALSE EXPECTATION. If you realize that your unconscious expects you to fail, you can begin to look at love with more sensible goals. While understanding and respecting the tug to find Mr. Right or Ms. Perfect, you can look for someone who can be a partner, a friend, and a caring lover, though she or he can't possibly fulfill all of your needs. When Americans think of seduction, they think of being forced to do things they don't want to do or that they believe they shouldn't do. The American Culture Code for seduction is MANIPULAITON. One of the primary tensions in the American culture is the one between freedom and prohibition. One can look at culture as a survival kit passed down from one generation to the next. The American culture evolved as it did because the pioneers, and later the waves of immigrants who came to our shores, needed to evolve that way if they were to survive the conditions of this vast country. Traits such as Puritanism, a strong work ethic, the belief that people deserve a second chance, and putting a premium on success all helped us to survive in this new world. Swiss culture evolved the way it did, forging multiple cultures into one very strong one, in response to regular threats to Switzerland's survival as a sovereign state. In the words of that great American philosopher Nike, one can boil the American agenda down to three simple words: ""Just do it."" Our champions are athletes, entrepreneurs, police officers, firefighters, and soldiers – all people who take action. We may respect thinkers, but we don't celebrate them nearly as much as we do our action figures. We look at Europe as the old world and America as the new. Yet in many ways, America is one of the oldest of the world's nations. The French Revolution began in 1789, more than a decade after our own revolution. Modern Italy became a nation-state in 1861, The German empire was founded in 1871. Our culture isn't nearly as old as the French, Italian and German cultures (all of which existed long before the current nations of France, Italy, and Germany), but we have existed in our present form longer. We have the oldest written constitution in effect on the entire planet. Hindu Indians believe there are four distinct stages to one's life. Youth is the first and least interesting, something to pass through quickly as you gain the tools necessary to live in the world. The next stage, maturity, is when you have children, make money, and achieve success. The third stage is detachment. Here you step back from the world and the ""rat race,"" choosing instead to read and explore philosophy. In the fourth stage, you become equivalent of a hermit. A key tension in England is the one between detachment and eccentricity. Home is a place where you can do things repeatedly and have a good sense of the outcome - unlike the outside world, where everything can be so unpredictable. Home is a place where doing things again gives them added meaning. The kitchen is the heart of the American home because an essential ritual takes place there: the preparation of the evening meal. This is a ritual filled with repetition and reconnection that leads to replenishment. Making dinner is on Code for home in America. Food is secondary. In China, dinner is all about the food. Food is cooked in multiple locations (the kitchen, the fireplace, outside, even the bathroom) and it has a hugely prominent place in any Chinese home. Food is hanging, drying, and curing everywhere. While the Chinese are eating dinner, they rarely speak with one another. Instead they focus entirely on the food. This is true even at business dinners. One may be in the midst of a spirited conversation about an important deal; when the food comes, all conversation ceases and everyone feasts. When our forefathers came to America and discovered a huge undeveloped land, their first thought wasn't ""Let's have some tea."" It was ""Let's get to work."" There was a New World to create, and it wasn't going to create itself. Americans celebrate work and turn successful businesspeople into celebrities. Donald Trump and Bill Gates are pop stars. Stephen T. Covey, Jack Welch, and Lee Iacocca are mega-selling authors. Instead of Bonjour Paresse, our best-sellers include The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and Good to Great. Work put you in a position to get to know people, excite children, keep family going, or plan your future. Work could make you feel that you were on the map, that you had arrived, or that it was all you did. The American Culture Code for work is WHO YOU ARE. We seek so much meaning in our jobs. If our job feels meaningless, then ""who we are"" is meaningless as well. If we feel inspired, if we believe that our jobs have genuine value to the company we work for (even if that ""company"" is ourselves) and that we are doing something worthwhile in our work, that belief bolsters our sense of identity. This is perhaps the most fundamental reason why it is so important for employers to keep their employees content and motivated. A company operated by people with a negative sense of identity can't possibly run well. Our work ethic is so strong because at the unconscious level, we equate work with who we are and we believe that if we work hard and improve our professional standing, we become better people. Those who fail to act, who accept the limitations of their work with barely a grumble, are likely to feel miserable about their lives. The hopelessness of their jobs has done critical damage to their identities. We love the story of Bill Gates labouring away in his garage, coming up with a great idea, and becoming the richest person in the world. Why? Because it reinforces the notion that ""who we are"" has endless room for growth. The self-made millionaire (or, in Gates's case, ""fifty-billionaire"") is an inspirational symbol for us because it proves that all of us can work hard, find the thing that we do superbly, and forge and extraordinary identity. You never have to be stuck in what you do. Self-reinvention is definitely on Code. If your work no longer provides you with the sense of who you are that you desire, it is not only acceptable but also preferable to seek something new. Americans champion entrepreneurs because they are our most aggressive identity-seekers. They don't wait for someone to tell them what to be, but rather take significant risks to become what they believe they should be. We all want to believe that we are headed somewhere in our work, that we aren't going to stay in the same place for the rest of our lives. Most of us have an ideal job in mind, and it usually involves movement. None of us want to feel that we are ""done"". They feel the need to keep working in order to feel that they still exist. Involving staff in the direction of the company gives them an elevated sense of identity, the feeling that they are integral to the company's success. Similarly, helping employees understand their career paths is on the Code. The team should be regarded as a support group that allows individuals to become champions. Sending an entire team to the Bahamas for a job well done actually blunts an employee's efforts to do his best work. He only needs to perform well enough to help achieve the team objective. If, on the other hand, the employee knew that individual rewards were possible, he would be more likely to strive to outperform expectations. People around the world perceive us as being concerned only with money. This huge misconception is one of the reasons so many of them fail to see what really does motivate us. At the same time, though, Americans themselves perceive this preoccupation with money and think it suggests that we are greedy at heart or that we prize material goods over enhancement of the spirit. This, too is a misconception, one that gives us much less credit than we deserve. The notion that we ""come from nothing"" pervades America. In a sense, we have the poorest rich people in the world, because even those who accumulate huge sums of money think like poor people. They continue to work hard, they continue to focus on cash flow and expenses, and they continue to struggle to earn more. Clearly, money signifies more to Americans than the means to buy things. It shows us how we're doing, tells us how far we've come from impoverished poor roots. Money reminds you that your ""business is a good one,"" that you've worked hard to get something, that you can carry your burdens, that you are appreciated, and that you are moving up to the next level. Not having money makes you feel as if you are ""in a hole""; you may feel that ""it's gonna kill me."" The American culture has no titles of nobility to show us who the big winners are. Without them, we need something that performs a similar function. Participants tell us through their third-hour stories that that thing is money. The American Culture Code for money is PROOF. Money isn't a goal in and of itself for most Americans. We rely on it to show us that we are good, that we have true value in the world. We can prove what we've accomplished only by making as much money as possible. Money is our barometer for success. Most Americans find it impossible to feel successful if they feel they are underpaid. Money is a scorecard. If someone is doing a job similar to yours and making more money, you unconsciously believe that he or she is doing a better job. Being paid for a job imbues it with instant credibility. A publishing contract changes one's attitude about their accomplishments instantly. Suddenly the previous two years of ""unpaid work,"" gain validity. The money the publisher paid is proof. Because we believe money is proof, we see a very strong connection between money and work. Money earned via hard work is admirable, proof that you are a good person. Americans see interest income and capital gains as ""bad money"" because they didn't earn it themselves. Investors who took a very active role in managing their stock portfolio felt they ""made"" this money, while those who simply followed the advice of their bookers did not. On-Code firms portray themselves as facilitators who provide their clients with tools for generating more money. Many European cultures have a different view of money and it's functions. At a certain point, one simply settles back on the estate, leaving the world of commerce behind. Money in France isn't a form of proof, but unpleasant fact. We truly believe there is a link between goodness and monetary success and that those who cheat and lie their way to the top ultimately meet their comeuppance on both the spiritual and financial planes. Consistent with this mind-set is the American attitude towards charitable donations. Americans are the most charitable people in the world. Americans expect their most fortunate to share what they've earned, and we have an entire system of laws in place for giving one's money away. It is off Code, for example, to preach profitability to one's employees. Money is the proof of goodness, not in itself the goal. Instead, a company's management must inspire employees to be the best they can possibly be. This is on Code for both work and money and, if done effectively, leads to profitability. Money alone is the worst reward for an American employee. The most on-Code approach is to use money as a global positioning system that shows the employee where he is on his career path. At every promotion, the employee should be shown a visual representation of the income curve that he or she is on. The angle at which one's salary is climbing is a powerful symbol of growth. It is visual proof. Work is an essential part of who we are we just want a chance to prove ourselves and receive tangible evidence that we have succeeded. The Culture Code for quality in America is IT WORKS. The Culture Code for perfection in America is DEATH. We don't want people telling us what to do and holding us to their standards. We want to discover things and learn how to do things our own way. We had to learn everything ourselves, and we did it the only way we could - through trial and error. Learning from our mistakes not only allowed us to survive, but also helped us to grow into a powerful and hugely successful country. We were rewarded for our ability to pick ourselves up off the ground and do things better the second and third times. Trying, failing, learning from our mistakes, and coming back stronger than ever is an essential part of the American archetype. The Japanese needed to make most of their land, efficiency is critical. Mistakes are costlier. Quality is a necessity. Perfection is premium. Americans find perfection boring. None one of our products needs to perform brilliantly (our cars don't need to be masterpieces of engineering, our cell phones don't need to provide sonic perfection), but they absolutely need to perform. The most important message is that Americans put a premium on functionality. We are not a bells-and-whistles culture. We would rather have a cell phone that always operates when we're in the middle of a call than one that takes pictures, plays music, and allows us to download television clips. A car that reliably gets us to work, the supermarket, or soccer practice is much more valuable to us than one that corners masterfully or has rain-sensing windshield wipers. We expect our products to break down. However, because our Code for quality is IT WORKS, we expect problems to be resolved quickly and with a minimum of disruption. Americans are far more responsive to good service than they are to perfection (which they don't believe in anyway). Crisis is a great opportunity to create loyalty. If a customer comes to you with a problem with a product or service and you solve that problem quickly and minimize the customer's inconvenience, you will likely earn that customer's dedication. You have proven yourself to the customer. The bottom line is that great service is more important to Americans than great quality. When one seeks to bring something new to a culture, one must adapt the idea to the culture. It doesn't work the other way. You can trace many of the American traits to our humble beginnings. Though we are the richest country in the world, as we discussed earlier, at the reptilian level we consider ourselves poor. We start out with nothing and we labor to achieve wealth, and even though we may succeed, the hand-to-mouth attitude remains. The response of poor people to food is consistent throughout the world: they eat as much as they can when they can, because they don't know whether they will have the opportunity to eat the next day. The average American spends six minutes eating dinner. The American Culture Code for food is FUEL. In Japan, food is a means to approach perfection. Alibis give ""rational"" reasons for doing the things we do. An effective marketing campaign needs to consider the alibis while addressing the Code. While you can't believe what people say, it would be a mistake not to listen to it and incorporate it info your message. The American Culture Code for shopping is RECONNECTING WITH LIFE. Shopping is a social experience, a way for us to encounter a wide variety of people and learn what's new in the world. The Code taps into the adolescent component of our culture. We all want to ""go out and play."" We aren't going to learn anything sitting alone at home. Only when we go out into the world do we discover anything new about life. Buying is about carrying out a specific mission. It's a task. Shopping is a wondrous experience filled with discovery. Consumers like the synergy between the buying they can do online and the shopping they can do at a retail outlet. Buying signals the end of shopping, the point at which you sever your connection with the world and go back home. Returns offer the consumer an alibi for returning to the store. Nordstrom has based part of its reputation on its willingness to take items back with no questions asked. They've turned shopping into an open-ended experience. The French Culture Code for shopping is LEARNING YOUR CULTURE. They consider their shopping an educational experience. From a business perspective, one is on Code whenever one underscores shopping as a joyful, life-affirming experience. Making shoppers feel that they can browse without pressure to make a buying decision is a very good thing, as is creating a space for them to linger (many bookstores have done this by adding cafés). Establishing a store as a place where people can gather and reconnect. With the exception of convenience stores, emphasizing the efficiency with which the consumer can make purchases is off Code. While telling people they can get in and out of your store quickly seems to make sense at the cortical level. If flies directly in the face of the Code. Telling shoppers they can have a fast shopping experience in your store is a little bit like trying to sell a thirty-second massage or half a piece of chocolate. Luxury in France represents the freedom to do nothing and to own useless things. French expression: ""What is useless is what I cannot live without."" The British use luxury to underscore their sense of detachment. They'll join exclusive clubs where they can show one another how unimpressed they are with their own status. Since we believe that you are never finished growing, our rank should come in stages, reaching a higher level the more we accomplish. The way we show our rank in American society is through our luxury items, and the American Culture Code for luxury is MILITARY STRIPES. As we achieve higher rank in the civilian words, we expect privileges and services unavailable to the average American. Service is a luxury item. When we achieve a certain level of success, we rarely say ""I've arrived; I'm done."" Most of us immediately think about achieving greater success. A company that offers multiple levels of luxury has the opportunity to keep its customers as they ascend. Our cultural unconsciousness will lead us to respond positively to luxury items that offer us "" stripes,"" but our cortexes must be satisfied as well. We'll buy a $4,000 professional cooktop, but only if you convince us that it will make our kitchen more functional. We'll spend an extra $200 a day for spa services in our four–star hotel, but only if you convince us that we'll emerge refreshed and ready to resume our mission. Participants in France talked about the confusion that stemmed from their belief that they were supposed to illuminate the world with their ideas but that the Americans were actually doing it. The Code for America in France is SPACE TRAVELERS. Germans see themselves as superior in education. The Code for America in Germany is JOHN WAYNE. The English Code for America is UNASHAMEDLY ABUNDANT. The English expect us to seek abundance in everything. They expect us to be extreme and to try to win at any cost. The French Code for France is IDEA. Raised on stories of great French philosophers and thinkers, French children imprint the value of ideas as paramount and refinement of the mind as the higher goal. The French Code for England is CLASS. Culture Code for Germany is ORDER. When a person sees something in a foreign culture that feels more consistent with his own worldview, moving to that culture can make a great deal of sense. French living in America are optimistic, helpful, generous, and enthusiastic about new opportunities. In other words, there are Americans. As with corporations, the key to successful immigration (here or elsewhere) is connecting with the Code of the local culture. An intellectual from any culture would find France stimulating. A control freak would resonate strongly with the German culture. Like all adolescents, we have little patience for father figures. However, we are happy to follow a rebel as he leads the charge. Our leader is the person who leads the rebellion. This is essential in a culture where health means movement. We are always changing, always moving forward, always reinventing, and we want a president who can direct this process. The president needs to understand what is broken, have a strong idea about how to fix it, and then "" rebel"" against the problem. We don't want our presidents to think too much. We don't want a father figure. We want a biblical figure. The Culture Code for the American presidency is MOSES. Strip away the religious components of the story of Moses, you'll see that he represents the Code for the American presidency aptly: a rebellious leader of his people with a strong vision and the will to get them out of trouble. The French, on the other hand, rally behind leaders who challenge the system with new ideas (remember, the French code for France is IDEA). Napoleon and de Gaulle are considered models of French leadership because they faced down the existing system and changed it to better serve the people. American's don't want father figures who tell them what to do, but they do want men (and someday, maybe even soon, women) with a plan they can understand and follow. So how do Americans see America? Certainly, we see ourselves as "" new."" We also see ourselves as occupants of vast amounts of space. Just as the Japanese are the masters of micro-culture because they must fit a huge number of people into a small space, Americans are the masters of macro–culture. American Culture Code for America is DREAM. Even our cultural adolescence is a dream: we want to believe we are forever young and that we never truly have to grow up. It is entirely on Code for people to change careers, locales, or living situations as long as they genuinely believe that doing so gives them a chance to grow. Cultures perceive globalization as a direct attack on their survival. When brands extend themselves into the global market by championing their villages of origin, they accomplish two tasks at once: they perpetuate their own culture and they celebrate everyone's cultural identity. When one associates a brand with the place that gave birth to that brand, the brand becomes an essential part of the landscape. And while landscapes evolve over time, time does not diminish them.",Weird look at how different cultures (mostly Europe versus U.S. in this book) see things differently. Example: British luxury is about detachment whereas U.S. luxury is about rank.
The Four Pillars of Investing,William Bernstein,0071385290,6,"## CH 1 : No Guts, No Glory High previous returns usually indicate low future returns, and low past returns usually mean high future returns. (This point cannot be made too forcefully or too often.) The low prices that produce high future returns are not possible without catastrophe and risk. The recent high returns for the U.S would not have been possible without the chaos of the 19th century and the prolonged fall in prices that occured in the wake of the Great Depression. When the sun shines the brightest, investment returns are the lowest. Stability and prosperity imply high asset prices, which result in low future returns. The highest returns are obtained by shouldering prudent risk when things look bleakest. The real value of historical record is a gauge of risk, not return. Assuming the risks are the same, there is no reason that the future return in any one nation should be higher than another. To the extent that one nation is perceived to be riskier than another, the nation with the highest perceived risk should have the highest future return, in order to compensate for the extra risk. The shares of good companies (Wal-Mart) are called ""growth stocks"", and those of bad companies (Kmart) are called ""value stocks"". Wal-Mart is safer, and Kmart is at risk of collapse. So... Since Kmart is a much riskier company than Wal-Mart, investors expect a higher return from Kmart than they do Wal-Mart. If Kmart had the same expected return as Wal-Mart, no one would buy it! So its price must fall to the point where its expected return exceeds Wal-Mart. The key word is ""expected"", since there's no guarantee. So... One of the most counterintuitive points in all of finance: Good companies are generally bad stocks, and bad companies are generally good stocks. (Studies prove this in many nations over long periods of time. Unglamorous unsafe value stocks with poor earnings have higher returns than glamorous growth stocks with good earnings.) Eugene Fama and Kenneth French. 1975-1996 across many countries, value stocks had a 5.28% average greater return than growth stocks. Campbell Harvey @ Duke University extended this work to entire nations: returns are higher in the bad nations with the shakiest financial systems - because the risk there is highest. The longer a risky asset is held, the less the chance of a loss. Be wary of data demonstrating the superior long-term performance of U.S. stocks. For most of its history, the U.S. was a very risky place to invest, and its high investment returns reflect that. Now the U.S. is a ""sure thing"", prices have risen, and future investment returns will necessarily be lower. ## CH 2 : Measuring the Beast (Based on the book : ""The Theory of Interest"" by Fisher, 70 years ago) Discounted Dividend Model = DDM. It's the ultimate answer to the age-old question of how to separate speculation from investment. The value of a stock or bond is simply the present value of its future income stream. (Understand this and you'll know more than most professionals.) Wealth is a stream of income. This income stream must be reduced in value (or ""discounted"") to the present, to reflect the fact that it is worth less than currently-received income. The rate at which that income is discounted is inversely related to the asset's value - a high discount rate lowers the asset's value. The discount rate is the same as the asset's expected return. It's determined by the asset's perceived risk. A rare coin or painting is a speculation, since it's dependent on someone else paying yet a higher price for them later (the ""greater fool"" theory). A fine painting (by an old master), like a house, is neither a speculation nor an investment: it is a purchase. The dividend it produces is of the non-financial variety. Only an income-producing possession, such as a stock, bond, or working piece of real estate is a true investment. Any stock price above zero proves some investors consider it possible that the stock will regain its earnings and produce dividends in the future. Ben Graham pointed out : a stock purchased with the hope that its price will soon rise independent of its divident-producing ability is also a sepculation, not an investment. Discounted Dividend Model: 1- Provides an intuitive way to think about the value of a security. A stock or bond is a claim on real future income and assets. 2- Enables us to test the growth and return assumptions of a stock or entire market. In the dot-com boom, the entire Nasdaq sold at 100-times earnings, implying a ridiculously high earnings growth rate or a low expected return. (The latter seemed more plausible and is what eventually happened.) 3- The above formulas can be rearranged to calculate the market's expected return, producing an equation that is stunningly simple and powerful: ### THE GORDON EQUATION: Discount Rate (market return) = Dividend Yield + Dividend Growth An accurate way to predict long-term stock market returns. During the 20th century, the average dividend yield was 4.5% and the compounded rate of dividend growth was also 4.5%. Add the two and you get 9%. The actual return was 9.89%. (The .89% difference was due to the fact that stocks had become considerably more expensive: the dividend yield had fallen.) If the stock market is simply viewed as a source of dividends, then its price should rise in proportion to those dividends. So if the dividends increase at 4.5% per year then over the very long term its price should also increase by 4.5% per year. In addition to the price increase you also receive the actual dividend each year. The total return comes from the combination of the annualized price increase and the average dividend yield. The Gordon Equation is as close to being a physical law, like gravity or planetary motion, as we will ever encounter in finance. It can predict the long-term (30 year) expected return of the market. What does the Gordon Equation tell us about future returns? Dividend growth is 5% and yield is 1.55% = 6.55%. Nowhere near the 10% returns of the past. Bonds will return about 6%. So stocks and bonds should be in the 6% return range. METAPHOR FOR MARKET: a dog-owner walking an excitable dog on a very long leash in one direction. No predictable way to know which way the dog will lurch, but in the long run you know he's heading northeast at an average speed of 3 mph. (What's astonishing is that all the market players have their eye on the dog and not the owner.) The worst possible time to invest is when the skies are clear, because perceived risks are low, causing investors to discount future stock income at a very low rate. This in turn produces high stock prices, which result in low future returns. The saddest part of this story is that ""pie-in-the-sky"" investing is both infectious and emotionally effortless. Everyone else is doing it. In investing, our social instincts are poison. The best possible time to invest is when the sky is black with clouds, because investors discount future stock income at a high rate. This produces low stock prices, which in turn, beget high future returns. ## CH. 3 : The Market is Smarter Than You Are There is no evidence of stock-picking skill among professional money managers, from year to year manager relative performance is nearly random. There is absolutely no evidence that anyone can time the market. ## CH. 4 : The Perfect Portfolio Since you cannot time the market or select individual stocks, asset allocation should be the major focus of your investment strategy, because it is the only factor affecting your investment risk and return that you can control. Past portfolio performance is only weakly predictive of future portfolio behavior. It's a mistake to design your portfolio on the basis of the past decade or two. The most important asset allocation decision is between risky assets (stocks) and riskless assets (short-term bonds, bills, CDs, money market funds). The primary diversifying stock assets are foreign equity (40% max) and REITs (15% max). ## CH. 5 : Tops: A History of Manias There will always be speculative markets in which the old rules seem to go out the window. Learn to recognize the signs: technological or fiancial ""displacement"", excessive use of credit, amnesia for the last bubble, and the flood of new investors who swallow plausible stories in place of doing the hard math. John Templeton: The four most expensive words are ""This time, it's different."" ## CH. 6 : Bottoms: The Agony and Opportunity It's human nature to be influenced by the last 10-20 years' returns. It's hard to imagine that something doing poorly was ever a good investment. When recent returns for a given asset class have been very high or very low, put your faith in the longest data series you can find - not just the recent data. Be able to estimate returns for yourself. Don't underestimate the courage it takes to act on your beliefs. Cheap stocks excite only the dispassionate, the analytical, and the aged. When an entire nation has acted unwisely on bad advice, the rules of the game are likely to change drastically, and that the sources of that advice should beware. What to do during a crash? Don't panic and sell - simply stand pat. Have a firm asset allocation policy in place. What separates the professional from amateur are two things: 1. the knowledge that brutal bear markets are a fact of life and there's no way to avoid their effects 2. when times get tough, the pro stays the course, and the amateur abandons the blueprints (or has no blueprints) Rebalancing - maintaining a constant allocation - is a technique which automatically commands you to sell when the market is euphoric and buy when the market is morose. Ideally, when prices fall dramatically, you should go even further and increase your percentage equity allocation. ## CH. 7 : Misbehavior - herd mentality - overconfidence - recency - need to be entertained - myopic risk aversion - great company / great stock illusion - pattern hallucination - mental accounting - country club syndrome Overconfidence: the compartmentalization of success and failure. We remember those activities where we succeeded and forget those where we didn't. It's more agreeable to ascribe success to skill than luck. For each bit of excitement you derive from an investment, you lose a compensatory amount of return. A portfolio full of dull value stocks (USX, Caterpillar, Ford) is the most likely to have higher returns. Amateurs listen to stories. Serious investors do the math. Imagine two companies: - Smokestack, selling at 20x earnings. - Glamour, selling at 80x earnings. Smokestack: for every $100 of stock, produces $5 of earnings. ($100/20 = $5) Glamour: for every $100 of stock, produces $1.25 of earnings. ($100/80 = $1.25) The market expects Glamour to grow its earnings much more rapidly. If Smokestack grows its earnings at a rate of 6% per year, then after 6 years it will increase its earnings by 48%, from $5/share to $7.40/share. If Glamour grows its earnings by 20% more than the market, 78% (1.48 x 1.20 = 1.78) its earnings will grow from $1.25 per share to $2.23 per share. After that, Glamour will have the same earnings growth as Smokestack, earning $7.40/share. Humans are great at recognizing highly abstract patterns. But in investing, this talent is usually counterproductive. For the most part, the pricing of stocks and bonds at both the individual and market level is random: there are no patterns! In such a chaotic world, the search for patterns is not only futile, it is downright dangerous. There are certainly pieces of data that are predictive of future economic activity. The problem is that everyone knows, watches, and analyzes these statistics, and the results have already been factored into stock and bond prices. Acting on this information is likely to be of no value. Something that everyone knows isn't worth knowing. (- Bernard Baruch) Regret avoidance : holding onto a stock that has done poorly keeps alive the possibility that we will not have to confront the finality of our failure. If you believe the markets are efficient, the performance of a fallen stock should not be any different than a successful one. Stocks that have recently fallen have, on average, higher expected returns than the market. We have met the enemy, and he is us. (- Walt Kelly) ## CH. 8 : Behavioral Therapy An investment that has become a topic of widespread conversation is likely to be overpriced for the simple reason that too many people have already invested in it. (Realestate & gold in 80s, Japanese stocks in late 80s, Tiger nations in 90s, tech stocks in late 90s) In each case, disaster followed. When ""everybody knows"" that something is a good deal, raise the red flags. Identify current conventional wisdom so you can ignore it. Present market environment : everybody knows stocks have high long-term returns. So further prices will be much harder to come by. ## CH. 9 : Your Broker is Not Your Buddy A broker with a clientele full of contented customers is a broker who will soon be looking for a new job. Brokers need *trades* to make money. ## CH. 11 : Oliver Stone Meets Wall Street So who do I turn to for information? The market itself is the best advisor. When you buy the market, you are hiring the aggregate judgement of the most brilliant and well-informed minds in finance. (Wisdom of Crowds) The only real guidance you need is in two areas: - overall asset allocation - self-discipline READING LIST: http://www.efficientfrontier.com/reading.htm Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Burton Malkiel - explains the basics of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, and will reinforce the efficient market concept. Common Sense on Mutual Funds, by John Bogle. The New Finance, the Case Against Efficient Markets, by Robert Haugen. wonder why value investing still works after all these years, this is your book. The prose is breezy, even quirky—Ben Graham meets Hunter Thompson on bad acid. Value Averaging, by Michael Edleson. An extremely useful how-to guide on deploying a lump sum of money among multiple assets. Finally back in print as a Wiley Classic Edition. The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham. Although it has great relevance to the markets in general and should be read by any serious investor, it is particularly pertinent to those who feel compelled to buy individual stocks. Devil Take the Hindmost, by Edward Chancellor. You simply can't learn enough about market history, and Chancellor's story of boom and bust in the capital markets, beginning in the 17th century, is pure mind candy. ## CH. 12 : Will You Have Enough? Young savers should be praying for a bear market, so they can accumulate shares cheaply. Manage all of your assets as one portfolio. Plan on spending, at maximum, the expected real return of your portfolio. (ie: 3%-4% of its value) The most successful prescription for a successful retirement is to get into the habit of curbing your material desires. Now. Do not invest any money in stocks that you will need in less than five years. Have 6 months of living expenses in safe investment vehicles in a taxable account. ## CH. 13 : Defining Your Mix You will not know what kinds of economic, political, or even military adversity will befall your portfolio. If inflation, you would emphasize gold, natural resources, real estate, and cash, as well as a fair amount of stocks. If deflationary depression like 1930s, you'd only hold long-maturity government bonds. If the world lost confidence in U.S. leadership, you'd want a portfolio heavy in foreign stocks and bonds. Since we don't know, own as many asset classes as you can, so you can avoid the catastrophe of holding a portfolio concentrated in the worst ones. Like amateur tennis : bad players hit too hard, out of the court, trying to be tricky. Better off just volleying it back safely. You don't win as much as you avoid losing. The name of the game is not losing. S&P 500 = not the biggest 500, but 500 firms chosen by S&P as representative of the makeup of the U.S. industry. S&P 500 is capitalization-weighted: if GE has $400B market cap and American Greetings has $700M, the index fund would have to own 600 times as much GE as American Greetings. If GE plunges in value, nothing changes. The index doesn't need to buy or sell. S&P 500 holds about 7% of the total number of companies, but they make up 75% of U.S. market cap. Wilshire 5000 = ""total market"" : 7000 stocks Russell 3000 = the 3000 biggest companies. (The remaining 4000 amount to only 1% of US market cap.) The index funds that track Wilshire 5000 or Russell 3000 don't own all stocks in them - just representative sampling of the market. So they don't track the index precisely. Passively managed = owns some but not all. When and where do you own a total-market index fund? In two situations: (1) - an ideal core holding in a taxable account because of its tax efficiency. No turnover. (2) - but not in a retirement account. There, you want to break the U.S. market into separate parts. LUMPERS SAY: because market is ruthlessly efficient, no segments offer superior long-term returns. breaking into subclasses is expensive, distracting, and exposes you to unnecessary risk SPLITTERS SAY: historical data shows value stocks have higher return than growth stocks, and small stocks have higher return than large stocks. it's logical to overweight value and small size. Large Value + Large Growth = Large Market (S&P 500) Small Value + Small Growth = Small Market (Russell 2000 or S&P 600) Since growth stocks have market caps much larger than value stocks, they overwhelm them in most indexes, so growth and market behave nearly identically. How do you draw the line between large and small? Russell 2000 is most common. CSRP 9-10 Decile Index for academics. (DFA tracks?) How do you draw the line between value and growth? Split market by ratio of price-to-book values by thirds. Value=bottom third. Growth=top third. Blend=middle third. Small Growth is a very bad actor in the long term, with the lowest return of the 4 corners and high risk. Use small-market fund in place of small-growth, and large-market fund in place of large-growth. REITs : often behave very differently from the four corners of the market. In sum : the 5 major domestic asset classes you should use are: - large market - small market - large value - small value - REITs Avoid owning the Vanguard Total International Fund in a taxable account, since it's a fund of funds, with 3 regional funds. Not eligible for the foreign dividend tax exclusion, which allows you to deduct the taxes on dividends from foreign stocks on your US tax return. Overriding principle of bond investment : keep it short! Treasuries can be bought at auction directly from the government without a fee. http://www.treasurydirect.gov/ It makes no sense to purchase municipal bonds in a tax-sheltered account. The choice is between government and corporate issues. Split your taxable accounts among all three of the bond classes: municipal, Treasury, corporate. The Treasuries will have a lower after-tax yield, but be safe and liquid, and free from state tax. The yield differences aren't enough to be fretting over. It makes no sense to buy a bond index fund, because 50% is invested in Treasuries which you can own separately without paying fund fees. Buy treasuries directly. A stock fund with no turnover will produce no capital-gains distributions. You'll be taxed only on the relatively small amount of stock dividends the fund passes through to you. REIT and junk-bond funds distribute almost all their return in the form of dividends. These dividends are taxed at the high ordinary income rate. So you will want to hold only tax-efficient funds in your taxable account, reserving the most tax-inefficient ones for your retirement accounts. Value funds are tax-inefficient because if a stock increases in value it must be sold since it no longer qualifies. In tax-sheltered, you're more free to aggressively rebalance the foreign and domestic components. Instead of just owning foreign market, you can break it down into regions. Go flat out for yield in your bond portfolio and not have to worry about taxation until you withdraw cash. The easiest structures to design are those where more than half of assets are tax-sheltered. If you have less than 50% of your assets in sheltered vehicles, you should place value stocks and REITs in them - and break foreign assets into regions (Euro, Pacific, emerging) - to benefit from rebalancing. ## CH. 14 : Getting Started, Keeping It Going Dollar Cost Averaging / ""DCA"" : investing the same amount of money regularly in a given fund or stock. Advantage is lower average price. More shares bought when price is low. Do not underestimate the discipline it takes to carry out a successful DCA program. Even better than DCA is ""Value Averaging"" described by Michael Edleson in his Value Averaging book. Instead of blindly investing $100/month, you draw a value averaging path, with a target amount that increases by the same amount each month. ($100 in this example.) In other words : you aim at having $100 in the account by January, $200 by February.. to $1200 in December year 1, $2400 December year 2, etc. So if the value declines, more than $100 will be required to reach the desired total each month. If the fund goes up, less will be required. (Perhaps none, some months.) But don't sell to rebalance, because of capital gains tax. For bonds, no reason to do this. Invest it all immediately. For the rest, set a value averaging path per-asset-class (per holding). Value averaging should not be done with ETFs, because of the separate fee per-transaction. This is simplified, but Edelson's real method also builds-in further growth into the path. He recommends quarterly, and a minimum of 2-3 years for funding. Rebalancing can raise return by 1%. Rebalancing forces you to buy low, sell high. Bucking conventional wisdom is a profitable activity. Rebalancing forces you to be a contrarian. Financial contrarians tend to be wealthier than folks who like to follow the crowd. How often to rebalance? In a tax-sheltered: every 2-3 years. The tendency for prior best-performers to do worse in the future and vice-versa seems to be strongest over about 2-3 years. Taxable accounts: it makes sense to rebalance only with mandatory fund distributions, inflows, and outflows. ###### (From Money Magazine: http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/06/pf/105769815.moneymag/) Now that you know just how long and rigorous this event really is, how do you train for it? The basic workout is consistent asset allocation. The point isn't to come up with the perfect strategy as much as it is to have one that you'll stick with in up-and-down markets. Then, once a year, rebalance back to those levels. In the good years, this means selling some stocks to get things back into balance, and in the bad years it means selling some bonds to buy more stocks. The latter is harder to do than the former. There's no better way of keeping yourself fit than regular rebalancing, particularly during bear markets. By making it a routine math exercise instead of an annual review of the market or your strategy, you'll find it easier to tune out your emotions. The good news is that unlike an elite athlete, an emotionally fit investor doesn't have to wake up at 6 a.m. every morning to work out (or tune in to CNBC). In fact, it is better not to think about investing most of the time. I know no greater investment pro than Vanguard founder John Bogle; he tells me that he peeks at his holdings only once a year. In this race, the edge goes to the disciplined couch potato.","If you've already read and loved The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read, above, then read this more in-depth book next."
Here Comes Everybody,Clay Shirky,1594201536,6,"Most of the barriers to group action have collapsed, and without those barriers, we are free to explore new ways of gathering together and getting things done. (Story of blogger helping cellphone-theft victim) : Evan was driven, resourceful, and very angry. Had he presented his mission in completely self-interested terms (""Help my friend save $300!"") or in unattainably general ones (""Let's fight theft everywhere!""), the tools he chose wouldn't have mattered. What he did was to work out a message framed in big enough terms to inspire interest, yet achievable enough to inspire confidence. A plausible promise. The costs incurred by creating a new group or joining an existing one have collapsed, not just in money but in time, effort and attention. People respond to incentives. If you give them more of a reason to do something, they will do more of it, and if you make it easier to do more of something they are already inclined to do, they will also do more of it. If you want to organize the work of even dozens of people, you have to manage them. As organizations grow into the hundreds or thousands, you also have to manage the managers. Simply to exist at that size, an organization has to take on the costs of all that management. None of the absolute advantages of institutions like businesses or schools or governments have disappeared. The music industry is still reeling from the discovery that the reproduction and distribution of music, previously a valuable service, is now something their customers can do for themselves. Group action gives society its particular characters, and anything that changes the way groups get things done will affect society as a whole. For any given organization, the important questions are ""When will the change happen?"" and ""What will change?"" The only two answers we can rule out are never and nothing. == Individuals in group settings exhibit behaviors that no one could predict by studying single minds. No one has ever been bashful or extroverted while sitting alone in their room, no one can be a social climber or a man of the people without reference to society, and these characteristics exist because groups are not just simple aggregations of individuals. Typical organization is hierarchical, which vastly simplifies communication among employees. New employees only need one connection, to their boss, to get started. That's much simpler than trying to have everyone talk to everyone. Self-preservation of the institution becomes job number one, while its stated goal is relegated to number two or lower, no matter what the mission statement says. A firm is successful when the costs of directing employee effort are lower than the potential gain from directing. Richard Hackman studied the size and effectiveness of work groups in ""Leading Teams"" (book). What happens to tasks that aren't worth the cost of managerial oversight? Things like the aggregated amateur documentation of the London bombings were simply outside of the realm of possibility. That collection now exists because people have always desired to share, and the obstacles that prevented sharing on a global scale are now gone. These things are valuable to someone but too expensive to be taken on in any institutional way. The loosely affiliated group can accomplish something more effectively than the institution can. Thing of group undertaking as a kind of ladder of activities that are enabled or improved by social tools. The rungs on the ladder, in order of difficulty, are: * - sharing * - cooperation * - collective action. Sharing creates the fewest demands on the participants. Many sharing platforms like Flikr operate in a take-it-or-leave-it fashion, allowing for the maximum freedom of the individual to participate while creating the fewest complications of group life. Cooperating is harder than simply sharing, because it involves changing your behavior to sync with people who are changing their behavior to sync with you. Unlike sharing, where the group is mainly an aggregate of participants, cooperating creates group identity - you know who you are cooperating with. One simple form of cooperation is conversation. When people are in one another's company, they like to talk. Collaborative production is a more involved form of cooperation, as it increases the tension between individual and group goals. The litmus test for is simple : no one person can take credit for what gets created, and the project could not come into being without the participation of many. Collective action is the hardest kind of group effort, requiring a group of people to commit themselves to undertaking a particular effort together, and to do so in a way that makes the decision of the group binding on the individual members. Tragedy of the commons : where individuals have an incentive to damage the collective good. While each person can agree that all would benefit from common restraint, the incentives of the individuals are arrayed against that outcome. This is why taxes are never voluntary - people would opt out of paying for road maintenance. For a group to take collective action, it must have some shared vision strong enough to bind the group together, despite periodic decisions that will inevitably displease at least some members. For this reason collective action is harder to arrange than information sharing or collaborative creation. In the current spread of social tools, real examples of collective action - where a group acts on behalf of, and with shared consequences for, all of its members - are still relatively rare. == For people with a professional outlook, it's hard to understand how something that isn't professionally produced could affect them. Most professions exist because there is a scarce resource that requires ongoing management : librarians are responsible for organizing books on the shelves, newspaper execs are responsible for deciding what goes on the front page. The scarcity of the resource itself creates the need for a professional class. When a profession has been created as a result of some scarcity, as with librarians or TV programmers, the professionals are often the last ones to see it when that scarcity goes away. It's easier to understand that you face competition than obsolescence. The cost of finding like-minded people has been lowered, and more important : deprofessionalized. From now on, news can break into public consciousness without the traditional press weighing in. The news media can end up covering the story *because* something has broken into public consciousness via other means. Blogs are not merely alternate sites of publishing - they are alternatives to publishing itself, in the sense of publishers as a minority and professional class. In the same way you do not have to be a professional driver to drive, you no longer have to be a professional publisher to publish. Because social effects lag behind technological ones by decades, real revolutions don't involve an orderly transition from point A to point B, rather they go from A - through a long period of chaos - and only then reach B. In that chaotic period, the old systems get broken long before new ones become stable. Professional self-conception and self-defense, so valuable in ordinary times, become a disadvantage in revolutionary ones, because professionals are always concerned with threats to the profession. In 2005, a French bus company, Transports Schiocchet Excursions (TSE) sued several French cleaning women who had previously used TSE for transport to their jobs in Luxembourg. The women's crime? Carpooling. TSE asked that the women be fined and that their cars be confiscated, on the grounds that the service the women had arranged to provide for themselves - transportation - should be provided only by commercial services such as TSE. (The case was thrown out in a lower court; it is pending on appeal.) This strategy - suing former customers for organizing themselves - is precisely the one being pursued by the music and movie industries today. Those industries used to perform a service by distributing music and moving images, but laypeople can now move music and video easily, in myriad ways that are both cheaper and more flexible than those mastered and owned by existing commercial firms, like selling CDs and DVDs in stores. Faced with radical new efficiencies, those very firms are working to make moving movies and music harder, in order to stay in business - precisely the outcome that the bus company was arguing for. If everyone can do something, it is no longer rare enough to pay for, even if it is vital. ((about scribes:)) Instead of mass professionalization, the spread of literacy was a process of mass amateurization. The term ""scribe"" didn't get extended to everyone who could read and write. Instead, it simply disappeared, as it no longer denoted a professional class. == Why would anyone (myspace comments, self-absorbed bloggers) put such drivel out in public? It's simple. They're not talking to you. We misread these seemingly inane posts because we're so unused to seeing written material in public that isn't intended for us. We think that everyone is now broadcasting. This is a mistake. If we listened in on other people's phone calls, we'd know to expect small talk, inside jokes, and the like, but people's phone calls aren't out in the open. Fame is simply an inbalance between inbound and outbound attention, more arrows pointing in than out. Two things have to happen for someone to be famous: (1) scale: an audience in the thousands or more (2) to be unable to reciprocate Famous means being the recipient of more attention than you can return in any medium. In the blog world there are no authorities, only masses, and yet the accumulated weight of attention continues to create the kind of imbalances we associate with traditional media. The downside of fame : being unable to reciprocate in the way our friends and colleagues would like us to. When we call something intuitive, we often mean familiar. Simply to remain viable, anyone producing traditional media has to decide what to produce and what not to; the good work has to be sorted from the mediocre in advance of publication. Since the basic economics of publishing puts a cap on the overall volume of content, it also forces every publisher or producer to filter the material in advance. Every instance of the written word comes with an implicit promise : someone besides the writer thought this was worth reading. ""Published"" : The label is a way of assuring people that some external filter has been applied to the work. The converse of this effect explains our skepticism about self-published books and the label reserved for publishers who print such books - the vanity press. Publishing makes mass amateurization of filtering a forced move. Filter-then-publish rested on a scarcity of media that is a thing of the past. The only working system is publish-then-filter. Conversation is king. Content is just something to talk about. The conversation that forms around shared photos, videos, blog posts, and the like is often about how to do it better next time - how to be a better photographer or a better writer or a better programmer. The goal of getting better at something is different from the goal of being good at it. There is a pleasure in improving your abilities even if that doesn't translate into absolute perfection. By providing an opportunity for the visible display of expertise or talent, the public asking of questions creates a motivation to answer in public as well, and that answer, once perfected, persists even if both the original asker and answerer lose interest. With a billion people online, it's easy and cheap to get the attention of a million people, or more important, help those people get one another's attention. People like to consume media, but they also like to produce it (""Look what I made!"") and share it (""Look what I found!""). Communications tools don't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring. The hallmark of revolution is that the goals of the revolutionaries cannot be contained by the institutional structure of the existing society. == Wikipedia: Something this big seems like it should require managers, a formal work-flow process. How (else) could it possibly work? Spontaneous division of labor. Someone decides an article should exist and creates it. That article's creator doesn't need to know everything. Some add new text, some edit. None of these people need to know everything. For a Wikipedia article to improve, the good edits simply have to outweigh the bad ones. There is simply no commercially viable way to let employees work on what interest them as the mood strikes. There is, however, a noncommercial way to do so, which involves being effective without worrying about being efficient. This is what befell Nupedia : because everyone working on that project understood that only experts were to write articles, no one would even begin an article they knew little about. Imbalance drives large social systems rather than damaging them. Only 2% of users ever contribute, yet that is enough to create profound value for millions of users. Most large social experiments are engines for harnessing inequality rather than limiting it. Any measure of ""average"" participation becomes meaningless. There is a steep decline from a few wildly active participants to a large group of barely-active participants. By definition, most participants are below average. Economist's joke : Bill Gates walks into a bar, and suddenly everyone inside becomes a millionaire, on average. (Flip side : everyone in the bar now has a below-average income.) On Wikipedia, where there is no representative user, the habits of mind that come from thinking about averages are not merely useless, they're harmful. Instead, you have to change your focus to concentrate not on the individual users but on the behavior of the collective. Once writers start getting more attention than they can return, they are forced into a width-versus-depth tradeoff. They can spend less time talking to everyone. (It's no accident we call these interactions shallow, and say that people who have them are strateched thin.) Alternatively, they can limit themselves to deeper interactions with a few people (in which case we call them cliquish or standoffish). At the extremes, they are forced to adopt both strategies, to limit both the number and the depth of interactions. A wedding reception is a localized version of this tradeoff. The bride and groom gather a room full of people they could talk to for hours, then talk to most of the guests for just a few minutes each so as not to be rude. The coming change in group effort is on the ability to make nonfinancial motivations add up to something of global significance. AOL's friendliness came from AOL's users, many of whom loved the service so much they worked as volunteer guides. Evidence that enough people care about an article, and that they have both the will and tools to quickly defend it, has proven enough to demoralize most vandals. Let the community do as much as they possibly can, but where they can't do the work on their own, add technological fixes. == Revolution doesn't happen when society adopts new technologies - it happens when society adopts new behaviors. == Social awareness has 3 levels: 1. when everybody knows something 2. when everybody knows that everybody knows 3. when everybody knows that everybody knows that everybody knows Now the highly motivated people can create a context more easily in which the barely motivated people can be effective without having to become activists themselves. == The shadow of the future makes it possible for me to act on your behalf today, even at some risk or cost to me, on the expectation that you will remember and reciprocate tomorrow. First, much of the success of the US as a nation has had to do with its ability to generate social capital, that mysterious but critical set of characteristics of functioning communities. When your neighbor walks your dog while you are ill, or the guy behind the counter trusts you to pay him next time, social capital is at work. It is the shadow of the future on a societal scale. Individuals in groups with more social capital (more habits of cooperation) are better off than those in groups with less social capital. Anyone who predicts the death of cities has already met their spouse. Meetup.com is most appealing to people who share some philosophical outlook but have no support from the broader culture. (There are many more presbyterians than pagans but they have less of a need to meet up in this way because they have less transaction costs than pagans, who have no culturally normal place and time to meet and no ready way to broadcast their interests without censure.) Meetups are also popular with fans of cultural icons whose work is quirky enough that those fans want to be in one another's presence. (Two people who like fencing are likelier to be friends than two people who like football.) Our new freedoms are not without problems. It's not a revolution if nobody loses. Most obvious loss is to people whose jobs relied on solving a formerly hard problem. The spread of cheap and widely available creative tools is sad for people in the advertising business in the same way that movable type was sad for scribes - the loss from this kind of change is real but limited, and is accompanied by a generally beneficial social change. == As the size of your network grows, your small-group pattern, where everyone connected to everyone, would first become impractical, then unbuildable. Let the small groups connect tightly, and then you connect the groups. But you can't really connect groups - you connect people within groups. Instead of one loose group of 25, you have 5 tight groups of 5. As long as a couple people in each small group know a couple people in other groups, you get the advantages of tight connection at the small scale and loose connection at the large scale. The network will be sparse, but efficient and robust. Tie several few-person networks together into a network of networks. It's not how many people you know - it's how many kinds. == A service business does best not by trying to do things on behalf of its users, but by providing a platform for them to do things for one another. Failure is free, high-quality research, offering direct evidence of what works and what doesn't. With low-enough barriers to participate, people are not just willing but eager to join together to try things, even if most of those things end up not working. Linux got to be world-changingly good, not by promising to be great or by bringing paid developers together under the direction of some master plan, but by getting incrementally better, through voluntary contributions, one version at a time. Linus said, “I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them.” This kind of openness is thekey to any project relying on peer production. The number of people who are willing to start something is MUCH smaller than the number of people willing to contribute once someone else starts something. Open systems lower the cost of failure. They do not create biases in favor of predictable but substandard outcomes, and they make it simpler to integrate the contributions of people who contribute only a single idea. The overall effect of failure is its likelihood times its cost. Most organizations attempt to reduce the effect of failure by reducing its likelihood. Open source doesn't reduce the likelihood of failure, but it does reduce its cost. Cheap failure, valueable as it is on its own, is also a key part of a more complex advantage : the exploration of multiple possibilities. The resources invested in trying these actions will often cost more than the outcome. This in turn means there are many actions that might pay off but won't be tried, even for innovative firms, because their eventual success is not predictable enough. It is this gap that distribution exploration takes advantage of : in a world where anyone can try anything, even the risky stuff can be tried eventually. If enough people are trying things, the happy accidents have a much higher chance of being discovered. == Every story in this book relies on a successful fusion of: + a plausible promise + an effective tool + an acceptable bargain with the users The promise is the basic ""why"" for anyone to join or contribute to a group. The tool helps with the ""how"", for the difficulties of coordination. The bargain sets the rules of the road: if you are interested in the promise and adopt the tools, what can you expect and what will be expected of you? Any new claim on someone's time must obviously offer some value, but more important, it must offer some value higher than something else she already does, or she won't free up the time. The promise has to hit a sweet spot among several extremes. Voice of the Faithful was neither too mundane (""let's blow off steam about abusive priests"") nor too disprespectful (""let's demolish the church""). Linux was neither too provisional (""let's try to see if we can come up with something together"") nor too sweeping (""let's create a world-changing operating system""). Modest but interesting. The problem of getting the promise right is unlike traditional marketing, because most marketing involves selling something that will be made for the listeners rather than by them. (""Buy Cheesy Poofs"" is a different message from ""Join us and let's invent Cheesy Poofs together""). You need to convince individuals not just that they will find the group satisfying and effective but that others will find it so as well. Founder of Flickr said, ""You have to greet the first 10,000 users personally."" This let the early users feel what it would be like to have an appreciative public, even before such a public existed. Bargain helps clarify what you can expect of others and what they can expect of you. Wikipedia arms its users with ways to help enforce the bargains that make the site work. Communal bike programs that have succeeded have placed restrictions on the use of the bicycles with things like locked sheds and ID cards for checking them in and out. (Given the opportunity to misbehave and little penalty for doing so, enough people's behavior becomes antisocial enough to wreck things for everyone.) No effort at creating group value can be successful without some form of governance. People are basically good, when they are in circumstances that reward goodness while restraining impulses to defect.","Like Wikinomics and Crowdsourcing, required reading if interested in harnessing the collective power of people online."
The Culting of Brands,Douglas Atkin,1591840961,6,"Cult paradox: 1. An individual has feeling of difference - even alienation, from the world around them. 2. This leads to openness to or searching for a more compatible environment 3. They're likely to feel a sense of security or safety in a place where one's difference from the outside world is seen as a virtue, not handicap 4. This presents circumstances for self-actualization within a group of like-minded others who celebrate the individual for being himself Cults flatter you : make you feel special and individual, recognized for who you really are. Cults need to separate themselves from the status quo. To create a mutual sense of separation: 1. determine your organization's sense of difference 2. declare your own difference with doctrine and language. 3. demarcate yourself from the outside world 4. demonize the other clearly declare your removal from the status quo. declaring what you believe means declaring what you do not. passionate commitment is in proportion to the strength of the vision and ideas in the theology. members want to commit to something. daily acts of demarcation : these are the things that immediately separate the cult and its followers from the rest of society. proper use of ritual, iconography, symbols, rules, texts, language, and appearance. identifying an enemy and dramatizing a threat will galvanize the community's sense of separation, unity, identity. condemn the other as a photographic negative of self. Nike brand of self-achievement demonizes ""not doing it"". For real commitment, members need to feel they have a relationship with ""an other"" or ""others"". Buy-in to ideology or benefits comes later. ""I liked it a lot because I liked the people."" 1. Focus on the person 2. Get the right membership. (Well-socialized people who will engage new prospects.) 3. Create opportunities for meeting and interaction between members and nonmembers. 4. Let reps focus on interaction. Remove distractions. 5. Love-bomb new members. jetBlue : it was a failure of the person that sowed a growing hatred between airlines and customers. jetBlue : we want to ""remove ourselves from the category"" jetBlue business model was ""brilliant in its heresy"" management fixated on how jetBlue personnel would bond with the customer. Populate the INTERNAL CULT with the right kind of membership and motivate them to perform, then you'll recruit the right kind of membership externally and turn them into advocates. Create myths and stories that carry the moral for you. (jetBlue example of pilot that came into the cabin and gave his cellphone to anyone who needed it, as apology for being late, not his fault.) Socially successful peiople populate successful cults. Recruit socially attractive people. The cult doesn't want losers. Get the best staff to recruit others like themselves. Increase opportunities for people to meet and engage. Let go : don't force your members to sell the brand. Don't burden staff with too many tasks. jetBlue : passengers are asked to help clear their seat for the next passenger. brilliant move that frees up time for the attendants to be more social and helpful. The idea of belonging is such an underestimated principle in marketing. We've gone too far with one-to-one marketing : seeing customers as isolated individuals. Community marketing : cultivating, serving, infusing brands into communities. Marketers should be obsessed with communities, not just fret about how to market to an impossible number of individuals. Communities : the human race demands them, needs them. Belonging is fundamental. We need to talk to others to know what we think : ""The subjective reality of the world hangs on the thin thread of conversation."" In the face of terrifying chaos, a craving need to make sense of it all. Each member reinforces the believability of an interpretation to the other. People have less time to spare : do not wish to commit themselves to organizations that have large obscure objectives. The more cult members are around each other, the stickier the bond. Have a rigorously applied program of contact. Keep tabs on membership and prospects, placing extra focus on recent recruits. Database constantly updated. Don't let anyone disappear. The membership runs the program themselves. Not corporation to customer, but customer to customer. A big difference. A sense of responsibility among members for the welfare of each other and the group as a whole. (a critical indicator of the strength of a community) Create a self-sufficient world of contact and care. BMW club refers to all members as ""president""s, in recognition they own the brand. Membership must share experiences. Members feel an obligation to each other and the group as a whole. Critically important is whether the cult feels an equal sense of responsibility toward its members. Is their investment reciprocated? Pre-dispose a culture towards mutuality. Responsibility can be embedded as an idea within the doctrine and its codes of behavior. Everything anyone does in our organization does to succeed is based upon helping others. (sales team helping customers. managers helping employees.) The company structure requires each person to help others in order to climb the ladder of success. Must have a meaning system. Sort and repaint the world into a picture of how it should be. There are dangers to including real people in the symbolic system. For all the benefits of belonging, the member has paid a price. If that commitment is not matched by an equivalent reward, including the feeling that the leadership is as committed and has paid an equal price, then the results can be disasterous for the cult. Organizations rot from everyday organizational intertia: Minor concessions, group think. Every time a limp idea is chosen for expediency, every time a mediocre message is approved out of fear, every time vision and care is subsumed by mechanism and compromise, you'll find an institution slowly rotting at the core and alienating its fans. Apple : ""Marketing is about values. We have to be very clear on what we want our customers to know about us. Cult leaders can be more successful if humble. Focus acquisition investment on the conservative majority, those who are slow to adopt the new, but when they do are slow to leave it. The most effective way of finding new people is personal referral. An explicit appeal for trust in the face of newness. Returning to already accepted values. At one extreme, a cult can be so offensive that society can not tolerate it. Other times, cult might be so tame it becomes indistinguishable from its surroundings, making it irrelevant. If you neglect to properly manage this tension, your cult will die! People say, ""Teach me how to get this cultlike enthusiasm for my project."" We'd say, ""Well - what do you believe in?"" They'd say, ""Whatever we need to believe in to do it."" We'd say, ""If that's your attitide, you'll never make it."" Ensure there is a cult within the organization, not just among its members. Cult destroyers : a lack of percieved mutual investment, decline of internal cult that sustained the ideology, and too much tension. Ownership must be shared with its membership for it to thrive. Consumers are demanding a greater role in the shaping of their own community. A member who feels they have helped model the brand will likely be an evangelist for it. Consider your service from the perspective of its ""linking"" value to a community rather than its ""use"" value. Marketers need to ask how their brand can best support a community, versus simply how the product is delivered and used by individuals. Be ever so humble, for that is the way to gain lasting allegiance from your customer group. No decision is made entirely rationally. Emotional disposition towards brand can give an advantage wven when the product is out-featured or out-priced by competitors. Become more dependent on emotional ties.",Unique fascinating dissection of cults and why they work. Then how to apply those lessons to marketing your business.
Maximum Achievement,Brian Tracy,0684803313,6,"You can't hit a target you can't see. Think through what my goal would look like when it was accomplished. Decide exactly what ""success"" means to you - what your life would look like if you made it into a masterpiece. Peace of mind is your highest internal gyroscope. When you're living in harmony with your highest values - when you are perfectly balanced in life - then you enjoy peace of mind. If you compromise your values or go against your inner guidance, your peace of mind is the first thing to suffer. You experience happiness and peace of mind when you are completely free from the destructive emotions of fear, anger, doubt, guilt, resentment, and worry. The key to happiness is to eliminate the parts of your life that cause you negativity or stress of any kind. When you set peace of mind as your goal and plan everything you do in terms of whether it helps or hinders your attainment of that goal, you'll probably never make another mistake. What is your ideal relationship? Who would it be with and what would it look like? What would you want more of? Less of? Examine your relationships, one by one, and develop a plan to make each of them more enjoyable and satisfying. To be truly happy, you need a clear sense of direction. Happiness is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal. Think about what activities and accomplishments you most enjoy. What were you doing in the past when you were the happiest? What sort of activities give you your greatest sense of meaning and purpose in life? Moving toward the realization of your full potential as a human being. Self-actualization. To be good at something, you have to study it thoroughly and practice it diligently. 3 basic operating principles : 1. Life is hard, for everyone. 2. Everything you are or ever will be is up to you. You are where you are today because that is where you have chosen to be. 3. You can learn anything you need to learn to become anyone you want to become, to achieve anything you want to achieve. You are locked in place at your current level of skill and knowledge. You can go no further with what you know now. Your future largely depends on what you learn and practice from this moment onward. If all it took to live a wonderful life was books and ideas, we'd all be rich and happy. You have to have a system. You can't seriously try to master any complex subject without learning everything possible from those who had gone before. Anything you could ever want to be, have, or do, is amenable to learning and hard work. Your main job, in taking control of your life and future, is to become the conductor of your own orchestra. When your life is going well, it means your thoughts and activities are aligned and in harmony with these invisible mental laws. When you are having problems of any kind, it's because you are violating one or more of these laws, whether you know about them or not. You feel positive about yourself to the degree to which you feel you are in control of your own life. If you feel your life is controlled by your debts, boss, health, relationship, or the behavior of others, you will suffer stress. It all begins with you taking control of your thinking. There are two ways you can get control of any situation causing you stress or unhappiness : (1) take action; move forward and do something to change it. Assert yourself in the situation and make it different somehow. (2) simply walk away. It's so important for you to be decisive - to know exactly what you want. There are specific causes for happiness and unhappiness. Whatever you want more of, trace it back to the causes and repeat the causes. What you want to eliminate, trace it back to the causes and get rid of them. Thoughts are causes and effects. Your thoughts are the primary causes of the conditions of your life. Everything in your experience has begun with a thought of some kind - yours or someone else's. People generally have two ways of looking at the world: Benevolent world view: the world is a pretty good place to live, primarily optimistic. Malevolent world view: negative and pessimistic, beliefs like ""no matter how hard you work, you can't get ahead anyway because the deck is stacked against you"". sees injustice, oppression, and misfortune everywhere. Blame things on bad luck and bad people. We too easily accept that we are limited in some way. What you get is not what you want in life, but what you expect. The most consistently effective and predictable motivational behavior you can use is to confidently and constantly expect the best from others. Inverse paranoid : someone who believes the world is conspiring to do him good. Sees every situation as being heaven-sent to teach some valuable lesson or make him successful. This is the most outwardly identifiable quality of a high-performing person. You can never rise any higher than your expectations of yourself. Always expect the best of yourself. Many people hold themselves back because they don't know how to get from where they are to where they want to go. You don't need the answers before you begin. As long as you're clear about what you want and the kind of people you want to be associated with, you'll draw them into your life. Your thoughts' energy is their level of emotional intensity. The more excited or scared you are, the most your thoughts radiate out from you and attract similar people and situations back into your life. Happy people seem to attract other happy pleasant people. A person with a prosperity consciousness seems to attract money-making ideas and opportunities. Optimistic enthusiastic salespeople attract bigger and better customers. Positive businesspeople attract the resources, customers, suppliers and bankers they need to build successful businesses. You can have more, be more, do more, because you can change the person you are. You can change your dominant thoughts by exercising rigorous mental mastery. You can discipline yourself by keeping your thoughts on what you want and refusing to think about what you don't want. People who do this are often called lucky. :-) One must BE something in order to DO something. Your attitude is one of the best indicators of the person you really are inside. The only way you can tell what kind of attitude you really have is by observing how you react when things go wrong. You are as effective as you believe yourself to be in whatever you do. If you earn more than 10% above or below what you feel you are worth, you will feel very uncomfortable. You will immediately begin engaging in compensatory behavior. If you earn 10% too much, you will begin to spend the money, lend it, invest it in things you know nothing about, or even give it away or lose it. Such ""throw-away"" behavior is practiced by anyone who suddenly finds himself with more money than is consistent with his self-concept. If you earn 10% below your self-concept level of income, you begin to scramble : think more creatively, work longer and harder, look at 2nd-income opportunities, think about changing jobs in order to get your income back up into your self-concept range. Where money, weight, or anything else is concerned, you gradually get yourself into your various ""comfort zones"", and once there you do everything possible to stay there. You resist change of any kind, even positive change. The comfort zone is the great enemy of human potential. Any habit persisted in over time becomes a rut. Then, instead of using your intelligence to get out of your rut, you use most of your energies making your rut more comfortable. You justify and rationalize your situation as being unchangeable. You feel and say, ""There's nothing I can do."" Your self-ideal is a combination of the qualities and attributes that you admire most in other people. Exceptional people have very clear self-ideas, toward which they are constantly striving. They set high standards for themselves and strive to live up to them. You always behave consistently with the picture that you hold of yourself on the inside. Self-image modification is one of the fastest and most dependable ways to improve your performance. Destructive criticism makes the person feel incompetent and inadequate, angry and defensive, wanting to strike back or escape. Often people mistakenly think they are giving constructive criticism when they are really just tearing the other person down, and calling it constructive to rationalize their behavior. True constructive criticism leaves the person feeling better and more capable of doing a better job in the future. If criticism doesn't improve performance, by increasing a person's feelings of self-esteem and self-efficacy, then it has merely been a destructive act of self-expression. Destructive criticism lies at the root of many personality problems, hostility, broken spirits, demoralization, anger, resentment, self-doubt, and a host of negative emotions. Some people accept criticism of themselves unquestioningly as if they were actually true. Some people do things poorly the first time and conclude they have no aptitude in that area. Ask yourself, ""What if I had the capacity to be really good in that area?"" Then, assume that you do have the ability, and get to work on yourself. Fear of rejection is the second major reason for failure and underachievement in adult life. Confidence in yourself to consider the opinions of others, then make your own decision based on what you feel is right for you. In each situation in which the opinion of others are involved, ask yourself, ""What do I really want to do? What would make me the happiest?"" Then make your decisions for the person who is going to have to live with them : you. -- BUSINESS: Productive profitable companies are ones where people feel good about themselves. Safe and happy at work. They may be busy, or even frantic with activity, but they are at peace inside. People laugh and joke together. They enjoy one another and their work. They function smoothly and happily as teams. They are more optimistic, more open to new ideas, more creative and more flexible. People are the business. The most important single responsibility of the executive is to ensure harmony and happiness among the people - to create a climate of optimism, enthusiasm, and high morale. Morale. Culture. The general psychological tone of the organization. How happy the individuals are as part of the larger group. How proud and confident they feel, or don't feel, in their membership in the greater entity. The self-concept of a business: self-ideal = a combination of the vision, values, ethics and mission. when these are clear and positive and committed-to by top management, the people in the company are happier, more positive, more confident about themselves and where they're going. Clearly articulate this self-ideal, embody their values in their behavior toward others. Collective self-image : the way the company's management and employees see themselves and think about themselves, determined by how well they fell they are doing. Companies whose sales are up, whose market share is growing, whose profits are respectable, everyone seems happy, outgoing, and confident. Keep people's spirits up by continually telling them how good they are. Everyone looks upward for guidance on how to interpret what's happening. Exec's job to keep morale high by putting the best possible spin on events and keeping people focused on the possibilities of the future, rather than the problems of the past. -- Keep your mind on only the things you want, and off of the things you don't want. To achieve different results, you must become a different person. It's your unconscious striving to remain consistent with what you've said and done in the past that holds you back. You tend to move back toward what you're comfortable doing, and away from things that are new and challenging. When you start thinking about how you are going to accomplish something you want, and you simultaneously refuse to consider whether it's possible or not, your entire mentality begins to change. Most of the suggestions in your environment tend to be negative. Media full of negative sensationalism. Conversations filled with complaining. Most people in the habit of ""ain't it awful"" thinking. Negative and critical. Shakespeare : ""There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."" Changing habits that are no longer consistent with your higher purposes is one of the hardest things you'll ever do and one of the most essential. (Story:) the new president was on the verge of letting the exec go, when he decided to change his thinking. He deliberately chose to reinterpret the behaviors of the exec in a favorable way. He then re-examined the man's past actions in this new light. Everything you do is based on an emotion of some kind. You can't want something for someone else, just as you can't set goals for someone else. It requires desire on the part of the person who expects to change, or it won't take place. You must be willing to let go of the old person in order to become the new person. You must be willing to stop doing certain things in order to start doing the things that are consistent with the new you. You must be willing to make efforts : to persevere for a long time without much evidence of progress. Use visualization to flood your mind at every opportunity with pictures of your ideal life. Teach others what you are learning. You become what you teach. You teach what you are. When you attempt to articulate and explain a new concept to someone else, you understand it and internalize it better yourself. You only really know something to the degree to which you can teach it to someone else, and have them understand and apply it in their own lives. Launch your new habits strongly. Never allow exceptions until the new habit is locked in. (BAD:) Like most people, I slipped into reactive-responsive mode : I took whatever job came along. I associated with whoever happened to be around. Instead of planning my life, I just reacted to my external environment and responded to my emotional and physical needs. Always stretch yourself, push yourself out of your comfort zone. If you aren't willing to face feeling clumsy and inadequate initially, you will get stuck at a low level of achievement. Your biggest battle is with yourself and your biggest challenge is breaking free of your old habitual ways of thinking and acting. Any thought you accept as true in your conscious mind will be accepted without question by your subconscious mind. Your subconscious will immediately begin working to bring it into your reality. When you begin thinking of a new goal, your subconscious takes this new thought as a command, adjusting your words and actions so they are more consistent with your achieving it. CONCENTRATION: Successful happy people are those who have developed the ability to concentrate single-mindedly on one thing, and to stay with it until it's complete. More is less: you can't work on several things at once and end up doing any of them particularly well. I stopped every activity except for the one or two that were most important to me. SUBSTITUTION: Your conscious mind can only hold one thought at a time. Deliberately replace a negative thought with a positive thought. Fastest way to do this is to stop talking and thinking about the problem, and start talking and thinking about the solution. When you think about what you can do, what action you can take, rather than dwelling on what's happened, your mind becomes calm and clear in an instant. Just as feelings generate actions, actions generate feelings. You can act your way into feeling, and the feeling will generate the actions consistent with it. Either one can create the other. If you can hold the feeling or emotion that you would experience if you accomplished a goal, that feeling will create the result that goes with it. The more you relax or ""don't try"", the faster the thought seems to be accepted by your subconscious and the faster the physical result of the thought or goal appears in your world. - verbalize and affirm your desired outcome - visualize and clearly see the outcome - emotionalize it by creating the feeling : imagine yourself already there - release the situation completely, as if someone you trust said they'd take care of it. you don't need to think about it ever again. The manifestation is in direct proportion to how much you've completely released all concern for the outcome, and turned your mind to other things. SELF-HYPNOSIS: For each breath: ""My left arm is becoming heavy and warm."" = 6 times ""My left arm is now heavy and warm."" = 6 times ""My left arm is completely heavy and warm."" = 6 times Do that for each limb, chest, head, neck. When done, you'll be in deep relaxation, alpha state, ready for deep programming. Use it to accelerate development of motor skills. A form of mental rehearsal : practice the movements over & over in your imagination, visualizing perfect performance every time, programming that into subconscious mind. Georgi Lozanov: Best learning takes place when both right brain and left brain are working together. In beta (normal) brain functions at 14 waves/second. In alpha, relaxed/meditative state, brain functions at 8-13 waves/second. Alpha is the ideal brain wave level for learning. Lozanov discovered that if you put a person into state of deep relaxation, then present new information while gentle classical music plays in backgronund, right and left brains synchronize and learning takes place at a rapid rate. In 1979, Lozanov was able to teach a special class 3000 new words, the equivalent of fluency in a foreign language, in a single day. 6 months later, students could still recall 60% of what they learned, compared with the usual university retention of 10%. Most people spend their lives in a form of sleep. They go busily about their daily activities almost totally preoccupied by a continuous stream of disorganized thought. To become all you can be, you must live more consciously. GOALS: Success equals goals, and all else is commentary. Don't be ""a wandering generality rather than a meaningful specific"". You accomplish almost any goal you set for yourself, as long as the goal is clear and you persist long enough. If your goal is to get through the day and watch TV, you will achieve it. If your goal is to be fit and healthy and live a long life, you will achieve that too. If your goal is to be financially independent and wealthy, then there is nothing that can stop you from achieving it, sooner or later. Your only limitation is your desire : how badly do you want it? Your failure mechanism is your natural tendency to follow the path of least resistance, your impulse toward immediate gratification with little or no concern for the long-term consequences of your actions. Your success mechanism is triggered by a goal. The bigger your goal and the more intensely you desire it, the more likely you will be to exert your powers of self-discipline and willpower, and the more capable you will be of making yourself do the things you need to do to get where you want to go. After 50 years of training 20k people, Elmer Letterman concluded the one quality that was most predictive of success : the ""intensity of purpose"". Taking any two people with the same relative levels of intelligence, background, education, and experience, the one with the greater intensity of purpose will always win out over the other. When you have paid the price, success will happen by law, not chance. The single greatest enemy of your potential for greater success and achievement is your comfort zone, your tendency to get stuck in a rut and then to resist all change, even positive change, that would force you out of it. No one fears a change that represents an improvement. Opportunity is usually disguised as hard work. To maintain proper balance, you need 2-3 goals in each area (personal, health, intellectual, career, financial, spiritual). Make your life one continuous stream of progress and achievement. GOALS: - must be in harmony with one another - must be challenging - have both tangible and intangible, both qualitative and quantitative - need short-term and long-term goals (short term = 90 days) + What are your 5 more important values in life? (afterwards, order them in priority) + What are your 3 most important goals in life, now? (30 seconds to answer, tops) + What would you do if you learned you had 6 months to live? + What would you do if you won a million dollars, tax free, in the lottery tomorrow? + What have you always wanted to do, but been afraid to attempt? + What do you most enjoy doing? What gives greatest feeling of self-esteem & personal satisfaction? + What you do if you knew you could not fail? Whatever I write for all of those, I have to do. ""The goal of $400,000 was much more than I could believe, so my subconscious mind simply refused to accept it as a possibility."" Completely unrealistic goals are a form of self-delusion. There are no unrealistic goals - only unrealistic deadlines. Do I want it badly enough, and am I willing to pay the price? A young man went to Socrates and asked how he could gain wisdom. Socrates walked the young man into a nearby lake. When the water was a few feet deep, Socrates suddly grabbed the young man and pushed his head under water and held it there. At first the young man thought it was a joke, but as he was held under longer and longer, he became frantic. He struggled desperately to get free and his lungs burned for lack of oxygen. Finally Socrates let him up, coughing and gasping for air. Socrates then said, ""When you desire wisdom with the same intensity that you desired to breathe, nothing will stop you from getting it."" It's the same with your goals. The most successful people in our society are those who have helped the greatest number of other people to get what they want. Many people launch themselves towards a goal, then allow themselves to slow and stop. Once they stop, getting going again is so difficult they can't do it. Don't let this happen to you. The maintenance of momentum, once you've begun, is essential. To keep yourself positive and motivated, you must be contintually taking actions consistent with what you hope to achieve. When you become fully attuned to your superconscious mind, you will experience a continuous stream of health, energy and strength that will enable you to produce more in a few hours than the average person produces in a week. You will enter the state of ""flow"" where the world seems to slow down while your mind speeds up. During this time you have an easy ability to produce large quantities of high-quality work. You have a wonderful sense of well-being. Your mind sparkles with a stream of ideas that flow to you exactly as you need them. When you stop waffling and make a firm clear decision you are going to do something, no matter what the cost, everything suddenly starts to work in your favor. ""Whenever you find something getting done, anywhere, you will find a monomaniac with a mission."" - Peter Drucker You can never permanently achieve anything on the outside that you are not fully prepared for on the inside. If you achieve anything without preparing yourself for it in your thinking, you will not be able to hold on to it. If you make a lot of money unexpectedly and your self-concept is not equal to it, you will be subconsciously driven to engage in behavior to get rid of the money. That's why it's said, ""Easy come, easy go."" People who experience serendipity all seem to have one thing in common : they are actively seeking something. They have clear goals and the remarkable things they find are all associated with something they want to accomplish. Your superconscious mind operates best under two conditions: The first is when your conscious mind is concentrating 100% on a specific goal. The second is when your conscious mind is busy with something else altogether. You should try both methods on anything you want to accomplish. 1. Define the goal clearly. What exactly do you want to achieve? Exactly what is the problem you want to solve? 2. Gather as much info as you can. 3. Try to solve the problem by reviewing all the info. 4. If you still haven't solved it consciously, turn it over to your superconscious mind. Release it. 5. Get your conscious mind busy elsewhere. Any thought held continuously in your conscious mind must be brought into reality by your superconscious mind, whether positive or negative. How to stimulate the superconscious: OPTIONS: #1 : think about your goals all the time. #2 : solitude. sit still for an hour, doing nothing. At a certain point, you will feel a river of creative energy flowing through you. You will start to have ideas and insights you can apply immediately to be happier and more effective. The answer you need will emerge in your mind. #3 : visualize your goal as realized One good superconscious insight or idea can save you months of hard work. The primary source of innovation in business is the unexpected success or the unexpected failure. The unanticipated event contains the superconscious solution you're seeking. A superconcious solution: - comes 100% complete - appears to be a blinding flash of the obvious - comes accompanies by a burst of joy and energy -- You need to be a skilled thinker to fulfill your potential. Direct relationship between how much responsibility you are willing to accept for results, and how high you rise. Responsibility without excuses, for achieving the goals and objectives of your organization. An employer has two people working for him: one that treats the company as if it belongs to him, another who treated it as just a job. Which is more likely to be promoted? Invested in? Given additional training? You become what you teach. Feelings of inadequacy are often expressed in the words, ""I'm not good enough."" Fear of success is another way of saying that, because of your deep feelings of unworthiness, any achievement that contradicts your self-limiting beliefs make you feel uncomfortable. Most common manifestation of guilt is the victim complex: always making excuses or apologizing. ""I can't"" or ""I have to"" or ""trying"". When people say ""I'll try"", they are apologizing for failure in advance. They are announcing they are going to fail in whatever they say they will try to do. You know these words are signals for upcoming failure. When a supplier says they'll ""try"" to get something to you on time, alarm bells should go off. That supplier is planning to fail. When people say ""I wish"", they don't really believe it. ""I wish I could save money"" or ""I wish I could lose weight"" means ""... but I don't believe it's possible."" Eliminate victim language. Worry is a sustained form of fear caused by indecision. The only real antidote for worry is purposeful action. Incomplete action is a major source of stress and negativity. We all have a compulsion to closure. We feel happy and content when we finish a job, achieve a goal. Begin the task and stay with it until it is complete. It requires tremendous self-discipline, but the payoff is immediate increase of energy, enthusiasm, self-esteem.",A classic self-help book. Exactly what you'd expect. I don't agree with all of it.
Consider This,Chuck Palahniuk,1538717972,5,"Bring out a new book every year. Never go longer than sixteen months without something new because after sixteen months people quit asking if you have another book yet. How people talk: Description combined with occasional instruction, and punctuated with sound effects or exclamations. (So write like people talk.) Andy Warhol's motto of his life was “So what?” No matter what happened, good or bad, he could dismiss the event by thinking, So what? Writers write because they weren’t invited to a party. So bear in mind that the reader is also alone. Consider creating a “template” chapter. Using one existing chapter, change minor details and make it arrive at a fresh epiphany. Chances are the reader won’t realize what you’ve done, but will unconsciously recognize the repeated structure. Use this template to create three chapters placed equal distances apart in the book. So many successful plots begin at the family plot, because for most of us - especially among young people - our worst fear is of losing our parents. If you create a world where one or both parents have died, you’re creating characters that have survived your reader’s worst fears. Your reader will respect them from the get-go. A dead parent bonds the surviving family in ways your reader would like to be bonded with his or her family. What dogs want is for no one to ever leave. When you’re single you date other singles. When you’re a couple you date other couples. Reading that brilliant insight, I was willing to believe anything she put on the page after that. A wise, intuitive observation can convey more power than all the facts in Wikipedia. A well-worded aphorism carries all the authority of Confucius or Oscar Wilde. Hemingway’s first writing job was as a reporter covering the crime beat on the Kansas City Star. He took to heart the paper’s in-house style guide, which demanded short, choppy sentences filled with active verbs. And for the rest of his career he wrote terse prose based on that same highly readable newspaper style. People from larger families always use a clause to seize attention before they say anything. The idiot character is more fun to hear because he bends the language for his purpose. Write the most outlandish, challenging, provocative stories. To convince a reader of something beyond his own experience, start with what he does know, and you move in baby steps toward what he doesn’t. Readers recoil from the pronoun “I” because it constantly reminds them that they, themselves, are not experiencing the plot events. We hate that, when we’re stuck listening to someone whose stories are all about himself. Submerge the I. Always keep your camera pointed elsewhere, describing other characters. Strictly limit a narrator’s reference to self. Example: Dr. Watson gushing about Sherlock Holmes - because a heroic character telling his own story would be boring and off-putting. Write in the first person, but weed out almost all of your pesky “I”s. No two people ever walk into the same room. How your character describes the world doesn’t have to be based on anything factual. Actually, it’s more interesting if a character views the world through a mistake. People decide the nature of their world at a very young age. And they craft a way of behaving that will lead to success. You’re praised for being a strong little kid so you invest in your strength. Or you become the smart girl. Or the funny boy. Or the pretty girl. And this works until you’re about thirty years old. After your schooling is over, you recognize your chosen way of winning has become a trap. And a trap with diminishing rewards. You’re a clown no one will take seriously. Or you’re a beauty queen who sees her looks fading. You’re forced to realize your identity was a choice, and then to choose another. But you know this next strategy will never have the same passion as the one you’d chosen as a child. Now you’re especially aware that it’s a choice. And you know it, too, will likely fade.","Author of “Fight Club” with some thoughts and stories about writing and life.

Scepticism: A Very Short Introduction,Duncan Pritchard,0198829167,5,"The epistemological enterprise of seeking a foundation for knowledge that is indubitable, and hence absolutely certain, as Descartes was, then one is not going to hold that one’s everyday beliefs could ever fulfil that role. Our everyday conception of knowledge seems to leave us perfectly happy with the idea that knowledge can be fallible and not absolutely certain (and thus to a degree dubitable) while being bona fide knowledge nonetheless. Reasons for believing what we do: we can have such reasons even in the absence of infallibility and absolutely certainty. Radical scepticism: The sceptical claim is not merely that one does not know many of the things that one takes oneself to know. Rather, it is the stronger thesis that one does not have any good epistemic reason for believing many of the things that one takes oneself to know. If one proposes radical scepticism as a paradox, however, then one is under no such obligation to explain oneself. After all, the paradox is simply composed of the dialectical stand-off here between philosophy and commonsense, but that in the presence of such an impasse we are entitled to go with commonsense and thus reject the philosophical (i.e. sceptical) conclusion that we lack everyday knowledge. The radical sceptic is somehow illicitly raising the standards for knowledge. No-one thinks that two people are disagreeing if one person says ‘I am hungry’ and the other person says ‘I am not hungry’. If the same person made both assertions one after the other, then we would be puzzled, since they would seem to be contradicting themselves. But if two people make these assertions then there is no contradiction, since the ‘I’ in each case refers to a different person. So there is clearly a precedent for there being terms in our language that are context-sensitive in roughly the way that it is being suggested that ‘knows’ might be. We’re right and the sceptic is right. ‘Knows’ is a context-sensitive term Arational = neither rational nor irrational Suppose we want to work out whether someone’s belief that the tree that they are looking at is an oak amounts to knowledge. To do so we will consider various epistemically relevant factors. These might include why they believe what they do (e.g. is it because of the way the tree looks or is it based on someone else’s testimony?); how responsible they are in forming their belief (e.g. did they inspect the tree closely, or merely take a quick glance at it?); how likely it would be that this person could be wrong about this subject matter (e.g. are there types of tree in the vicinity that look like oaks but which aren’t oaks?); We are evaluating whether one belief (in this case about whether this tree is an oak) amounts to knowledge relative to a background of claims that are already accepted as knowledge. Rational evaluations are normally local in that we are not rationally evaluating all of our beliefs all at once, but only a sub-set of those beliefs, relative to a wider set of beliefs that are not in doubt (and which are thus treated as knowledge). The very idea that one could undertake a global rational evaluation - that is, to rationally evaluate all of one’s beliefs all at once - is simply incoherent. The questions that we raise and our doubts depend upon the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on which those turn. If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put. Accordingly, if at root our beliefs come down to faith, then it is hard to see why that doesn’t simply entail that we don’t know anything, just as the radical sceptic contends. If all our beliefs are open to question, then why be committed to the truth of anything? why should it matter any more what is true? That we are sometimes mistaken does not mean that we are always mistaken. There is always the possibility of error. We are fallible - and hence to some degree quite rightly uncertain - creatures. We find a moderate scepticism at work in the scientific method. Even well-founded scientific claims are nonetheless treated as provisional, in the sense of being open to being reevaluated if new evidence comes to light. The scientific revolution is in large part due to the rediscovery of ancient sceptical texts during the Renaissance. A virtue lies between two vices, a vice of excess and a vice of deficiency. The lack of courage - cowardice - is a vice, but one can also take excessive risks and thereby exhibit the very different vice of being rash or foolhardy. Being courageous is thus having the good judgement to be disposed to act between these two extremes. One needs to cultivate this virtue once acquired, or it is apt to be lost. Aristotle held that the good life is the life of virtue. If one is kind, generous, courageous, and so on, then one can flourish. The intellectual virtues include such traits as conscientiousness and open-mindedness, intellectually courageous, intellectual humility (as opposed to intellectual arrogance). Moderate scepticism is involved in being conscientious when one weighs up the evidence, rather than leaping to conclusions? Or in being open-minded in one’s opinions, as opposed to being dogmatic? Radical scepticism represents a vice of excess (i.e. of excessive doubt), with dogmatism representing the opposing vice of deficiency (i.e. of insufficient doubt). Pyrrhonian scepticism: there are some intriguing parallels between Pyrrhonian sceptical thought and Madhyamaka Buddhism, as founded by the Indian philosopher, Nāgārjuna. Pyrrhonians offer techniques designed to induce doubt in response to someone putting forward a theoretical claim, one can employ these modes to oppose them, with the result that this would engender a neutral attitude. This would eventually lead to a tranquil and untroubled state of mind. Pyrrhonians instead just maintain that we should continue inquiring. Just as we should avoid settled beliefs where we can, and always be open to the possibility of error, so we should avoid settled doubts where we can too, as both have a tendency to close down inquiry. Promote the suspension of belief. What the original Greeks meant by the word ‘sceptic’, which refers more to an inquirer than a doubter. There is nothing particularly laudable about people who stick to their convictions regardless of the rational support they have for those beliefs, Merely holding onto one’s beliefs no matter what looks like mere dogmatism, If one has really thought through why one is so convinced about this subject matter, then one should be able to rebut weak counterevidence. Rather than regarding oneself as knowing it all, one instead treats oneself as being a highly fallible agent with an imperfect grasp of the truth, and hence willing to learn from others around one.","I love scepticism as a subject, as a mindset, raising the standards of knowledge or belief.  Especially self-doubt: not believing yourself.  This book was a bit too academic, but worthwhile with good ideas."
Brain Rules for Aging Well,John Medina,0996032673,5,"For the group that socialized the most, the rate of cognitive decline was 70 percent less than for those who socialized the least. There was a cognitive boost in processing speed and working memory with as little as ten minutes of social interaction. Stress hormones kill T-cells. Your wounds heal at a rate 40 percent slower. Relationships take energy to maintain, consistently giving your brain a bona fide workout. Social interactions are the most complex, energy-intensive jobs your brain can consciously perform. While you maintain your closest relationships with five people at a time, you can have meaningful relationships of varying quality with an additional 150 people. It's not the overall number of interactions that benefit health, but the net quality of the individual interactions. Take the other person’s point of view, actively seeking to understand a different perspective. This effort transforms casual conversation into meaningful brain food. Cultivate repeated, unplanned interactions, spontaneously rubbing shoulders with good friends. Live close to friends and family so those shoulders are available for rubbing. Create a setting that encourages people to let their guard down. The more intergenerational relationships older people form, the higher the brain benefit turns out to be, especially when seniors interact with elementary-age children. The lonelier you are, the lonelier you become. In a six-month dance class, one hour per week: hand-motor coordination, fluid intelligence, short-term memory, and impulse control increased by 13 percent . Human touch is wildly important for the elderly. Optimism is knowing that bad things don’t last forever, that good will return. Brains don’t record life as if on a single reel-to-reel tape deck. Rather, many semi-independent memory subsystems exist - each responsible for recording and retrieving a specific domain of learning. Seniors prefer the higher probability of experiencing a positive emotion; reward size doesn’t matter. In youth, the altitude of happiness we experience is consistently stratospheric, and we want more. In our youth, our emphasis is on the future: “promotion motivation.” Heading into retirement, we try to protect what we’ve worked so hard to gain, shifting from promotion motivation to “prevention motivation”. We see ourselves in terms of preservation because time is short. Present happiness becomes more important than future reward. Reward prediction abilities decline more than 20 percent with age, which means reward prediction errors increase. You become more gullible. People often confuse depression with normal sadness. People in the grips of depression often don’t feel particularly sad. Instead, they become increasingly unfocused and demonstrably more irritable and restless, and they experience a steady erosion in things they used to find pleasurable. The more health challenges seniors encounter, the greater their depression risk becomes. One of the most solid biological findings that exists in the gerosciences: as humans age, the dopaminergic system begins functionally to decline. Dopamine mediates the willingness to take risks, and our psychological motivations. The brain is surprisingly good at conjuring up compensatory behaviors for cognitive functions it knows are eroding. The happiness data may represent the determined effort of a brain, faced with inexorable dopamine decline, refusing to go down without a fight. Or a smile. L-DOPA sparks dopamine : it improves elevates optimism bias. This experiment was done with a younger generation, so optimism may be influenced by dopamine levels even in healthy people. Seniors who are optimistic live a healthy 7.5 years longer than seniors who aren’t. Optimism exerts a measurable effect on their brain. The volume of their hippocampus doesn’t shrink nearly as much as the pessimist’s does. Seligman has codified the science of what makes people authentically happy: gratitude behaviors. Read Seligman’s book “Flourish”. Summary: Generate a list of the things that bring you true pleasure, then allow the items on the list to become a regular part of your life. Lose yourself in a hobby: good movies, books, sports - even a dance class. Pursue a purpose that gives your life meaning: a purpose larger than self. Achieve mastery in something over which you currently have no mastery at all. People who feel younger than their chronological age do better on cognitive tests than those who feel older. Ideal subjective age is twelve years younger than your actual age. Mindfulness improves our brains. Emotional regulation (especially the ability to manage stress) and cognition (especially the ability to pay attention). Mindful seniors are 86 percent more likely to score in the very positive range for markers of cardiovascular health than those who aren’t practicing. Awareness and acceptance can literally rewire your behavior. Create a robust social schedule for the rest of your life. Practice mindfulness meditation for the rest of your life. Semantic memory, a memory for facts, increases with the passing years. Procedural memory (motor memory) remains steady. Decision making is less impulsive, more thoughtful, because we have more options to weigh. Working memory: we used to call it short-term memory. Episodic memory, like working memory, gets worse with age. Go back to school. Enroll in a class. Pick up a new language. Plunge yourself into the deep end of learning environments every day. No exceptions. Experience a novel idea and actively, even aggressively, engage it. The best exercise is to find people with whom you do not agree and regularly argue with them. Productive engagement involves experiencing environments where you find your assumptions challenged, your perspective stretched, your prejudices confronted, your curiosity inspired. Productive engagement is one of the clearest ways to keep your memory batteries from draining. Episodic memory improved 600 percent above those in the receptive group. Teaching other people works beautifully, too. Try something new. It is one of the best experiences you can give your brain. Bilingual people perform significantly better on cognitive tests, regardless of the age at which the language is learned. People who know three languages outscore people who know two. Seniors who read at least 3.5 hours a day, were 17 percent less likely to die by a certain age. The reading has to be of books, long form. Every day you exercise your brain above what you do typically delays that deterioration by 0.18 years. Our ability to ignore distractions declines from a high of 82 percent when younger (average age 26) to a low of 56 percent when older (average age 67). Fluid intelligence is your ability to persuade your problem-solving talents to come out and play - to solve unique problems independent of your personal experience with them. Fluid intelligence is highly correlated with working memory ability. Crystallized intelligence is defined as the ability to draw from material learned by experience, using information previously stored. UC–San Francisco scientists developed a game called NeuroRacer that actually helps. Audio game called Beep Seeker improves working memory. Executive function (EF) is the behavior that allows you to get tasks done - and to be calm and civil while doing them. Greater physical activity means greater intellectual vigor, regardless of age. The protein BDNF, short for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, is thought to be responsible for much of this growth. You want BDNF in your brain. By exercising, you are not just slowing age-related decline. Your brain actually gets better at its job. You don’t have to do a lot to reap the benefit. Just take a walk. Or get into a pool. Do strength training two or three times a week Calorie restriction and plant-based diets exert their anti-aging effects through hormesis. Only five days a month confers the age-related benefits. Nostalgia: linking who you were in the past with who you are now. People who regularly experience the benefits of nostalgia are less afraid of dying. People become more generous to strangers after spending quality time in their “nostalgia zones.” They also become more tolerant of outsiders, especially ones with perceived social differences. Nostalgia didn’t affect just the participants’ attitudes. It also affected their bodies. Eyesight improved. Retrieval bias around age 20, skewed for events in our late adolescence/mid-20s. When did you have the most meaningful experiences of your long life? What’s the best popular music they ever listened to, the ones defining “their generation,” the answer is similar: the music they heard between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five. Fill an area of your current living environment with nostalgic items - the ones most likely to evince strong dopaminergic reactions : your personal Fountain of Youth. The Mediterranean and MIND diets have been shown to improve memory, lessen the chances for stroke, and be robustly associated with long life.","I recommend this 10/10 if you're over 60, 8/10 if you're over 40, 4/10 otherwise. Current research on brain aging, and how to slow or reverse its effects. Be very social. Read 3+ hours per week. Intensely learn something new, especially a new language. Take dance lessons. Practice gratitude and mindfulness. Flood your mind with nostalgic memories."
The Artist's Journey,Steven Pressfield,9781936891542,5,"The artist's journey comes after the hero's journey. Show me someone who claims ""I have no passion"" and I'll show you a born artist who's scared out of his wits to become that artist. Awaken from the morphine sleep of success into the life of an artist. Everything in her life that is ""not-artist"" now falls away. No more squandering voice or talent. She's on a mission now. The artist's journey is internal. ""Why don't you turn the desk around so you have a view outside?"" I don't care about the view outside. My focus is interior. The book or movie I'm writing is playing inside my head. The artist is not expressing himself. He is discovering himself. I never wrote anything good until I stopped trying to write the truth. Fiction is the truth. The artist's medium is not reality, but truth boiled down to its essence. Write what you don't know. Write to discover ""you"" - that wiser ""you"". What, precisely, does an artist do? Shuttle from the material world to the invisible world and back again. Bringing back something that had never existed in the First World before. You reach down through a shallow stream and you pull up a handful of bright, pretty pebbles. The stream bottom is one reality. Sunlight and air is the other. One is mysterious, the other matter of fact. One requires faith, the other reason. We plunge our hand through the surface, not sure what we'll find. We pull our hand back and examine what we've got. Good? Bad? Worth keeping? To be put where? Utilized how? In a four-hour working day, the writer shuttles between realities a thousand times. The creative call is scary. No wonder our initial impulse is to hide from it. We must create our own meeting with the mentor. What project terrifies you most? What work are you certain you can never pull off? What role will push you past your limits, and take you into places you have never gone? What journey will carry you off the map entirely? She will pause frequently, often for long moments. She is seeking the right word. But she does not consciously search for this. Rather she is waiting until the correct word arises of itself. I wake up at 5:30 a.m., put on my workout clothes, hail a taxi to the gym. The ritual is not the gym; the ritual is the taxi. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual. Doing it the same way each morning reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it differently. When I enter my office, I cross the threshold into a different dimension. What I had desired all my life was not to “live” but to express myself. I had never had the least interest in living, but only in this which I am doing now, something which is parallel to life, of it at the same time, and beyond it. What is true interests me scarcely at all, nor even what is real; only that interests me which I imagine to be, that which I had stifled every day in order to live. - Henry Miller, Tropic of Capricorn","I love this series of books from him, from War of Art to Turning Pro. This is worth reading if you need a nudge on this subject, but if you've read the others, it only offers a little more."
Swiss Watching,Diccon Bewes,1473677416,5,"The Swiss have more power than their politicians. Swiss love surnames. CH = Confœderatio Helvetica, Switzerland’s official name. Ask where his Heimatort, or place of origin, is and he where his ancestors came from. The home is rarely opened up to strangers. What to outsiders appears unfriendly is actually them respecting personal space and taking time to get to know someone. Switzerland accounts for 6 per cent of the fresh water in Europe. The mountains are the Swiss equivalent of the sea, the soul of the country. Beautiful and inviting yet defensive and unwelcoming. Being direct and stating the facts : not wanting to talk about trivia or divulge personal information. For many English speakers up is synonymous with north, and down with south. For the Swiss it’s about gradient not direction. Going down (north) to Basel but up (south) to Interlaken. Kantönligeist: The polite translation is that each canton has its own identity, culture and history. Switzerland never had one big capital. Bern, the federal capital, is the political centre Basel, thanks to the pharmaceutical companies, the industrial one Lausanne, home of the Supreme Court, the legal Geneva, HQ for the United Nations, the international Zurich, the biggest of the five, the economic Geneva is too international, and almost too French, while Lausanne is the closest thing Switzerland has to an alternative culture. Neither seems truly Swiss. Drinks party, or Apéro, is a big deal. Every guest’s first duty is to go round and greet everyone. How rude it would be to stand in a room with someone whose name you did not know. It would be unseemly to chat too long until you have met everyone. Once your hellos are done, you can return for a proper conversation. With friends, the handshake is supplemented by three cheek kisses (right–left–right) and a ‘How are you?’ Leaving a party is the same process as arriving but in reverse. You go round, shaking hands as you say goodbye but using the person’s name. The trick is to wait until someone else starts to leave. As they go round you follow a step or two behind, carefully listening to each name. To tell if the church is Protestant or Catholic: look up and see what’s on top of the spire or tower. A cockerel means it’s a Protestant church, a cross means it’s Catholic. Geneva’s inhabitants refuse to speak German. People have the power, and they use it. Don’t like a government decision? Then collect names to change it. Want to create a new law? Then collect names to initiate it. Hate minarets? Then collect names to ban them. The poll tax, the Iraq war, the privatisations and the tax hikes – all would be so much less likely to happen in Switzerland, precisely because they would be subject to a referendum. The Swiss people can initiate legislation or destroy it; they can force the government into new policies or reject decisions it’s already made. No one person or party ever has complete control – the people do. The Swiss people are the final decision makers on almost every single policy, whether it affects their own neighbourhood or the whole country. The people decide foreign policy. Political advertising on TV is banned. As part-time politicians, Swiss MPs remain relatively normal and don’t get carried away with their own importance. In Swiss eyes that’s an essential trait in public life, where parliament is about serving the people not yourself. Invitations almost never state a dress code because that would break two cardinal rules: you are implying that you don’t trust your guests to come dressed properly, and you are invading their privacy by telling them what to wear. Smart casual is a way of life, the only men to wear suits are bankers, lawyers and politicians. Trust sums up the essence of the country. You don’t ask questions and you expect everyone else to be as honest. Swiss cherish privacy more than anything. Swiss hate others telling them what to do and is one of the main reasons Switzerland is not in the European Union. Letting Brussels run their affairs would be invasion of Swiss privacy on a grand scale. Swiss red tape makes all others look pink. Only 35 per cent of Swiss own their own home. Fist clenched around his thumb = wish me good luck. In English “half seven” is a shortened form of half-past seven, whereas in German “halb sieben” translates as halfway to seven o’clock, 6.30. Peace and neutrality go hand in hand. An oasis of security in a troubled world, but maintaining it is only possible through upholding their neutrality. Switzerland didn't join the United Nations until 2002, after a close referendum. While the Red Cross deals with the aftermath of the latest war, Switzerland prepares for the next one. Their flags are the reverse of each other’s. Neutrality, Swiss style, is about being prepared. From the age of 20 a Swiss man must complete 260 days of compulsory military service, either all at once or in annual stages. Switzerland exports more arms than Israel, and has the world’s fourth highest gun ownership. Armed neutrality is a very Swiss concept. The Swiss love to buy Swiss brands. This quiet nation of conformists come up with more than its fair share of inventions. The anti-capitalism, anti-globalism, anti-Americanism, in fact anti-anything feeling has grown quite strong in a country that traditionally sees itself as pro-individual. Most Swiss people understate everything from their own wealth to the winter temperatures. If they say they only speak a little English, they’re probably nearly fluent. No in Switzerland is always a no; it’s never a no disguised as yes or even a maybe. Guests do not help in Swiss homes. Never set foot in the kitchen, never refill drinks, never clear the plates. Helping unasked implies that the hosts are not sufficiently organised and cannot cope on their own.","About the culture of Switzerland, written by a Brit. I love these kinds of country culture books, and have always been curious about Switzerland, so it scratched my itch, and has good insights. The description of how the government works was most interesting."
Mindfulness in Plain English,Henepola Gunaratana,0861719069,5,"Experiences are neither good nor bad. They are tepid, neutral, and uninteresting. But we ignore that fact and thus return to our endless round of desire and aversion. Learn not to want what you want. Learn to recognize desires but not be controlled by them. A well-disciplined mind brings happiness. Meditation tames the mind. When you reach a feeling of predictability and sameness in your meditation practice, you have gotten off track and are headed for stagnation. Become sensitive to the actual experience of living, to how things actually feel. Do not sit around developing sublime thoughts about living. Live. Meditation is learning to live. You don’t need to figure out everything. Discursive thinking won’t free you. In meditation, the mind is purified by wordless bare attention. Deliberation is not necessary to eliminate those things that are keeping you trapped. Just a clear look at what they are and how they work. That alone will dissolve them. Concepts and reasoning just get in the way. Don’t think. See. Dwelling upon differences between people leads directly to egotism, greed, envy, pride, jealousy, or hatred. When we watch the working of our body+mind, we tend to ignore things that are not pleasant and hold onto the things that are. The mind can never be focused without a mental object. The difference between being aware of a thought and thinking a thought: it passes away without giving rise to the next thought in that chain. Distraction cannot be seen as distraction unless there is some central focus to be distracted from. Observe the nature of conscious intention. Watch the delicate interrelation between the breath, the impulse to control the breath, and the impulse to cease controlling the breath. Eventually you will feel no impulse to manipulate it. You will have learned a major lesson about your own compulsive need to control the universe. Self-discipline is seeing through the hollow shouting of your own impulses. Avoiding unpleasantness is a very unkind thing to do to yourself. Examine unpleasantness to death. If you are miserable you are miserable; that is the reality. So confront that. The way out of a trap is to study the trap itself, learn how it is built. The trap can’t trap you if it has been taken to pieces. States of fear arise. Stand aside from the process and don’t get involved. Be a curious bystander. Don’t fight the situation. Let the whole mess bubble up and flow past. When any mental state arises strongly enough to distract you from the object of meditation, switch your attention to the distraction briefly. Make the distraction a temporary object of meditation. But only long enough to notice certain specific things about it. What is it? How strong is it? And how long does it last? These questions are not an invitation to more mental chatter. As soon as you have wordlessly answered these questions, you are through with your examination of that distraction, and you return your attention to the breath. Handle desire in the following manner: Notice the thought or sensation as it arises. Notice the mental state of desire that accompanies it as a separate thing. Notice the exact extent or degree of that desire. Then notice how long it lasts and when it finally disappears. When you have done that, return your attention to breathing. Craving and desire can apply to things we regard as virtuous: the desire to perfect yourself, craving for greater virtue. It is a desire for gratification and a clever way of ignoring the present-moment reality. Happiness, peace, inner contentment, sympathy, and compassion are mental states. See each one as it comes, then watch it drift away. Experience each mental state fully, exactly the way it is, adding nothing to it and not missing any part of it. A sound strikes your ear. Conceptualization takes over your experience. When you hear a sound in meditation, pay bare attention to the experience of hearing. That and that only. Reality is elegantly simple and unadorned. When you hear a sound, be mindful of the process of hearing. Everything else is just added chatter. Drop it. This same rule applies to every sensation, every emotion, every experience Keep your mindfulness on the breath until something else steps in and pulls your attention away. When you feel that happening, don’t fight it. Let your attention flow naturally over to the distraction, and keep it there until the distraction evaporates. Then return to breathing. We like the taste of certain poisons, and we stubbornly continue to eat them even while they are killing us. Thoughts to which we are attached are poison. You will find yourself quite eager to dig some thoughts out by the roots while you jealously guard and cherish certain others like parental protectiveness, or true love. Positive attachments hold you in the mud just as assuredly as negative attachments. With nonjudgmental observation, you see things without condemnation or judgment. You are surprised by nothing. You just observe. If you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is memory. When you then become aware that you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is mindfulness. If you then conceptualize the process and say to yourself, “Oh, I am remembering,” that is thinking. Mindfulness reminds you of what you are supposed to be doing, when your mind wanders from this focus. Every worldly thing is, in the end, unsatisfying. We avoid greed, lust, hatred, aversion, and jealousy because they are compulsive; because they take the mind over and capture the attention completely. Thus, mindfulness is the specific antidote for hindrances. Cultivate mindfulness and concentration, side by side. If one is strengthened at the expense of the another, meditation becomes impossible. Concentration is forcing the mind to remain on one static point. It can be developed by force, by sheer unremitting willpower. Mindfulness notices things. Concentration keeps the attention pinned down to one item. Mindfulness is not trying to achieve anything. It is just looking. Seated meditation is not the game. It’s the practice. The game is the rest of your life experience. The most important moment in meditation is the instant you leave the cushion. Bring those skills with you into the rest of your activities. Spend the rest of your days standing aside from your own needs and greeds. Just stand aside and watch it all flow past. Spend a few seconds every few minutes to check your posture - not to correct or to improve, just notice. Perform simple activities at very low speed - making an effort to pay full attention to every nuance. Meditation Instruction: Once you sit for meditation, do not change the position again until the end of the time you determined at the beginning. After taking three deep breaths, breathe normally, and begin focusing your attention on the feeling of breath going in and out. The purpose of counting is simply to focus the mind on the breath. Once your mind is focused on the breath, give up counting. The mind goes to sounds, memories, emotions, perceptions. Focus our attention on these states one at a time. As they fade return to the breath. The mind becomes more insightful from the impartial and unbiased watching of these occurrences. The various postures promote physical immobility, which is then reflected by an immobility of mind. The meditator’s three main enemies are pain, muscular tension, and falling asleep. Sit with your back straight. Head held in line with the rest of the spine. The rest of the body just hangs from it. An erect posture is very important. A position of arousal, and with it goes mental alertness. If you slouch, you are inviting drowsiness. Wear loose and soft clothes. Sit on a chair or a cushion. When sitting on the floor you need a cushion to elevate your spine - firm and at least three inches thick when compressed. Sit close to the front edge of the cushion and let your crossed legs rest on the floor in front of you. You need some sort of padding for your legs. A folded blanket will do. Ways you can fold your legs, in ascending order of preference: a) Native American style. Your right foot is tucked under the left knee and left foot is tucked under your right knee. b) Burmese style. Both of your legs lie flat on the floor from knee to foot. They are parallel with one in front of the other. c) Half lotus. Both of your knees touch the floor. One leg and foot lie flat along the calf of the other leg. d) Full lotus. Both knees touch the floor, and your legs are crossed at the calf. Your left foot rests on the right thigh, and your right foot rests on the left thigh. Both soles turn upward. Hands are cupped one on the other, and they rest on your lap with the palms turned upward. The hands lie just below the navel with the bend of each wrist pressed against the thigh. This arm position provides firm bracing for the upper body. Chin is up. You can always use a chair instead. Your back does not lean against the back of the chair. Legs side by side, feet flat on the floor. Begin by focusing the attention on the breathing and then go on to note all other physical and mental phenomena that arise. Establish a formal practice schedule. After a year or so of steady practice you should be sitting comfortably for an hour at a time. Recitations are psychological cleansing devices. ""May all living beings be well, happy, and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May they always meet with spiritual success. May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life. May they always rise above them with morality, integrity, forgiveness, compassion, mindfulness, and wisdom."" Put most of your effort into one-pointedness at the beginning. A couple of months down the track and you will have developed concentration power. Then you can start pumping your energy into mindfulness. If you find yourself getting frantic, emphasize concentration. If you find yourself going into a stupor, emphasize mindfulness.","Thoughts and instruction on Vipassana meditation, explained clearly."
How Music Works,David Byrne,1936365537,5,"The same music placed in a different context can not only change the way a listener perceives that music, but it can also cause the music itself to take on an entirely new meaning. Depending on where you hear it - in a concert hall or on the street - or what the intention is, the same piece of music could either be an annoying intrusion, abrasive and assaulting, or you could find yourself dancing to it. How music works is determined by what surrounds it, where you hear it and when you hear it. How it’s performed, how it’s sold and distributed, how it’s recorded, who performs it, whom you hear it with, and, of course, finally, what it sounds like. We work backward, creating work that fits the venue available to us. The space, the platform, and the software “makes” the art. Gothic cathedrals: reverberation time in those spaces is very long - more than four seconds. A composition with shifting musical keys would inevitably invite dissonance. What sounds best in this kind of space, is modal in structure - often using very long notes. The origin of jazz solos and improvisations was a pragmatic way of solving a problem that had emerged: the “written” melody would run out while the musicians were playing, and in order to keep a popular section continuing longer for the dancers who wanted to keep moving, the players would jam over those chord changes while maintaining the same groove. Around 1900, classical audiences were no longer allowed to shout, eat, and chat during a performance. They made new symphony halls and opera houses. (I guess it was assumed that the lower classes were inherently noisy.) This exclusionary policy affected the music being written, too - since no one was talking, eating, or dancing anymore, the music could have extreme dynamics. Composers knew that every detail would be heard, so very quiet passages could now be written. Separating the body from the head seems to have been an intended consequence - for anything to be serious, you couldn’t be seen shimmying around to it. The regions below the neck are socially and morally suspect. Club music emerged out of dance clubs in the same way that jazz did - by extending sections of the music so the dancers could show off and improvise. Birdcalls have evolved to fit the environment. In dense jungle foliage, a constant, repetitive, and brief signal within a narrow frequency works best - the repetition is like an error-correcting device. If the intended recipient didn’t get the first transmission, an identical one will follow. Birds that live on the forest floor evolved lower-pitched calls, so they don’t bounce or become distorted by the ground as higher-pitched sounds might. Water birds have calls that, unsurprisingly, cut through the ambient sounds of water, and birds that live in the plains and grasslands, like the Savannah Sparrow, have buzzing calls that can traverse long distances. Life is far more interesting than it needs to be, because the forces that guide it are not merely practical. I was incredibly shy. Making my art in public was a way of reaching out and communicating when ordinary chitchat was not comfortable for me. The most subversive thing was to look totally normal. To look like a rebel was to pigeonhole yourself in advance as someone who spoke only to other rebels. Pop music shows resemble both Western and Eastern classical theater: the audience knows the story already. The director’s interpretation holds a mirror up to the oft-told tale in a way that allows us so see it in a new light. People want to see something familiar from a new angle. Let the audience know you’re going to do something special before you do it. Tip them off and draw their attention in a way that isn’t obvious. Where’s the surprise if you let the audience in on what’s about to happen? Well, odds are, if you don’t alert them, half the audience will miss it. We listen more closely when we know we only have one chance, one fleeting opportunity to grasp something. Imagine that you could only experience a book by going to a reading, or by reading the text off a screen that displayed it only briefly before disappearing. I suspect that if that were the way we received literature, then writers (and readers) would work harder to hold our attention. They would avoid getting too complicated, and they would strive mightily to create a memorable experience. Music did get texturally more complex when it started being recorded. In a live situation, the ear can psychoacoustically zoom in on a sound or isolate a section of players and pick out a phrase or melody - the way we can pick out a conversation at a noisy dinner table if we can see the person talking. To just stick a mic up and expect it to capture what we have experienced, wasn’t going to happen. They would move the mics around during the recordings - exaggerating dynamics and shifting perspectives. Buffalo Bill and Geronimo and later Bob Dylan: taking on the persona of an innocent yet perceptive country boy. Hearing a new and strange piece of music for the first time often opens a door that you didn’t even know was there. Music tells us how other people view the world in a non-descriptive way. Music embodies the way those people think and feel. The electric guitars were breaking free of history. We made a series of recordings based on an imaginary culture. “Ethnic Forgeries” : create our own “field recordings” - a musical documentation of an imaginary culture. Like a Borges or Calvino story, but this would be a mystery in musical form. Detailed liner notes explaining the way music functioned in that culture and how it was produced there. We’d try to pretend that we didn’t necessarily already know how a guitar or piano was meant to be played, and we would reject some approaches if they seemed too informed by our own past experience. It is the music and the lyrics that trigger the emotions within us, rather than the other way around. Making music is like constructing a machine whose function is to dredge up emotions in performer and listener. Think of the artist as someone who is adept at making devices that tap into our shared psychological make-up and that trigger the deeply moving parts we have in common. In remote collaborations, leave the other person’s stuff alone as much as you possibly can. You work with what you’re given, and don’t try to imagine it as something other than what it is. That train had already left the station, and my job was to see where it wanted to go. This restriction on creative freedom turns out, as usual, to be a great blessing. The reason I use modes and chords that are easy to follow and harmonize with: I want music to be inviting, to offer the listener a place inside it. I would fill lots of pages with non-sequitors. Then phrases that would hint at the beginning of an actual subject often seemed to want to emerge. I would look for words that fit pre-existing melodic fragments. When some phrases, even if collected almost at random, begin to resonate together and appear to be talking about the same thing, it’s tempting to claim they have a life of their own. The lyrics may have begun as gibberish, but often, though not always, a “story” in the broadest sense emerges. Emergent storytelling, one might say. Words imply that the music is about what the words say, literally, and nothing more. If done poorly, they can destroy the pleasant ambiguity that constitutes much of the reason we love music. That ambiguity allows listeners to psychologically tailor a song to suit their needs, sensibilities, and situations, but words can limit that, too. I begin by improvising a melody over the music. I do this by singing nonsense syllables, but with weirdly inappropriate passion, given that I’m not saying anything. Once I have a wordless melody I’ll begin to transcribe that gibberish as if it were real words. I’ll listen carefully to the meaningless vowels and consonants on the recording, and I’ll try to understand what that guy (me), emoting so forcefully but inscrutibly, is actually saying. If a melodic phrase of gibberish ends on a high ooh sound, then I’ll transcribe that, and in selecting actual words, I’ll try to choose one that ends in that syllable. If my conscious mind might be thinking too much - anything - driving, jogging, swimming, cooking, cycling - that occupies part of the conscious mind and distracts it, works.","Some interesting historical perspectives I hadn't thought of, like how the venue's reverberation changed composition. Highlight for me was the Byrne/Eno creative thoughts on their approach to writing and recording music, which I've always loved."
The Way of the Linguist,Steve Kaufmann,1420873296,5,"It was only when I had a genuine desire to communicate or learn something meaningful in a new language that I was able to learn. Your studies will be much more enjoyable and effective if you read or listen to aspects of the new culture that attract you or subjects that you need to learn about. Seeking out meaningful content is your first step. To continue to progress in language learning you just need to listen, read, and learn words and phrases every day. It is that simple. Concentrate on learning the language from content that matters to you and interests you. Pursue your own needs and interests, rather than an externally imposed program. If you control your learning, you will learn faster. Pasqua once said that when an immigrant arrives in France his ancestors become the Gauls. At least symbolically, as a human being, I consider all ancient people as my ancestors. I can choose to partake of any of the traditions and cultures I see around me if I make the effort to learn them ... ... to make this previously unknown culture a part of me, to explore my human heritage. Let go of the security of your native language and culture and broaden your identity. Imitate how they act, engage in play-acting. Have fun and pretend that you are what you are not. Visualize yourself pronouncing like a native speaker and thinking in the language. Measure your input and measure your output to make sure you are on course to achieve your objective. You can only absorb the language through massive input. Focus on input first. Until you are fairly comfortable in the language, correct grammar should be a secondary consideration. Choose short items of a few lines. Later of two to five minutes in length. Listen to the same content over and over. The subject should be of interest, the voices pleasing to you, and the level not too difficult. Get in the habit of listening frequently: in the morning, during the day and in the evening. When you first listen, only get used to the sounds and the rhythm. Do not worry if you do not understand all of it. Listen a few times without reading the text. Then read the text carefully, look up new words in an online dictionary, and save new words and phrases to a list for later review. Focus on a small amount of content and get used to it, rather than trying to listen to constantly changing content. Let the phrases ring in your mind even after you stop listening. Repeat certain phrases out loud. Imitate the correct pronunciation. Reading a lot is essential. Seek out the audio version. Decide which words and phrases will be most useful to you. Phrases can be any group of two or more words that are useful for you to express yourself. Make these phrases a part of your daily language. The systematic learning of phrases is the most effective way to learn to express yourself accurately in a new language. Focus your efforts on phrases as the essential building blocks of language. First absorb the language by listening, reading and learning vocabulary. These activities will always account for about three quarters of your effort. But also allocate some time to work on your skills of expression: pronunciation, writing and conversation. Pronunciation should be a major area of emphasis from the beginning. READ sentences and paragraphs out loud, first very slowly and then more quickly, and always in a loud voice. Exaggerate. RECORD your own pronunciation and compare it to a native speaker. Learning whole phrases will also help establish correct habits with regard to verb tenses, prepositions and vocabulary. Heinrich Schliemann was able to express his thoughts orally and in writing after about six weeks of self-study. His method consisted of “reading a great deal aloud without making a translation, taking a lesson every day, constantly writing essays upon subjects of interest, correcting these under the supervision of a teacher, learning them by heart, and repeating in the next lesson what was corrected on the previous day.” Make weekly lists of new words and phrases from your learning and deliberately try to use them. You need to overwork the language processing capability of your brain by constant and frequent repetition during a period of intense learning. This period may vary from three months to twelve months. Fluency cannot be attained without sweat forming on your brow. The greater the efficiency of the training methods the more intense the learning experience, and therefore the better the results. The more you can study on your own, the more you control what you are studying, and the more you follow your interests and inclinations, the faster you will learn. Measure how much time you have spent on different activities of the “engine” of language learning every day. How many words did you read every day? How many words and phrases have you saved for learning? How many words do you know in total?","Written by someone who has learned many languages, he shares his story and advice. Useful recommendations."
How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life,Russ Roberts,1591846846,5,"Once you start to think about human motivation itself, it’s hard to think about anything else. Trying to understand your neighbor and, in turn, yourself really doesn’t get old. There’s a brand-new set of data every day to chew on and explore if you’re interested - all those interactions with friends, family, colleagues, and strangers. Economics is the study of how to get the most out of life. Choosing wisely and well. Aware of how my choices interact with the choices of others. We feel much worse about the prospect of losing our little finger than we do about the death of a multitude of strangers far away. Yet no civilized person would consider saving their little finger by letting a few million strangers perish. Yes, you are profoundly self-interested. But for some reason, you do not always act in what appears to be your self-interest. It's not that feeble spark of benevolence. Our behavior is driven by an imaginary interaction with an impartial, objective figure who sees the morality of our actions clearly. It is this figure we answer to when we consider what is moral or right. We imagine being judged not by God, and not by our principles, but by a fellow human being who is looking over our shoulder. It’s rational to steal or sin because no one is watching. The whole idea of God is that He’s always watching. Smith’s point is that you are always watching! Even if no one knows you’re stealing, you know. And as you contemplate committing the act, you imagine how an outsider would react to your moral failure. Our moral sense comes from experiencing approval and disapproval from others. A powerful tool for self-improvement: Imagining an impartial spectator encourages us to view ourselves as others see us. Paying attention instead of drifting through life oblivious to your flaws and habits. Had there been an actual spectator - a friend riding in the backseat, say - there’s no way I’d have acted as poorly as I did. Warren’s son Peter Buffett actually took a chance on the music; he dropped out of Stanford at nineteen, sold the stock his father had given him, ended up with a successful career as a musician, Did he make the right choice? Peter Buffett, the man who ended up selling his Berkshire Hathaway stock for $90,000 and giving up the $100 million he could have had in order to pursue a career as a musician. In his memoir, Life Is What You Make It. He claims to have no regrets. What could he have with the extra millions? Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be “lovely”. (Adam Smith's word that really means respectable, honorable, etc.) Human happiness arises from the consciousness of being beloved. When we earn the admiration of others honestly by being respectable, honorable, blameless, generous, and kind, the end result is true happiness. It is an end in and of itself. Because that’s the right thing to do. Ideal is achieved when your inner self mirrors your outer self. Undeserved praise is a reprimand - a reminder of what I could be. It’s our own praise that’s hardest to reject. We can convince ourselves of our loveliness when the reality is otherwise. Life is punctuated by choices between what is easy and convenient, and a chance to help those around you The “smaller decisions,” are really not so small. Day by day, they add up to a life. Our urges can easily overwhelm our judgment. Rather than see ourselves as we truly are, we see ourselves as we would like to be. Self-deception can be more comforting than self-knowledge. Confronting our frailty and our failings can be too painful. If we saw ourselves in the light in which others would see us if they knew all, a reformation would generally be unavoidable. We could not otherwise endure the sight. We notice the flaws in those around us to remind us of our own flaws and to spur us to self-improvement. Social norms coach us as to what is admirable and what is not. Our behavior sometimes falls short of our ideals not because we’re bad people and not because our self-interest outweighs our benevolence, but because we don’t realize we’re not living up to our ideals. Seek out a mentor or a truly impartial real-life spectator who can help you see through the haze of self-love that so often blinds us. Confirmation bias happens when we filter reality through our biases, ignoring evidence that challenges or refutes what we believe and eagerly accepting evidence that confirms what we believe. “The sea gets deeper as you go further into it.” The more you know, the more you realize how much there is to know. What can be added to the happiness of the man who is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear conscience? He complains about the stresses of his life and asks for my advice. Quit your job, I tell him. I can’t, he says. Next year I’ll quit and slow down. Just one more year. Then he’ll have enough, he says. The bar with the permanent sign - free beer tomorrow. “Millions?” replied the Mexican. “Then what?” The American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late…” We haven’t absorbed its lessons despite all the retellings. We often care more about the elegance of the device than for what it can achieve. He bought the better watch simply because it is a superior gadget, not be any more punctual. We want the latest, hippest, shiniest phone, car, and toy. It’s a way to signal to the world who we are. The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life, seems to arise from over-rating the difference between one permanent situation and another. Prudence: the virtue of taking care of oneself using both foresight - looking down the road to assess the consequences of our action - and self-control, the ability to give up something today in return for a greater gain in the future. We are capable of discerning the remote consequences of all our actions, and of foreseeing the advantage or detriment which is likely to result from them. This is Prudence, of all the virtues that which is most useful. Fame and riches? It’s not unpleasant. It just shouldn’t be pursued for its own sake. Meeting expectations of what is proper allows those around us to interact with us effectively and, more than that, with grace and style and pleasure. Propriety is about playing your part in the human symphony. Propriety is about matching our responses to those around us. The comfort we receive from a friend comes from experiencing our pain through the friend’s eyes. Because the friend is less pained than we can be, we are less pained. We expect less sympathy from a common acquaintance than from a friend. We expect still less sympathy from an assembly of strangers, and we assume, therefore, still more tranquillity before them, and always endeavour to bring down our passion to that pitch. Because strangers feel our pain less intensely than an acquaintance who in turn feels our pain less intensely than a friend or loved one, being around strangers helps us regain our emotional equilibrium even more effectively than being with a friend. When we pull ourselves together in front of a group of strangers we’re not just putting up a brave front. We actually feel better. Hold your anger for a day before you think of acting on it. We have just the right amount of concern for others. If we had more, we would find life difficult to bear. Less, and we would be unable to comfort our friends. The modern prudent man foregoes the potential of a large upside to avoid the downside. He would prefer the undisturbed enjoyment of secure tranquillity to the real and solid glory of performing the greatest and most magnanimous actions. Hard-and-fast rules are easier to keep than rules that are slightly relaxed. Virtuous behavior is like good writing. We know it when we see it, but it is not easily taught or described. Better to have a rule like “Always hold your kids’ hands when offered” or “Always give your kids your full attention,” even if they’re not really universal rules and even if you know you can’t keep them with the “greatest exactness.” Those unrealistic, unkeepable rules remind you to watch out for your self-centeredness and keep in mind what the impartial spectator might think of you if he saw you watching the game or mindlessly surfing the Internet. Kant's categorical imperative says that when you are trying to decide on a course of action or when you face a moral dilemma, you should consider what the impact would be, and not just of your own action, but what the world would be like if everyone behaved that way.",Adam Smith wrote “Theory of Moral Sentiments” in the 1700s. Now Russ puts it into modern language and times. Main point is that our morality comes from imagining being judged by our fellow man.
Daily Rituals: How Artists Work,Mason Currey,52262785,5,"A solid routine fosters a well-worn groove for one’s mental energies and helps stave off the tyranny of moods. Put part of your life on autopilot. By forming good habits, we can free our minds to advance to really interesting fields of action. The importance of keeping regular hours in order to cultivate a daily creative rhythm. The more of the details of our daily life we can hand over to the effortless custody of automatism, the more our higher powers of mind will be set free for their own proper work. There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision, and for whom the lighting of every cigar, the drinking of every cup, the time of rising and going to bed every day, and the beginning of every bit of work, are subjects of express volitional deliberation. The great men never stop working. They never lose a minute. All of them made the time to get their work done. To discipline passion, decide what you ought to do during the day, then always do it at exactly the same moment every day, and passion will give you no trouble. There were no parties, no bourgeois values. We completely avoided all that. There was the presence only of essentials. It was an uncluttered kind of life, a simplicity deliberately constructed so that she could do her work. Three hours a day will produce as much as a man ought to write. I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. There is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write. You read what you have written and, as you always stop when you know what is going to happen next. I don’t believe in draining the reservoir. I believe in getting away from the typewriter while I still have things to say. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it’s a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind. One drawback to this self-made schedule is that it doesn’t allow for much of a social life. “People are offended when you repeatedly turn down their invitations.” But he decided that the indispensable relationship in his life was with his readers. “My readers would welcome whatever life style I chose, as long as I made sure each new work was an improvement over the last.” I have acquired the reputation over the years of being prolix when in fact I am measured against people who simply don’t work as hard or as long. Literary success has made literary productivity increasingly difficult. The world, it seems, will pay me to do anything BUT write! With daily routines, the useful thing is to have one that feels new. It can almost be arbitrary. You know, you could say to yourself, ‘From now on, I’m only going to write on the back porch in flip flops starting at four o’clock in the afternoon.’ And if that feels novel and fresh, it will have a placebo effect and it will help you work. I certainly have a routine, but the most important thing, when I look back over my career, has been the ability to change routines. I liked the feeling of getting up really early. The mind is newly cleansed but it’s also befuddled and you’re still just plain sleepy. I found that I wrote differently then. I usually wake up for an hour or so during the night. I am not an insomniac. I enjoy that nightly hour and make good use of it. I sleep alone. His timer now rang four times a day: at midnight, 1:00 A.M., 5:00 A.M., and 7:00 A.M., for one hour of nocturnal composition in addition to his usual two hours at dawn. He followed this routine seven days a week, holidays included, until only a few days before his death. Character, for Kant, is a rationally chosen way of organizing one’s life, based on years of varied experience - indeed, he believed that one does not really develop a character until age forty. And at the core of one’s character, he thought, were maxims - a handful of essential rules for living that, once formulated, should be followed for the rest of one’s life. Proust made a conscious decision in 1910 to withdraw from society, spending almost all his time in the famous cork-lined bedroom of his Paris apartment, sleeping during the day, working at night, and going out only when he needed to gather facts and impressions for his all-consuming work of fiction. I have never been able to compose unless sure that no one could hear me. Picasso wanted a lifestyle which would permit him to work in peace without material worries - ‘like a pauper, but with lots of money.’ Given his inherited income, one may wonder why Green bothered going in to the office at all - he certainly didn’t need the money. Though he occasionally spoke to his friends about giving up Pontifex and living off his unearned income in order to do nothing but write, he was beginning to find that the office routines of Henry Yorke were useful, even essential, to the imaginative work of Henry Green. He feared his own volatility and often referred to his need for habitual routines to keep him sane. The job gave him day-to-day stability as well as experiences that he could use in his writing. “Having a job is one of the best things in the world that could happen to me. It introduces discipline and regularity into one’s life. I am just as free as I want to be and of course I have nothing to worry about about money.” He would get a start on the day’s work before he even sat down at his desk, thinking of the first two sentences he wanted to write while soaking in the bath. Between work and home he walked, a distance of three or four miles each way. Most days, he took an additional hour-long walk on his lunch break. It was on these walks that he composed his poetry, stopping now and then to scribble lines I’ve found over the years that any momentary change stimulates a fresh burst of mental energy. So if I’m in this room and then I go into the other room, it helps me. If I go outside to the street, it’s a huge help. If I go up and take a shower it’s a big help. Home: “I try to keep home very pretty, and I can’t work in a pretty surrounding. It throws me.” As a result, she has always worked in hotel or motel rooms, the more anonymous the better. I am a completely horizontal author. I can’t think unless I’m lying down. My moods are more or less inversely related to the clarity of the sky. The French philosopher liked to sleep until mid-morning, then linger in bed, thinking and writing, until 11:00 or so. “Here I sleep ten hours every night. And after my mind has wandered in sleep through woods, gardens, and enchanted palaces where I experience every pleasure imaginable, I awake to mingle the reveries of the night with those of the day.” At noon Hugo headed downstairs for lunch. These were the days when prominent men were expected to have opening hours like museums. Hugo welcomed almost everyone. As the clock struck twelve, he would appear and conduct his guests to the dining-room. It’s the hardest work in the world to try not to work! My pleasant disposition likes the world with nobody in it. Her beloved countryside. “When I think of death,” she once said, “I only regret that I will not be able to see this beautiful country anymore.” The pleasures of not writing are so great that if you ever start indulging them you will never write again. He was careful to give at least three hours a day to the writing project at hand; otherwise, he said, there was a risk he might forget what it’s about. A solid routine, he added, “saves you from giving up.” Writing interests me more than anything else. If I made a chore of it, my enthusiasm would die. I make it an adventure every day. I get more entertainment from it than any I could buy. When beginning a new book, she tends to slip into a routine naturally, without any conscious planning. And once she’s adopted a writing schedule, she doesn’t need to force herself to work. But she does have to be strict about avoiding social engagements and other outside entanglements. “Because you won’t get those four hours if you’re spending most of the day worried about getting to an appointment and back,” she says. “What you have to do is clear all distraction.” He followed a regular writing routine only when the work was going badly. The ritual is a friendly reminder that I’m doing the right thing. This schedule does not allow for a particularly sociable life. It’s actively anti-social. On the other hand, it is pro-creative. A creative life has the nourishing power we normally associate with food, love, and faith. Make yourself ready to dream just as you make yourself ready to sleep by going to bed at roughly the same time each night and following the same ritual as you go. In both writing and sleeping, we learn to be physically still at the same time we are encouraging our minds to unlock from the humdrum rational thinking of our daytime lives. You couldn’t even type a business letter without revealing something of your inner self. ==== EXAMPLE ROUTINES For over fifty years I have not stopped working for an instant. From nine o’clock to noon, first sitting. I have lunch. Then I have a little nap and take up my brushes again at two in the afternoon until the evening. [A]t six o’clock he got up, washed and had coffee and a few slices of bread for breakfast; at seven he went into the studio and worked non-stop until twelve, when he stopped to do an hour of energetic exercise, like boxing or running; at one o’clock he sat down for a frugal but well-prepared lunch, A nap, but for just five minutes; at two he would receive a friend, deal with business matters or write letters; at three he returned to the studio, where he stayed until dinner time at eight o’clock; after dinner he would read for a while or listen to music. Started at six in the morning, say, and may go on until noon. Sit down at nine o’clock in the morning and work straight through the morning until lunchtime, then in the afternoon letters - or, rather more important, is that I go for a walk, where I plan out what I’m going to write in the next period at my desk. I then come back. After tea, up to my studio and work through until about eight o’clock. After dinner I usually find I’m too sleepy to do much more than read a little bit, and then go to bed rather early. I would get up around four, four-thirty. And I write some. Make coffee sometimes, or not. I write for maybe an hour and a half. But then I get really sleepy. So I go back to sleep and then I wake up at around eight-thirty.” After waking for the second time, Baker talks with his wife, drinks another cup of coffee, eats a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, and goes back to his writing, this time focusing on “daylight kind of work,” like typing up notes for a nonfiction piece, transcribing an interview, or editing When Balzac was working, his writing schedule was brutal: He ate a light dinner at 6:00 P.M., then went to bed. At 1:00 A.M. he rose and sat down at his writing table for a seven-hour stretch of work. At 8:00 A.M. he allowed himself a ninety-minute nap; then, from 9:30 to 4:00, he resumed. At 4:00 P.M. Balzac took a walk, had a bath, and received visitors until 6:00, when the cycle started all over again. Dickens’s working hours: was in his study by 9:00. He stayed there until 2:00. Promptly at 2:00, Dickens left his desk for a vigorous three-hour walk through the countryside or the streets of London, continuing to think of his story and, as he described it, “searching for some pictures I wanted to build upon.”","Collections of the creative routines of famous writers, artists, musicians, and scientists.

The Story of French - by Jean,it Nadeau and Julie Barlow,0312341849,5,"A Creole language is born when populations of different origins combine elements of their languages to form a new one. Properly speaking, it becomes a Creole when it evolves into a mother tongue, transmitted from parents to children - that’s what distinguishes it from a lingua franca or a pidgin (trade jargon). Of the world’s 127 Creoles, thirty-five are English-based and fourteen are French-based. There are more speakers of French-based Creoles than all other Creoles combined (including English), thanks mostly to Haiti, the biggest Creole-speaking nation in the world. Esprit, a difficult concept to translate that is a combination of wit, cleverness, eloquent rhetoric and liveliness. The art of conversation required speakers to be playful, to make witty comebacks and offer sudden and surprising insights. In France the eighteenth century is known as le siècle des lumières (the century of light and knowledge, or the Enlightenment). If triangles had a god, they would give him three sides. English picked up hundreds of words during this period, including elite, avalanche, reservoir, bouquet, engagement, salon, buffet, liaison, caprice, façade, fanfare, pirouette, maladroit, bourgeois, éclat, manoeuvre and début. Sans Souci (“free of care”) Belgium was never meant to be. Belgians have different terms for institutions; they do not speak of the maire (mayor) and lycée (college) but of the bourgmestre and athénée. They use terms such as wassingue (floor cloth) and drache (heavy rain). Germanic influence has led Belgians to use terms such as une fois (once), which is a calque, or loan translation, of the Flemish eenmaal. Belgians also count differently. Whereas the French have come to say soixante-dix (literally “sixty and ten,” for seventy), quatre-vingts (“four twenties,” for eighty) and quatre-vingt-dix (“four twenties and ten,” for ninety), the Belgians kept the more sensible septante, huitante and nonante, which are calqued on the French quarante (forty), cinquante (fifty) and soixante (sixty). For eighty some Belgians say octante, but more prefer, quatre-vingts. Although it sounds more modern to say septante or nonante, the terms actually come from an older system of counting. The term restaurant originates from a shop near the Louvre Palace in Paris that in the 1760s served a meat-based broth known as a bouillon restaurant (restoring broth). The term gave birth to the idea of a restaurateur, the person who owned the establishment. But the big shift came with the Revolution. Prior to that, most chefs cooked for bourgeois or aristocratic families and their numerous guests. When their bosses fled abroad to avoid jail or the guillotine during the Revolution, these chefs and maîtres d’hôtel found themselves out of work, so they started opening their own establishments. The French had invented the metric system during the Revolution. Over half the fifty-seven countries in Africa and around the Indian Ocean use French, many as an official language. Agence pour l’enseignement du français à l’étranger (Agency for French Teaching Abroad). There are now more than 430 French collèges and lycées in 125 countries. Today no country in the world is as actively engaged in cultural diplomacy as France. A country’s reputation depends on its ability to represent itself through artistic and educational programs. Diplomats today achieve as much by capitalizing on the attractions of their country as they do by using coercion or offering financial aid. Fibre optics, HDTV and smart cards are all French inventions. Léopold Sédar Senghor: The cultural renaissance of sub-Saharan Africa that started in Paris in the 1920s. The climate of intellectual and (relative) racial freedom in Paris in the first quarter of the twentieth century had drawn many black American authors of the Harlem Renaissance to Paris. They in turn inspired African intellectuals and future African leaders and intellectuals such as Senghor and Césaire. The encounter between American and African blacks sparked a transformation of African language, poetry and politics. Ivory Coast French became a language of communication within an extremely diverse population - it was not just the language of the elite. Ivorians are known to speak their own brand of French, français populaire ivoirien. In addition, Dioula melded with French to create a widely spoken dialect called Moussa. Young Ivorians later transformed Moussa into an artificial slang called Nouchi. Nouchi is grammatically based on French, but incorporates words from other languages that have landed on Ivorian soil - Arabic, Chinese, English and more. This slang, in turn, has developed into another, competing jargon called Zouglou. There are many more Arabicisms in mainstream French than Africanisms. Two million Algerians have emigrated to France. As a result, terms such as clebs (dog), smala (tribe, following), caïd (big shot, mafia boss), flouze (dough, cash), baroud (ultimate battle), fissa (quick), souk (market, disorder), caoua (coffee) and bakchich (baksheesh) are now common in colloquial French. The seventeenth-century French missionary Alexandre de Rhodes was the first to transcribe the Annamite (later called Vietnamese) language from ideograms into Latin characters. Nguyen Tat Thanh (1890–1969), much better known as Ho Chi Minh (“he who brings light”). Ho Chi Minh studied at the French lycée of Hué and moved to Paris in 1917. Although only ten percent of Senegalese are officially regarded as fully francophone, and another twenty percent as partially francophone, it was rare to meet anyone in a city who didn’t have a functional understanding of French. Even in the countryside, most people we met had at least a veneer of French. Only ten countries in the world, and very small ones at that, are classified as strictly monolingual. CLAC is a catchy abbreviation for Centre de lecture et d’animation communautaire (Centre for Reading and Community Activity). Small libraries - of about 2,500 books - that would offer other types of services, including Internet access, games, movie-screening facilities and sound systems for shows. 213 CLACs have been opened in seventeen countries. The rate of success in national exams is three to four times higher in communities with a CLAC than those without. Forcing international civil servants, diplomats or ministers to express themselves in a language that is not theirs amounts to putting them in a situation of inferiority. It deprives them of the capacity for nuance and refinement, which amounts to making concessions to those who speak that language as a mother tongue. Words express a culture, a way of thinking and a world view. TV5.org offers tips on using the French language. Staff rewrites every news item with the world in mind. The décloisonnement (decompartmentalization) of cultures. “I didn’t want an African film just to be for Africans. African cinema must be seen in Hanoi, Tokyo, Rio, Dakar, Cairo, and conversely.” The language used in les cités is an important source of new vocabulary. The main form of jargon is a word-crunching system called verlan, whose origins date back to the seventeenth century. Verlan has been popular in France’s suburbs since the 1970s. It consists of reversing syllables and writing them phonetically; the term itself is verlan for à l’envers (in reverse). It has produced one of the most interesting expressions of the political landscape in France: les beurs, verlan for rab, the Arabic term for Arabs, referring to French of North African descent. The jargon of the cités is evolving constantly and regularly entering mainstream usage, often through publicity. Suburban kids don’t speak of français but rather céfran. The beurs who make it to the middle class are now called les beurgeois. A femme (woman) is meuf, a flic (cop) is keuf, mère (mother) is reum, père (father) is reup and a prof (teacher) is a frop. Verlan goes as far as reverlanizing its terms, so that Arabs, first beurs, have become rebeus, and femmes, first meufs, have become feums. Comme ça (like that) was first verlanized as comme aç, then as askeum, and then as asmeuk.","Just an interesting history and present look at the French language. I had no idea what an influence French was on English, and didn't understand its role in current Africa. Makes me want to learn French."
Island,Aldous Huxley,0061561797,5,"What did your mother do when you hurt yourself? “My poor baby, my poor little baby.” But that’s awful! That’s the way to rub it in. “My poor baby,” she repeated derisively, “it must have gone on hurting for hours. And you’d never forget it.” what was all the fuss about? The river of life - a great smooth silent river that flows so still, so still, you might almost think it was asleep. A sleeping river. But it flows irresistibly. Book title: “Notes on What’s What, and on What It Might be Reasonable to Do about What’s What.” The Yogin and the Stoic - two righteous egos who achieve their very considerable results by pretending, systematically, to be somebody else. The more a man knows about himself in relation to every kind of experience, the greater his chance of suddenly, one fine morning, realizing who in fact he is. Mohammed’s words, Marx’s words, Hitler’s words - people take them too seriously, and what happens? You don’t renounce the world or deny its value; you don’t try to escape into a Nirvana apart from life. No, you accept the world, and you make use of it; you make use of everything you do, of everything that happens to you, of all the things you see and hear and taste and touch. Your metaphysicians make statements about the nature of man and the universe; but they don’t offer the reader any way of testing the truth of those statements. When we make statements, we follow them up with a list of operations that can be used for testing the validity of what we’ve been saying. Make the body capable of doing many things. ‘Mother’ is strictly the name of a function. When the function has been duly fulfilled, the title lapses; the ex-child and the woman who used to be called ‘Mother’ establish a new kind of relationship. Nobody expects them to cling, and clinging isn’t equated with loving. An entirely different kind of family. Not exclusive, like your families, and not predestined, not compulsory. An inclusive, unpredestined and voluntary family. Wider sympathies and deeper understandings. But you mustn’t think that it’s only when they’re in trouble that children resort to their deputy parents and grandparents. They do it all the time, whenever they feel the need for a change or some kind of new experience. History is the record of what human beings have been impelled to do by their ignorance and the enormous bumptiousness that makes them canonize their ignorance as a political or religious dogma. People are at once the beneficiaries and the victims of their culture. Patriotism is not enough. But neither is anything else. Science is not enough, religion is not enough, art is not enough, politics and economics are not enough, nor is love, nor is duty, nor is action however disinterested, nor, however sublime, is contemplation. Nothing short of everything will really do. I do muscular work, because I have muscles; and if I don’t use my muscles I shall become a bad-tempered sitting-addict. Changing jobs doesn’t make for the biggest output in the fewest days. But most people like it better than doing one kind of job all their lives. If it’s a choice between mechanical efficiency and human satisfaction, we choose satisfaction. I did a stint at the copper smelters. After which I had a taste of the sea on a fishing boat. Sampling all kinds of work - it’s part of everybody’s education. One learns an enormous amount that way - about things and skills and organizations, about all kinds of people and their ways of thinking. Never forget: pain always means that something is wrong. You’ve learned to shut pain off, but don’t do it thoughtlessly, don’t do it without asking yourselves the question: What’s the reason for this pain? Shut it off knowing that, if anything needs to be done, it will be done. Discourage children from taking words too seriously. Teach them to analyze whatever they hear or read. This is an integral part of the school curriculum.","This book totally changed my life at a key moment, when I was 22. It made me quit my job and pursue a life of variety. Some great ideas inside, especially the ones about family and healthy child-rearing. I just re-read it now, 22 years later, and it didn't hit me as hard as it did back then, maybe because I've internalized its philosophies so completely."
Ready for Anything,David Allen,25966949,5,"Maximum productivity is making something happen with as little effort as possible. Effort implies resistance. Improving productivity = dealing with the hindrances. Mosquitoes can ruin the hunt for big game. Something is coming - probably within a few days - that’s going to change your world. Are you ready? Or do you feel more out of control? Some major life event causes them to rethink it all and get some clarity around their commitments. I suggest you do that weekly. If you try to make something too simple, it will make everything seem more complex and difficult. “How do I set priorities?” My question back: “What’s your job?” You must know what you want to maintain, accomplish, or experience. As you sensitize and train yourself to assess and dispatch anything appropriately, you increase your maturity to do that with ever loftier outcomes.","I read this in 2004, before Getting Things Done (same author), and liked it more, because it's more philosophical than instructional. It made a big impact on me then. I was just re-reading now for a little refresher."
Starting Strength,Mark Rippetoe,0982522738,5,"Strength acquisition must be the same as that in which the strength will be used. Bone is living, stress-responsive tissue, just like muscle, ligament, tendon, skin, nerve, and brain. It adapts to stress just like any other tissue, and becomes denser and harder in response to heavier weight. == WARM UPS The motor pathway – the neuromuscular adaptation to a complicated movement pattern – must be prepared every time it is used. The warm-up sets prepare the motor pathway at the same time that they prepare the tissues for the upcoming heavier work. The inevitable injuries that will result from lack of warm-up: Yes, warm-ups are that critical. Riding an exercise bike (a better method, due to the greater range of motion the knees are exposed to during the exercise, better preparing them for the squat), a rowing machine (the best method, due to its range of motion and the full involvement of the back and arms as well as the legs). The squat should be carefully and thoroughly prepared with a couple of empty-bar sets, and then as many as five sets between those and the work sets. Any area that is injured will require additional warming up. If the injured area does not respond to the warm-up sets by starting to feel much better after you do two or three sets with the empty bar, you will have to decide whether to continue with light sets or wait until the area has healed better. The last warm-up set should never be so heavy that it interferes with the work sets, but it must be heavy enough to allow you to feel some actual weight before you do the work sets. Heavy enough that the first work set is not a shock. Most people will need to select three to five warm-up sets. Warm-ups serve two very important purposes. First, warm-ups actually make the soft tissue – the muscles and tendons, and the ligaments that comprise the joints – warmer. This step is important for injury prevention, since it is more difficult to injure a warm body than a cold one. The older the adult, the more time is needed for pre-workout preparation. Light warm-up sets, done first with the empty bar and then progressively heavier until the work sets are loaded, prepare the movement pattern itself so that when the weight gets heavy, you can focus your attention on pushing hard instead of worrying about how to push. == PROGRAM PLAN The program requires that you increase weight every workout for as long as possible. Stronger does not necessarily mean more weight on the bar. Resist the temptation to add weight at the expense of correct technique. You need to try to add weight to the work sets of the exercise every time you train, until you can’t do this anymore. This is the basic tenet of “progressive resistance training,” For as long as possible, make sure that you lift a little more weight each time. Everyone can do this for a while, and some can do it for longer than others, depending on individual genetic capability, diet, and rest. If you are challenged, you will adapt, and if you are not, you won’t. The deadlift will be stronger than the squat, the squat stronger than the bench press, the bench press and the power clean close to each other, and the press lighter than the other four. You do not need to do many different exercises to get strong – you need to get strong on a very few important exercises, movements that train the whole body as a system. The more stress that can be applied to as much of the body at one time as possible, the more effective and productive the adaptation will be. Squat every workout and alternate the bench press and press, and the deadlift and power clean. Do the exercises in the listed order, with squats first, the upper-body movement second, and the pulling movement third. This sequence allows the squat to get everything warm for the next exercise (it does this well); then the upper-body exercise allows the legs and back to rest and recover for the pulling movement to be done next. Chin-ups can be added as the only really useful assistance exercise. Add three sets of chins after your power cleans, and stay with this program for as many months as possible. Or, back extensions or glute/ham raises can be added in place of pulling every workout, dropping the deadlift frequency to every fifth workout, alternated with power cleans. This might be necessary if recovery is becoming a problem, as it might be for an older trainee, a female trainee, or someone who just refuses to eat and sleep enough. Any assistance exercises that are added must be kept in their proper perspective; they are there to help you get stronger in the basic lifts, not as an end in themselves. The press and the bench press, for example, will always be more important than arm work, and if curls and triceps exercises interfere with your recovery from pressing or benching, instead of adding to your strength in these lifts, they are being misused. The easiest way to stop your progress between workouts is to fail to finish all the reps of all the prescribed work sets. And the easiest way to make this happen is to fail to rest long enough between work sets to allow fatigue from the previous set to dissipate before you start the next set. If fatigue accumulates as the work sets progress, the predictable outcome will be that instead of 5-5-5 reps, you will do 5-4-3 when 5-5-5 was actually possible had you waited long enough between sets. This is the most common error made by novice trainees: the confusion of strength training with conditioning work. If the weight is actually too heavy – because you took too big a jump or you have not recovered from the previous workout – then your programming must change. But impatience is a poor reason to allow progress to come to a halt. When you miss the last rep or two of your last work set, the easy gains are beginning to wane, and you can take 5-pound jumps for several months; back up 5 pounds and start with 5-pound jumps. When these smaller jumps can no longer be sustained, a trainee can be considered an intermediate, and the fun begins with more complicated manipulation of training variables. This variation in exercises, tonnage, and intensity for the purpose of ensuring continued progress is referred to as periodization. Programming beyond the novice phase is beyond the scope of this book and is dealt with in detail in Practical Programming for Strength Training, Second Edition. Ambition is useful, greed is not. Most of human history and the science of economics demonstrate that the desire for more than is currently possessed drives improvement, both personally and for societies. But greed is an ugly thing when uncontrolled and untempered with wisdom, and it will result in your program’s progress coming to an ass-grinding halt. Four or so meals per day, based on meat and egg protein sources, with lots of fruit and vegetables and lots of milk. Lots. Most sources within the heavy-training community agree that a good starting place is one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight per day, with the rest of the diet making up 3500–6000 calories. Training drives strength acquisition, the strength increase drives mass gain, and the mass gain facilitates the strength increase. The training stress has to constantly increase by as much as you can tolerate every workout. The variable is the load, not the number of exercises, sets, or reps. If you are not training hard enough to produce occasional soreness, and are therefore not having to train while sore, you are not training very hard. Waiting until soreness subsides before doing the next workout is a good way to guarantee that soreness will be produced every time, since you’ll never get adapted to sufficient workload frequency to stop getting sore. In contrast to normal soreness, which by its nature is delayed for several hours after the workout, an injury can be defined as something that happens to the body that causes pain in a way that is not the normal consequence of a correctly performed exercise. Chronic injury is usually an inflammatory response to the overuse of a joint or its associated connective issue due to poor technique or excessive training volume. Tendinitis and bursitis are common diagnoses and are usually the result of repeated exposures to maladaptive stress. If you have missed just a few workouts (fewer than five or six), repeat the last workout you did before the layoff. You should be able to do this, although it may be hard. This approach results in less progress lost than if significant backing-off is done, and the following workout can usually be done in the order it would have been had the layoff not occurred. The neuromuscular system remembers how to lift heavy weights even if the muscles are out of shape. It allows you to lift more than you are actually in condition to do without incurring adverse effects. == SQUAT The squat is the single most useful exercise in the weight room. Training the hip drive – the active recruitment of the muscles of the posterior chain. The muscles that produce hip extension – the straightening out of the hip joint from its flexed (or bent) position in the bottom of the squat. These muscle groups – also referred to as the hip extensors – are the hamstrings, the glutes, and the adductors. Keeping the bar directly over the mid-foot through the complete range of motion constitutes the most efficient way the work should be done during the lift. Good technique in barbell training is the ability of the lifter to keep the bar vertically aligned with the balance point. The bar should therefore be in the lowest secure position it can occupy on the back, right below the spine of the scapula.","For those who ever considered getting fit, this is the way to do it, and the best book on the subject. Not sure if I should put this in my book list, because it's not something you read, but something you do."
The Now Habit,Neil Fiore,1585425524,5,"Keep track of when and why she procrastinated for a few days to make her aware of when the old views were most likely to lead her into negative patterns. When she found herself procrastinating, she was to be alert to her habit of using procrastination to escape inner conflict and anxiety. Why we procrastinate: it rewards us with temporary relief from stress. A defense against fear of success by keeping us from doing our best. Those who gain their sense of identity from many areas are more resilient when failing in any one area. For example, a professional tennis player is more likely to be upset by losing a match than is an amateur player for whom tennis is only one of many activities in the week. The more complex and varied your sense of self, the less likely you are to become depressed over stress in one area. Success means advancement to increasing demands. Completing a particular project will be a mixed blessing, leading to both gains and losses. Become aware of how and when you procrastinate. Record the time spent on each activity throughout your day. You take more than an hour to “settle in” before really getting started. What would happen to your efficiency level if you started on a high-priority project first thing in the morning, rather than reading the mail? Even an elementary use of the log will give you important information about your procrastination patterns and inner dialogue. You will want to include as basic information the day and time that you procrastinated, the activity you postponed and its priority, your thoughts and feelings about the task, your reason for procrastinating, the type of procrastination you used, your attempts at reducing anxiety, and your resultant thoughts and feelings. Alert you to the types of situations in which you are most likely to procrastinate: • detail activities (example #1): income tax, balancing the checkbook, arranging files, sorting customer records • home chores (example #2): fixing the screen door, cleaning out the basement, clearing the desk, painting the bedroom • performance tasks (example #3): giving a speech, presenting your product, confronting an employee • big or dense projects (example #4): preparing a legal brief, an advertising campaign, or a training manual These feelings, and the attitudes that cause them, get in the way of efficiently completing difficult tasks. Examples: • others are making you do something against your will - doing your income tax in #1 and fixing the screen door in #2 • pressure from yourself to give a perfect performance, as in activity #3, giving a speech • fear of mistakes and criticism - as in #4, appearing before the judge unprepared Identify the fears and pressures you typically associate with certain types of projects. You are often the one who raises the board off the ground by changing a straightforward task into a test of your worth. You are the one who confuses just doing the job with testing your worth. Situation A: walk a solid board Situation B: now the board is 100 feet above ground Situation C: The building supporting your end of the board is on fire! A small child is on the other side crying for your help. Now that you have pressure, doing it any old way you can. Note how many times successful people suffer through catastrophes and bankruptcies. The successful person fails many times and bounces back; but “The Failure” fails once, letting that one failure become a judgment of his or her worth. “I should do it,” such statements loudly communicate to the mind, “I don’t want to do it, but I must force myself to do it for them.” “should’s” do not communicate to the mind and body a clear picture of: • what you choose to do • when you choose to do it • where you choose to start it • how you choose to do it Focuses on results rather than blame. Precisely because you have chosen to do it, it becomes less difficult, less painful, and more quickly accomplished. Whenever you catch yourself losing motivation on a project, look for the implicit “have to” in your thinking and make a decision at that moment to embrace the path - as it is, not the way you think it should be - or let go of it. It’s your choice. The phrase “I have to” (meaning “I have to, but I don’t want to”) will give you a sense of ambivalence and victimization (“I have to, but if I were powerful I wouldn’t”) This is very important. This project has to impress everyone. This is my one big chance in life.” The bigger and more overwhelming the project seems to you, the greater your tendency to procrastinate.",Good book with insights and advice on overcoming procrastination.
Mastery,Robert Greene,0670024961,5,"Thinking can be slow, and in its slowness can become ineffective. So much of our obsessive, internal thought process tends to disconnect us from the world. Intuitive powers at the mastery level are a mix of the instinctive and the rational. Mirror neurons: the ability to think inside everything around, make decisions rapidly and effectively, having gained a complete understanding of their environment. When we take our time and focus in depth, when we trust that going through a process of months or years will bring us mastery, we work with the grain of this marvelous instrument that developed over so many millions of years. We dismiss our thoughts without notice, because they are ours. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts. A quality that is genetic and inborn - not talent or brilliance, but rather a deep and powerful inclination toward a particular subject. This inclination is a reflection of a person’s uniqueness. Desire, patience, persistence, and confidence end up playing a much larger role in success than sheer reasoning powers. Feeling motivated and energized, we can overcome almost anything. Feeling bored and restless, our minds shut off and we become increasingly passive. The moment that you rest, thinking that you have attained the level you desire, a part of your mind enters a phase of decay. You lose your hard-earned creativity and others begin to sense it. This is a power and intelligence that must be continually renewed or it will die. “Geniuses” all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well. Leonardo da Vinci: His mind worked best when he had several different projects at hand, allowing him to build all kinds of connections between them. He didn’t care so much about the finished product; it was the search and process in creating something that had always excited him. Your Life’s Task is to express your uniqueness through your work. You have a destiny to fulfill. The stronger you feel and maintain it - as a force, a voice, or in whatever form - the greater your chance for fulfilling this Life’s Task and achieving mastery. What weakens this force, what makes you not feel it or even doubt its existence, is the degree to which you have succumbed to another force in life - social pressures to conform. Your desire and interest slowly wane and your work suffers for it. You come to see pleasure and fulfillment as something that comes from outside your work. Because you are increasingly less engaged in your career, you fail to pay attention to changes going on in the field - you fall behind the times and pay a price for this. At moments when you must make important decisions, you flounder or follow what others are doing because you have no sense of inner direction or radar to guide you. You have broken contact with your destiny. You are your own Master. Equality, which we mistake for the need for everyone to be the same, is really the equal chance for people to express their differences. You must see your vocation as eminently poetic and inspiring. Connecting to your inclinations and Life’s Task requires a good deal of planning and strategizing. Deal with the main obstacles in your path: the voices of others infecting you, fighting over limited resources, choosing false paths, getting stuck in the past, and losing your way. In order to master a field, you must love the subject and feel a profound connection to it. Your interest must transcend the field itself and border on the religious. Return to your origins: For Einstein, it was not physics but a fascination with invisible forces that governed the universe. For Bergman, it was not film but the sensation of creating and animating life. For Coltrane, it was not music but giving voice to powerful emotions. These childhood attractions are hard to put into words and are more like sensations. An attraction that is not infected by the desires of other people - a desire to repeat an activity that you never tired of. The more people there are crowded into a space, the harder it becomes to thrive there. Working in such a field will tend to wear you out as you struggle to get attention, to play the political games, to win scarce resources for yourself. You spend so much time at these games that you have little time left over for true mastery. You are seduced into such fields because you see others there. Instead, find a niche in the ecology that you can dominate. Actively rebel against those forces that have pushed you away from your true path. If you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by. (suicide:) You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. You are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others. People suffered more from sameness than from nonconformity. Learn the lessons and follow the path established by the greatest Masters - a kind of Ideal Apprenticeship that transcends all fields. In the process you will master the necessary skills, discipline your mind, and transform yourself into an independent thinker, prepared for the creative challenges on the way to mastery. The goal of an apprenticeship is the transformation of your mind and character. Transform yourself from someone who is impatient and scattered into someone who is disciplined and focused, with a mind that can handle complexity. Constantly look for challenges, pushing yourself past your comfort zone. Use danger and difficulties as a way to measure progress. Three essential steps in your apprenticeship, each one overlapping the other: Deep Observation (The Passive Mode) Skills Acquisition (The Practice Mode) Experimentation (The Active Mode) The greatest mistake you can make in the initial months of your apprenticeship is to imagine that you have to get attention, impress people, and prove yourself. Keep in the background as much as possible, remaining passive and giving yourself the space to observe. Enter a cycle of accelerated returns in which the practice becomes easier and more interesting, leading to the ability to practice for longer hours, which increases your skill level, which in turn makes practice even more interesting. Reaching this cycle is the goal you must set for yourself. Begin with one skill that you can master, and that serves as a foundation for acquiring others. Avoid at all cost the idea that you can manage learning several skills at a time. You need to develop your powers of concentration, and understand that trying to multitask will be the death of the process. The pain and boredom we experience in the initial stage of learning a skill toughens our minds, much like physical exercise. This process of hardwiring cannot occur if you are constantly distracted, moving from one task to another. Gain as much feedback as possible from others, to have standards against which you can measure your progress so that you are aware of how far you have to go. When you practice and develop any skill, you transform yourself. Your sense of pleasure becomes redefined. What offers immediate pleasure comes to seem like a distraction, an empty entertainment to help pass the time. Real pleasure comes from overcoming challenges, feeling confidence in your abilities, gaining fluency in skills, and experiencing the power this brings. Find a way to work with your hands, or to learn more about the inner workings of the machines and pieces of technology around you. What prevents people from learning is a sense of smugness and superiority whenever we encounter something alien to our ways, as well as rigid ideas about what is real or true. Children are dependent upon adults for their survival and naturally feel inferior. This sense of inferiority gives them a hunger to learn. Through learning, they can bridge the gap and not feel so helpless. Their minds are completely open; they pay greater attention. This is why children can learn so quickly and so deeply. Go in the opposite direction of all of your natural tendencies when it comes to practice. Resist the temptation to be nice to yourself. Give precedence to the elements you are not good at. Resist the lure of easing up on your focus. Train yourself to concentrate in practice with double the intensity, as if it were the real thing times two. Invent exercises that work upon your weaknesses. Give yourself arbitrary deadlines. Develop your own standards for excellence, generally higher than those of others. To an entrepreneurial venture, mistakes and failures are precisely your means of education. They tell you about your own inadequacies. It is hard to find out such things from people, as they are often political with their praise and criticisms. Your failures also permit you to see the flaws of your ideas, which are only revealed in the execution of them. You learn what your audience really wants, the discrepancy between your ideas and how they affect the public. Pay close attention to the structure of your group - how your team is organized, the degree of independence you have from the source of capital. These are design elements as well, and such management issues are often hidden sources of problems. To apprentice as an entrepreneur you must act on your ideas as early as possible, exposing them to the public, a part of you even hoping that you’ll fail. Study as deeply as possible the technology we use, the functioning of the group we work in, the economics of our field, its lifeblood. When we learn something in a concentrated manner, we experience fewer distractions. What we learn is internalized more deeply because of the intensity of our focus and practice. Our own ideas and development flourish more naturally in this shortened time frame. Nostalgia for the intensity with which we used to experience the world: As the years pass, this intensity inevitably diminishes. We come to see the world through a screen of words and opinions; our prior experiences, layered over the present, color what we see. We no longer look at things as they are, noticing their details, or wonder why they exist. Our minds gradually tighten up. Ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over, but have the rigor and discipline to follow your investigations all the way to the end. The human mind is naturally creative, constantly looking to make associations and connections between things and ideas. It wants to explore, to discover new aspects of the world, and to invent. To express this creative force is our greatest desire, and the stifling of it the source of our misery. What kills the creative force is not age or a lack of talent, but our own spirit, our own attitude. To think more flexibly entails a risk - we could fail and be ridiculed. You must have faith that what you are doing will yield something important. The choice of where to direct creative energy makes the Master. Choose something that appeals to your sense of unconventionality and calls up latent feelings of rebelliousness. In opting for something that has deep personal appeal to you, you will naturally move in an unorthodox direction. Try to ally this with a desire to subvert conventional paradigms and go against the grain. Strategies to loosen up the mind: feel doubt and uncertainty for as long as possible. Your thoughts will be more real than if you had jumped to conclusions and formed judgments early. Confirmation bias: what you will often end up expressing is an opinion rather than a truthful observation about reality. The need for certainty is the greatest disease the mind faces. Suspend the need to judge everything. Adopt a kind of humility toward knowledge. Negative Capability should not be a permanent state of mind. In order to produce work of any sort we must create limits on what we’ll consider; we must organize our thoughts into relatively cohesive patterns, and eventually, come up with conclusions. In the end, we must make certain judgments. Negative Capability is a tool we use in the process to open the mind up temporarily to more possibilities. Once this way of thinking leads to a creative avenue of thought, we can give our ideas a clearer shape and gently let it go, returning to this attitude whenever we feel stale or blocked. The essence of the creative mind: every stimulus that enters the brain is processed, turned over, and reevaluated. Nothing is taken at face value. Perception itself becomes a stimulating exercise in thinking. If we had failed to speculate on the meaning of what we had observed, we simply would have had an observation that led us nowhere. If we had speculated without continuing to observe and verify, then we simply would have had some random idea floating in our heads. But by continually cycling between speculation and observation/experiment, we are able to pierce deeper and deeper into reality. Become aware of the typical patterns your mind falls into and how you can break out of these patterns and alter your perspective. Anomalies themselves contain the richest information. They often reveal to us the flaws in our paradigms and open up new ways of looking at the world. Focus your attention on some need that is not currently being met, on what is absent. This requires more thinking and is harder to conceptualize. Emotions influence how you perceive the world. If you feel afraid, you tend to see more of the potential dangers in some action. If you feel particularly bold, you tend to ignore the potential risks. Alter your mental perspective, but reverse your emotional one as well. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of resistance and setbacks in your work, try to see this as in fact something that is quite positive and productive. These difficulties will make you tougher and more aware of the flaws you need to correct. If you see setbacks as opportunities, you are more likely to make that a reality. Language locks you into certain forms of logic and ways of thinking. If there are no words for certain concepts, you tend to not think of them. When you attempt to sketch something you must observe it closely, gaining a feel through our fingers of how to bring it to life. Such practice can help you think in visual terms and free your mind from its constant verbalizations. Detect flaws and difficulties in your original idea that you had not foreseen. Lesser types would simply give up or settle for what they have - a mediocre and half-realized project. But Masters understand that they must plow forward, and that the frustration, or the feeling of being blocked, has a purpose. The feeling that we have endless time to complete our work has an insidious and debilitating effect on our minds. Our attention and thoughts become diffused. Our lack of intensity makes it hard for the brain to jolt into a higher gear. The connections do not occur. For this purpose you must always try to work with deadlines, whether real or manufactured. Every day represents an intense challenge, and every morning you wake up with original ideas and associations to push you along. Our work is now more public and highly scrutinized. We might have the most brilliant ideas and a mind capable of handling the greatest intellectual challenges, but if we are not careful, we will tumble into emotional pitfalls. We will grow insecure, overly anxious about people’s opinions, or excessively self-confident. Or we will become bored and lose a taste for the hard work that is always necessary. Once we fall into these traps it is hard to extricate ourselves. The six most common pitfalls: Complacency: Fight this by upholding the value of active wonder. Constantly remind yourself of how little you truly know, and of how mysterious the world remains. Conservatism: You begin to fall in love with the ideas and strategies that worked for you in the past. You also will have a reputation to protect. Creativity is by its nature an act of boldness and rebellion. The world is dying for bolder ideas. As the creative spark leaves you, you will find yourself clutching even more forcefully to dead ideas, past successes, and the need to maintain your status. Make creativity rather than comfort your goal. Dependency: Internalize the voice of your Master so that you become both teacher and pupil. Impatience: You will convince yourself that your work is essentially over and well done, when really it is your impatience speaking. You will veer toward repetition - reusing the same ideas and processes as a kind of shortcut. Cultivate a kind of pleasure in pain - like an athlete, you come to enjoy rigorous practice, pushing past your limits, and resisting the easy way out. Grandiosity: Praise generally does harm. Slowly, the emphasis shifts from the joy of the creative process to the love of attention. We alter and shape our work to attract the praise that we crave. What must ultimately motivate you is the work itself and the process. Public attention is actually a nuisance and a distraction. Inflexibility: You must regularly doubt that you have achieved your goal and subject your work to intensive self-criticism. Avoid emotional extremes and find a way to feel optimism and doubt at the same time. The greatest impediment to creativity is your impatience, the almost inevitable desire to hurry up the process, express something, and make a splash. Read journals and books from all different fields. Sometimes you will find an interesting anomaly in an unrelated discipline that may have implications for your own. You must keep your mind completely open - no item is too small or unimportant to escape your attention. If an apparent anomaly calls into question your own beliefs or assumptions, so much the better. You must speculate on what it could mean. If what you have discovered seems to have profound ramifications, you must pursue it with the utmost intensity. Better to look into ten such facts, with only one yielding a great discovery, than to look into twenty ideas that bring success but have trivial implications. Wright Brothers: Two men from a completely different background. For them, the pleasure and excitement of design was in doing everything themselves. Their model depended not on superior technology, but on the highest number of test runs, creating an optimal learning curve. This revealed flaws to be worked on and gave them a feel for the product that could never be had in the abstract. Whatever you are creating or designing, you must test and use it yourself. Separating out the work will make you lose touch with its functionality. Have wide knowledge of your field and other fields, giving your brain more possible associations and connections. Cultivate profound dissatisfaction with your work and the need to constantly improve. The longer you can allow the project to absorb your mental energies, the richer it will become. For creative types: Begin by looking inward. Something you want to express that is unique. Not something that is sparked by some trend. A sound you are not hearing in music, a type of story not being told. A new way of doing business. Play against the very conventions that you find dead and want to get rid of. Following this strategy will give your work a kind of reverse reference point. Think of the overall purpose of your work, of the larger question at hand. Thinking on such a high level frees the mind up to investigate from all different angles. The microprocessors that made the microcomputer possible had originally been developed to run traffic lights and vending machines. They had never been intended to power computers. The first entrepreneurs to attempt this were laughed at; the computers they had created looked hardly worthy of the name - they were so small and could do so little. The peculiar process that led to these inventions: generally, the inventors had a chance encounter with the available technology; then the idea would come to them that this technology could be used for other purposes; and finally they would try out different prototypes until the right one fell into place. What allows for this process is the willingness of the inventor to look at everyday things in a different light and to imagine new uses for them. We come upon something by accident. This accidental encounter will spark some interesting associations and ideas in us. Actively explore the unconscious and contradictory parts of your personality, and to examine similar contradictions and tensions in the world at large. These contradictions contain a rich mine of information about a reality that is deeper and more complex than the one immediately perceived. After some 20,000 hours, Masters thus have a sense of how everything interacts organically, and they can intuit patterns or solutions in an instant. Make our years of study qualitatively rich. We don’t simply absorb information - we internalize it and make it our own by finding some way to put this knowledge to practical use. Intuition, primitive or high level, is essentially driven by memory. When we take in information of any kind, we store it in mnemonic networks in the brain. The stability and durability of these networks depends on repetition, intensity of experience, and how deeply we pay attention. This desire for what is simple and easy infects all of us, often in ways we are mostly unaware of. The only solution is the following: We must learn how to quiet the anxiety we feel whenever we are confronted with anything that seems complex or chaotic. In our journey from apprenticeship to mastery we must patiently learn the various parts and skills that are required, never looking too far ahead. We must do whatever we can to cultivate a greater memory capacity - one of the most important skills in our technologically oriented environment. Take up hobbies - a game, a musical instrument, a foreign language - that bring pleasure but also offer you the chance to strengthen your memory capacities. To become such sensitive observers, you must not succumb to all of the distractions afforded by technology. It is easy to become enamored with the powers that technology affords us, and to see them as the end and not the means. The Ideal of the Universal Man - a person so steeped in all forms of knowledge that his mind grows closer to the reality of nature itself and sees secrets that are invisible to most people.","Mostly detailed historical biographical tales of ”masters” like DaVinci, Darwin, Mozart, Proust, Goethe, Wright Brothers, Einstein, Coltrane, Martha Graham, etc. Lessons dissected from their successes, and categorized. Similar format to his great book “48 Laws of Power”, but a little less effective here. The biographies were interesting, but lessons were mostly conventional wisdom."
Meditation for Beginners,Jack Kornfield,1591799422,5,"To learn any important skill - whether it is playing the piano or meditation - it grows with perseverance, patience, and systematic training. Develop a stillness in the midst of activity. A way of being that we can carry with us every moment of our days. Relax with uncertainty. Mindfulness: a caring and respectful attention. You do not have to fear that which is painful, and you do not have to grasp for that which is pleasant. Open-hearted, and non-judgmental awareness of our bodies and our feelings. See more clearly the people we live with. A spiritual warrior’s life is an endless challenge, and challenges cannot possibly be good or bad. The basic difference between an ordinary person and a warrior is that a warrior takes everything as a challenge, while an ordinary person takes everything as a blessing or a curse. Just learning to be kind. What was necessary for a contemplative life was “a cup of understanding, a barrel of love, and an ocean of patience.” Live more in the present moment and less and less in the place of forgetfulness or fantasy or memory. If you experience itching, instead of immediately scratching the itch, you can simply note “itching, itching, itching.” Maybe for the first time in your life you can acknowledge the itch and feel what it is like and give it space to tingle and itch for some time without scratching it. Then you will also notice how it eventually passes away. This is true of every body sensation - whether it is coolness, or warmth, or tension, or pain. A fly landed on my face. My first impulse was to brush the fly away. The fly stayed for at least ten minutes. During those ten minutes I was not planning, and I was not worrying about anything else. I was more present and centered and concentrated than if I had gone to a monastery for a month. Even if you get what you think you want, it does not stop. It is always something that we do not have in the present moment - something that we want to obtain in order to satisfy our longing. You are not going to try to fulfill your desire, but you are going to sit and feel it and see its nature. You will watch it arise, you will feel what it is like in your body, and you will name it. Eventually it will pass away, and then you will see the next thing rise up. You will begin to see desire’s impermanent nature, and you will also realize that you do not have to act on every thought or desire. Whatever it is saying this time, it is always just the wanting mind. You have a choice: Will you get up? Sometimes getting up may be the right thing to do, and at other times you will recognize the qualities of the wanting mind and find a way not to have to follow it every time it arises. Aversion, anger, or fear, the aspects of mind that judge or push away our experiences. This includes judgment, which is also a kind of aversion: “That is bad. You are doing it wrong.” Aversion and judgment also include fear: “I do not want to feel this. I do not like this.” All of these are states of resistance. Right before anger arises, there is often a sense of hurt or fear or loss. When you can feel that, you can notice how little compassion or kindness you have for yourself and others. There is the judging mind. Everyone has one. He was bragging that he had once caused a whole tribe of Bedouins to run. His friend asked him how the Mullah alone had made a whole tribe of wild bloodthirsty Bedouins do this. Nasrudin said, “It was simple. I ran and they all ran after me.” This is the way that fear works. The farther we run, the faster the fear comes to find us. What makes these states so powerful is our resistance to them. But the moment you accept them, they lose a lot of their power. It is the resistance to them that makes them so difficult. Thoughts do not last very long. Thoughts come quickly. Thoughts generally last just a few seconds. Body sensations tend to be a little slower. Moods are in the middle. When sounds arise and interrupt you - like a loud car or someone coughing - then you can note those as “hearing, hearing.” It is important not to create a story about whether they are good or bad noises The stories aren’t real - that each is a story that we insist on telling ourselves for a variety of reasons, but it is not what is happening in the moment. So we acknowledge the story as “remembering” or “planning”. If it keeps coming back, it is often a signal that something wants to be felt or accepted. So if the thought keeps returning again and again, there is maybe a loss that needs to be acknowledged, or a love that wants to be accepted, or some creativity that wants to be recognized and honored in some way. When we forgive others, we are able to release the past and start life anew. Without forgiveness, we are always left with “who did what to whom,” repeating the cycle.",Just some nice thoughts on meditation.
Linchpin,Seth Godin,1591843162,5,"A genius looks at something that others are stuck on and gets the world unstuck. Start giving gifts that change people. During times of change, the very last people you need on your team are well-paid bureaucrats, note takers, literalists. The compliant masses don’t help so much when you don’t know what to do next. What we must have are indispensable human beings. We need original thinkers, provocateurs, and people who care. If you make your business possible to replicate, you’re not going to be the one to replicate it. Others will. If you build a business filled with rules and procedures that are designed to allow you to hire cheap people, you will have to produce a product without humanity or personalization or connection. Which means that you’ll have to lower your prices to compete. Which leads to a race to the bottom. Indispensable businesses race to the top instead. Win by being more ordinary, more standard, and cheaper. Or win by being faster, more remarkable, and more human. It’s factory work because it’s planned, controlled, and measured. It’s factory work because you can optimize for productivity. These workers know what they’re going to do all day—and it’s still morning. If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it. If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper. The only way to get what you’re worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about. Gifts not only satisfy our needs as artists, they also signal to the world that we have plenty more to share. Five traits that are essential in how people look at us: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extra-version, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability. Sandy Pentland is a researcher and professor at MIT. His latest work involves the ways that humans figure out what is really happening around them. His new book, Honest Signals, is named after his term for information that flows back and forth between people. We have everything we need, so we’re not buying commodities. We’re not even buying products. We’re buying relationships and stories and magic. Near the beginning of most comics was a scene where a stranger would meet the team. Inevitably, the heroes would introduce themselves. Of course, Batman or Superman wouldn’t need an introduction, but the lesser (lower-rent) heroes had to speak up and describe their superpowers. “I’m the Wasp. I have the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and fire energy blasts.” Some fancy marketers might call this a positioning statement or a unique selling proposition. Of course, it’s not that. It’s a superpower. When you meet someone, you need to have a superpower. If you don’t, you’re just another handshake. It’s not about touting yourself or coming on too strong. It’s about making the introduction meaningful. If I don’t know your superpower, then I don’t know how you can help me (or I can help you). When what you do is what you love, you’re able to invest more effort and care and time. That means you’re more likely to win, to gain share, to profit. On the other hand, poets don’t get paid. Even worse, poets who try to get paid end up writing jingles and failing and hating it at the same time. Attention doesn’t always equal significant cash flow. I think it makes sense to make your art your art, to give yourself over to it without regard for commerce. Maybe you can’t make money doing what you love (at least what you love right now). But I bet you can figure out how to love what you do to make money (if you choose wisely). Do your art. But don’t wreck your art if it doesn’t lend itself to paying the bills. That would be a tragedy. -- John Jantsch took an interview he did with me (about forty minutes of audio) and posted it to a site that uses the Turk as its labor. For just a few dollars, the site took the recording, chopped it into tiny bits, and parceled it out to anonymous laborers who each transcribed their little section. Less than three hours later, it was sewn back together and the typed transcript was delivered to John. Instead of paying the industry rate of two dollars a minute (about eighty dollars), services like CastingWords do transcription for less than fifty cents a minute using the Turk.","For someone who has a job at a company, I would call this essential reading with my highest recommendation. Since I haven't had a job since 1992, I couldn't apply many of his great points to my life. Still I loved his reminder of the value of the brilliant workers instead of systemized workers. The opposite of E-Myth (another book reviewed here)."
Cognitive Surplus,Clay Shirky,1594202532,5,"Gin consumption was treated as the problem to be solved, when it fact it was a reaction to the real problem - dramatic social change and the inability of older civic models to adapt. What helped the Gin Craze subside was the restructuring of society around the new urban realities. Milkshake Mistakes: (Story about McDonalds consultant not understanding why so many people bought only milkshakes in the morning: because it was breakfast for them. Just because milkshakes weren't meant for breakfast they hadn't considered that.) The first was to concentrate mainly on the product and assume that everything important about it was somehow implicit in its attributes, without regard to what role the customers wanted it to play - the job they were hiring the milkshake for. The second mistake was to adopt a narrow view of the type of food people have always eaten in the morning, as if all habits were deeply rooted traditions instead of accumulated accidents. Neither the shake itself nor the history of breakfast mattered as much as customers needing food to do a nontraditional job - serve as sustenance and amusement for their morning commute - for which they hired the milkshake. When we talk about the effects of the web or text messages, it’s easy to make a milkshake mistake and focus on the tools themselves. It’s also easy to assume that the world as it currently exists represents some sort of ideal expression of society, and that all deviations from this sacred tradition are both shocking and bad. But pure consumption of media was never a sacred tradition; it was just a set of accumulated accidents, accidents that are being undone The story of Ushahidi holds several different lessons: People want to do something to make the world a better place. They will help when they are invited to. Access to cheap, flexible tools removes many of the barriers to trying new things. You don’t need fancy computers to harness cognitive surplus; simple phones are enough. Once you’ve figured out how to tap the surplus in a way that people care about, others can replicate your technique, over and over, around the world. Anyone seeing a lolcat gets a second, related message: You can play this game too. Precisely because lolcats are so transparently created. The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act. As long as the assumed purpose of media is to allow ordinary people to consume professionally created material, the proliferation of amateur-created stuff will seem incomprehensible. But what if, all this time, providing professional content isn’t the only job we’ve been hiring media to do? What if we’ve also been hiring it to make us feel connected, engaged, or just less lonely? The sharing, in fact, is what makes the making fun. Grown men and women sitting in their basements pretending to be elves: at least they’re doing something. To participate is to act as if your presence matters, as if, when you see something or hear something, your response is part of the event. Participation is inherent in the phone, and it’s the same for the computer. When you buy a machine that lets you consume digital content, you also buy a machine to produce it. If you offer people the opportunity to produce and to share, they’ll sometimes take you up on it, even if they’ve never behaved that way before and even if they’re not as good at it as the pros. The likelihood of an event is the probability of it happening times the frequency with which it might happen. Where I grew up, the chance that someone would want a single slice of pizza at three in the afternoon was too low to take a chance on. At the corner of Thirty-fourth Street and Sixth Avenue, on the other hand, you could build a whole business on those odds. Any human event, however improbable, sees its likelihood grow in a crowd. Big surpluses are different from small ones. More is different: When you aggregate a lot of something, it behaves in new ways. What are the chances that a person with a camera will come across an event of global significance? We are increasingly becoming one another’s infrastructure. We increasingly learn about the world through strangers’ random choices about what to share. The worst thing that could possibly happen to anybody would be to not be used for anything by anybody. Media is the middle layer in any communication, whether it is as ancient as the alphabet or as recent as mobile phones. The wiring of humanity lets us treat free time as a shared global resource, and lets us design new kinds of participation and sharing that take advantage of that resource. Because we have to coordinate with one another to get anything out of our shared free time and talents. The cognitive surplus, newly forged from previously disconnected islands of time and talent, is just raw material. To get any value out of it, we have to make it mean or do things. PickupPal provides parallels our cognitive surplus in general. When each person has to solve the commuting problem entirely on their own, the solution is each person owning and driving their own car. But this “solution” makes the problem worse. Once we see the problem of commuting as a matter of coordination, however, we can think of aggregate solutions rather than just individual ones. In the context of carpooling, the number of cars on the road becomes an opportunity, because each additional car is an additional chance that someone will be going your way. PickupPal reimagines the surplus of cars and drivers as a potentially shared resource. A lot of new kinds of media have emerged since Gutenberg: images and sounds were encoded onto objects, from photographic plates to music CDs; electromagnetic waves were harnessed to create radio and TV. All these subsequent revolutions, as different as they were, still had the core of Gutenberg economics: enormous investment costs. It’s expensive to own the means of production, whether it is a printing press or a TV tower, which makes novelty a fundamentally high-risk operation. If it’s expensive to own and manage the means of production or if it requires a staff, you’re in a world of Gutenberg economics. And wherever you have Gutenberg economics, whether you are a Venetian publisher or a Hollywood producer, you’re going to have fifteenth-century risk management as well, where the producers have to decide what’s good before showing it to the audience. In this world almost all media was produced by “the media,” a world we all lived in up until a few years ago. Publishers still perform other functions in selecting, editing, and marketing work (dozens of people besides me have worked to improve this book, for example), but they no longer form the barrier between private and public writing. Publicity, publicize, publish, publication, publicist, publisher. They are all centered on the act of making something public, which has historically been difficult, complex, and expensive. And now it is none of those things. The easier it is for the average person to publish, the more average what gets published becomes. But increasing freedom to participate in the public conversation has compensating values. The first advantage is an increase of experimentation in form. Even though the spread of movable type created a massive downshift in average quality, that same invention made it possible to have novels, newspapers, and scientific journals. Abundance is different: its advent means we can start treating previously valuable things as if they were cheap enough to waste, which is to say cheap enough to experiment with. Because abundance can remove the trade-offs we’re used to, it can be disorienting to the people who’ve grown up with scarcity. When a resource is scarce, the people who manage it often regard it as valuable in itself, without stopping to consider how much of the value is tied to its scarcity. For years after the price of long-distance phone calls collapsed in the United States, my older relatives would still announce that a call was “long distance.” Such calls had previously been special, because they were expensive; it took people years to understand that cheap long-distance calls removed the rationale for regarding them as inherently valuable. Similarly, when publication - the act of making something public - goes from being hard to being virtually effortless, people used to the old system often regard publishing by amateurs as frivolous, as if publishing was an inherently serious activity. It never was, though. Publishing had to be taken seriously when its cost and effort made people take it seriously. An activity that once seemed inherently valuable turned out to be only accidentally valuable. By 1951 the answer was plain to see. The public had no need to choose between a flood of trash and a growing collection of classics. We could have both (which is what we got). Not only was “both” the answer to Swados’s question; it has always been the answer whenever communications abundance increases, from the printing press on. We can’t have “an ever-expanding list of classics” without also trying new forms; if there was an easy formula for writing something that will become prized for decades or centuries, we wouldn’t need experimentation, but there isn’t, so we do. The low-quality material that comes with increased freedom accompanies the experimentation that creates the stuff we will end up prizing. All revolutions are different (which is only to say that all surprises are surprising). Media is the connective tissue of society. Media is how you know when and where your friend’s birthday party is. Media is how you know what’s happening in Tehran, who’s in charge in Tegucigalpa, or the price of tea in China. Media is how you know about anything more than ten yards away. All these things used to be separated into public media (like visual or print communications made by a small group of professionals) and personal media (like letters and phone calls made by ordinary citizens). Now those two modes have fused. When someone buys a TV, the number of consumers goes up by one, but the number of producers stays the same. On the other hand, when someone buys a computer or a mobile phone, the number of consumers and producers both increase by one. With the new services, which enable amateurs to share work, the revenue goes not to the content creators but to the owners of the platform that enables the sharing. Consider, as an alternative comparison, a local bar. It’s a commercial operation, but the products it sells are invariably cheaper at home, often by a considerable margin; much of the service offered by the staff amounts to opening bottles and washing dishes. If a beer costs twice as much from a bar as it does from a store, why doesn’t the whole business just collapse as people opt for cheaper beer at home? Like the owners of YouTube, the bar owner is in the curious business of offering value above the products and services he sells, value that is created by the customers for one another. People pay more to have a beer in a bar than they do at home because a bar is a more convivial place to have a drink; it draws in people who are seeking a little conversation or just want to be around other people, people who prefer being in the bar to being home alone. This inducement is powerful enough that the difference is worth paying for. The digital sharecropper logic would suggest that the bar owner is exploiting his customers, because their conversations in the bar are part of the “content” that makes them willing to overpay for the beer, but none of the customers actually feels that way. Instead, they willingly reward the owner for creating a socially welcoming environment, a place where they will pay extra for the chance to associate with one another. Amateurs aren’t just pint-sized professionals. One function of the market, in other words, is to provide platforms for us to engage in the things we value doing outside the market, whether those platforms are bars or websites. (The past:) If you were a citizen of that world, and you had something you needed to say in public, you couldn’t. Period. The choice for the police had previously been Should we tell the public something or nothing? By 2005, it had become Do we want to be part of the conversation the public is already having? Extrinsic motivation like being paid can crowd out an intrinsic one like enjoying something for its own sake. Hypothetical government proposal to site nuclear waste storage in their region, were split about equally on the question. When Frey rephrased the question to include the possibility that the government would pay the citizens for housing the waste, however, they shifted to three to one against the proposal. How many places are there where someone’s free choice of activities matters much to anyone but the individual? In an age when our free time and talents are joint resources, the answer is “Everywhere.” A study of video games concluded that the principal draw for the players was not graphics and gore but the feelings of control and competence the players could attain as they mastered the game. Verbal rewards for completing Soma configurations like “That’s very good” or “That’s much better than average for this configuration” produced improvements in performance, improvements that persisted even after the verbal feedback ended. Verbal feedback seems like it should be just another extrinsic reward, like money. When it is genuine, though, and comes from someone the recipient respects, it becomes an intrinsic reward, because it relies on a sense of connectedness. Something designed by an amateur can actually create better conditions of membership than a professional design can, in the same way lolcats sends the message You can play this game too. You likely wouldn’t dare set foot in a House Beautiful kitchen, because the design doesn’t exactly scream Come on in and help! Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others. Amateurs are sometimes separated from professionals by skill, but always by motivation; the term itself derives from the Latin amare - “to love.” The essence of amateurism is intrinsic motivation: to be an amateur is to do something for the love of it. Digital folk art - the amateur production of words, sounds, and images designed to be engaging or amusing and intended for amateur circulation rather than inclusion in any formal publication. Go to a newsstand and buy a magazine on a subject you care nothing about. If you read Vogue, get Guns and Ammo; if you read Golf Digest, pick up Tiger Beat; and as you read, imagine what someone who liked that magazine would think about your interests. Creators are looking not to reach some generic audience but rather to communicate with their soul mates, often within a sense of shared cultural norms that differ from those of the outside world. If you only pretend to offer an outlet for those motivations, while actually slotting people into a scripted experience, they may well revolt. When a surprising new thing happens, instead of asking Why is this new? we can ask Why is it a surprise? Many of the unexpected uses of communications tools are surprising because our old beliefs about human nature were so lousy. Theory-induced blindness: adherence to a belief about how the world works that prevents you from seeing how the world really works. A surprise, in other words, is the feeling of an old belief breaking. Many of our behaviors are like memorizing phone numbers, held in place not by desire but by inconvenience, and they’re quick to disappear when the inconvenience does. Getting news from a piece of paper, having to be physically near a television at a certain time to see a certain show, keeping our vacation pictures to ourselves as if they were some big secret - not one of these behaviors made a lick of sense. Every surprising bit of new behavior described here has two common elements: people had the opportunity to behave in a way that rewarded some intrinsic motivation, and those opportunities were enabled by technology but created by human beings. Those bits of new behavior, though, are extensions of, rather than replacements for, much older patterns of our lives as social creatures. That network of California skateboarders created an environment where people who liked skateboarding could get better at it together. A sense of membership, of belonging to a group that is animated by a shared vision or project, can spark a feedback loop in which autonomy and competence improve as well. People who are part of a network where they become better at something they love tend to stay. As the group’s ability to learn and work together gets stronger, it attracts more participants. The hothouse environment of a collaborative circle can make the ideas and achievements of the participants develop faster than if the participants were all pursuing the identical goals without sharing. Behavioral economics is demonstrating that humans don’t always act in self-interested ways, and that transactions themselves have an emotional component. We are incapable of behaving as if we weren’t members of a larger society, and as if we didn’t gauge the effects of our actions with membership in that society in mind. One of the great bulwarks of ethical standards in a society is people’s willingness to punish others who defect from norms of fairness or good behavior, even when meting out that punishment costs them something. This is exactly what responders do in the Ultimatum Game when they reject low offers, and because society enjoys the benefits of this individually costly behavior, it is called altruistic punishment. People derive pleasure from punishing wrongdoing, even if it costs them time, energy, or money. Every mode of communication that once had to rely on market pricing can now have an alternative that relies on open sharing. When we assume people are principally selfish, we design systems that reward selfish people. Systems that assume people will act in ways that create public goods, and that give them opportunities and rewards for doing so, often let them work together better than neoclassical economics would predict. Social production: people you don’t know, making your life better for free The private sector, where a task will get done when the group to do it can be assembled and paid for less than their output will fetch in the market. Social production is the creation of value by a group for its members, using neither price signals nor managerial oversight to coordinate participants’ efforts. Commons-based peer production: work that is jointly owned or accessed by its participants, and created by people operating as peers, without a managerial hierarchy. One of the weakest notions in the entire pop culture canon is that of innate generational difference, the idea that today’s thirtysomethings are members of a class of people called Generation X while twentysomethings are part of Generation Y, and that both differ innately from each other and from the baby boomers. The conceptual appeal of these labels is enormous, but the idea’s explanatory value is almost worthless, a kind of astrology for decades instead of months. Generations do differ, but less because people differ than because opportunities do. Theories of generational difference make sense if they are expressed as theories of environmental difference rather than of psychological difference. The decision not to make someone else’s life better when it would cost you little or nothing has a name: spite. The music industry, in order to preserve its revenues, wanted (and still wants) all of us to be voluntarily spiteful to our friends. Positive deviants are those who behave better than the norm, even when faced with similar limitations or challenges. In 1973 Mark Granovetter showed in a seminal paper, “The Strength of Weak Ties,” that people tend to find jobs through casual acquaintances rather than through close friends or family. Putting a price on something previously outside of market logic can change it fundamentally. Prostitution: men are not only paying for sex, they are also paying the women to go away afterward. Invisible College had one big advantage over the alchemists: they had one another. The alchemists had failed uninformatively. As a group, the alchemists were notably reclusive; they typically worked alone, they were secretive about their methods and their results. Erroneous beliefs were as likely as correct ones to be preserved over generations. In contrast, members of the Invisible College described their methods, assumptions, and results to one another, so that all might benefit from both successes and failures. Open source aphorism: Good community plus bad code makes a good project. Learners who share their observations and frustrations with their peers learn faster and retain more of what they’ve learned than those who study alone. Managing inconvenience, big or small, often involves creating a particular class of worker. College professors, restaurant reviewers, librarians, and file clerks all help keep the inconvenience to manageable levels for everyone else. When things that used to be inconvenient stop being inconvenient, though, the old accommodations have to be renegotiated, including the role of those workers: when you can get advice about a restaurant from the aggregate view of people who’ve actually eaten there, the value of the critic as a source of recommendation is reduced. As more people come to expect that amateur participation is always an open option, those expectations can change the culture. We can now turn massive aggregations of small contributions into things of lasting value. This fact, key to our current era, has been a persistent surprise. At every turn, skeptical observers have attacked the idea that pooling our cognitive surplus could work to create anything worthwhile. The downside of attending to the emotional life of groups is that it can swamp the ability to get anything done; a group can become more concerned with satisfying its members than with achieving its goals. Members internalize the standards of the group and react to behavior that undermines those standards. (Over-trusting blogging girl was killed, backpacking:) They believed, wrongly, that human motivations are basically benign. The couch surfers, on the other hand, understood that some people have motivations to do harm, that this creates real risks, and that you have to mitigate those risks somehow. In a free culture, you get what you celebrate. Public value requires not just new opportunities for old motivations; it requires governance, which is to say ways of discouraging or preventing people from wrecking either the process or the product of the group. People will behave if they sense that there is long-term value in doing so, and short-term loss in not doing so. Voluntary groups need governance so that we can defend ourselves from ourselves; we need governance to create a space we can create in. Our best chance for finding good ideas is to have as many groups as possible try as many things as possible. The future doesn’t unfold on some preordained track; things change because someone figures out something that is possible right now, and pushes to make it happen. We’re lousy at predicting what we will do with new communications tools before we try them. Creating the most value from a tool involves not master plans or great leaps forward but constant trial and error. It’s easy to imagine a service that will be useful if a lot of people are using it. It’s hard to create a service that will be useful when only a few people are using it. Projects that will work only if they grow large generally won’t grow large. People who are fixated on creating large-scale future success can actually reduce the possibility of creating the small-scale here-and-now successes needed to get there. To get to a system that is large and good, it is far better to start with a system that is small and good and work on making it bigger. New ideas seem clearer and more obviously good to the founders and designers of a service than to potential users. Take a skeptical look at what the user gets out of participating, especially when the motivation of the designer differs from that of the user. Every social media user can already create any number of things online, whether it’s a piece of writing or a photo or a video, and they can join any number of online communities dedicated to discussion of things they care about. Given this riot of opportunity, you have to give your users a specific one that rewards their intrinsic motivations, preferably both personal ones (like autonomy and competence) and social ones (like membership and generosity). Default to Social Careful use of defaults can shape how users behave, because they communicate some expectation. Backflip concentrated on personal value and assumed social value was optional. Delicious, on the other hand, made social value the default. By assuming that users would be happy to create something of value for each other, Delicious grew quickly, since the social value attracted new users, and their subsequent use of the service created still more social value. Social systems have two modes - dynamic and dead. Once a culture is established, whether it’s helpful or suspicious, accepting or skeptical, it is very hard to change. The key is to recruit as the first dozens of users people who will embody the right cultural norms. Whatever culture has taken hold by the time you get to a hundred users has a good chance of remaining in force when you get to a thousand (or a million). A visible willingness to enforce the rules, in other words, actually reduces the amount of energy the people who run the train have to expend on policing, because the riders are willing to coordinate a response among themselves, knowing they can count on predictable support. The faster you learn, the sooner you’ll be able to adapt Success causes more problems than failure True long-term difficulties come from success, because successful services heighten expectations and attract people who want to take advantage of the goodwill of others (by doing things like sending spam) or see the project fail. Plan for such problems in advance, in order to be ready for them. If you want to solve hard problems, have hard problems. Defending yourself in advance against the possible ramifications of success has strong diminishing returns. As a general rule, it is more important to try something new, and work on the problems as they arise, than to figure out a way to do something new without having any problems. The task isn’t just to get something done, it’s to create an environment in which people want to do it. Solving the problems as they arise means not putting a process in place until you need it. Groups tolerate governance, which is by definition a set of restrictions, only after enough value has accumulated to make the burden worthwhile. Since that value builds up only over time, the burden of the rules has to follow, not lead. The single greatest predictor of how much value we get out of our cognitive surplus is how much we allow and encourage one another to experiment, because the only group that can try everything is everyone. What is the ideal way for a new technology to be integrated into society? Let’s divide this problem into a few different scenarios. 1- One would be “As Much Chaos as We Can Stand”: we let any would-be revolutionary try anything they like with the new technology, without regard for existing cultural or social norms or potential damage to current social institutions. 2- Another scenario would be “Traditionalist Approval”: the fate of any new technology would be put in the hands of the people responsible for the current way of doing things. It would be like leaving it up to the monks to decide how to use the printing press or to the post office to decide what to do with e-mail. 3- A third scenario - call it “Negotiated Transition” - assumes a balanced conversation between radicals and traditionalists: radicals can propose uses of the new technology, then negotiate with traditionalists about how to take advantage of the new while preserving the best of the old. The right answer is actually the first one, “As Much Chaos as We Can Stand.” When someone runs a bookstore, or a newspaper, or a TV station, it’s advantageous to have those people think of their work as being critical for society, even if it isn’t. This sort of commitment is good for morale and leads people to defend useful and valuable institutions. However, that intellectual asset turns into a liability in times of revolution precisely because those deeply committed to old solutions cannot see how society would benefit from an approach incompatible with older models. Paradoxically, as we have seen, people committed to solving a particular problem also commit themselves to maintaining that problem in order to keep their solution viable. We can’t ask people running traditional systems to evaluate a new technology for its radical benefits; people committed to keeping the current system will tend, as a group, to have trouble seeing value in anything disruptive. Radicals won’t be able to create any more change than the members of society can imagine. The upper limit of “As Much Chaos as We Can Stand” is thus the time and energy required for social diffusion. The radicals will be unable to correctly predict the eventual ramifications because they have an incentive to overstate the new system’s imagined value and because they will lack the capacity to imagine the other uses to which the tools will be put. Proponents of the new and defenders of the old can’t merely discuss the transition, because each group has systematic biases that make its overall vision untrustworthy; radicals and traditionalists start from different assumptions and usually end up talking past each other. The actual negotiated transition can happen only by letting the radicals try everything, because given their inability to predict what will happen, and given the natural braking functions of social diffusion, most of it will fail. The negotiation that matters isn’t between radicals and traditionalists; instead it has to be with the citizens of the larger society, the only group who can legitimately decide how they want to live, given the new range of possibilities. We’re looking for the mouse. We look everywhere a reader or a viewer or a patient or a citizen has been locked out of creating and sharing, or has been served up passive or canned experience.","I always love Clay Shirky's insights into the internet culture. This is about how all the spare time people are using to add to Wikipedia or create YouTube videos is previously time they were passively watching TV. Perhaps passive watching was a temporary habit that lasted 80 years, and now we're going back to a more participatory culture?"
The Selfish Gene,Richard Dawkins,0199291152,5,"I am saying how things have evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave. I stress this, because I know I am in danger of being misunderstood by people who cannot distinguish a statement of belief in what is the case from an advocacy of what ought to be the case. Evolution is blind to the future. The nation is a major beneficiary of our altruistic self-sacrifice, and young men are expected to die as individuals for the greater glory of their country as a whole. Moreover, they are encouraged to kill other individuals about whom nothing is known except that they belong to a different nation. There is the greatest scorn for those who have gone a little further in widening their altruism, so that it includes other species. If I say that I am more interested in preventing the slaughter of large whales than I am in improving housing conditions for people, I am likely to shock some of my friends. Lions and antelopes are both members of the class Mammalia, as are we. Should we then not expect lions to refrain from killing antelopes, ‘for the good of the mammals’? There is no need to think of design or purpose or directedness. If a group of atoms in the presence of energy falls into a stable pattern it will tend to stay that way. The earliest form of natural selection was simply a selection of stable forms and a rejection of unstable ones. There is no mystery about this. It had to happen by definition. The scholars of the Septuagint mistranslated the Hebrew word for ‘young woman’ into the Greek word for ‘virgin’, coming up with the prophecy: ‘Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son…’ Nothing actually ‘wants’ to evolve. Evolution is something that happens, willy-nilly, in spite of all the efforts of the replicators (and nowadays of the genes) to prevent it happening. Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp that words are only tools for our use, and that the mere presence in the dictionary of a word like ‘living’ does not mean it necessarily has to refer to something definite in the real world. Whether we call the early replicators living or not, they were the ancestors of life. What was to be the fate of the ancient replicators? They did not die out, for they are past masters of the survival arts. But do not look for them floating loose in the sea; they gave up that cavalier freedom long ago. Now they swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots, sealed off from the outside world, communicating with it by tortuous indirect routes, manipulating it by remote control. They are in you and in me; they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence. They have come a long way, those replicators. Now they go by the name of genes, and we are their survival machines. Every one of those cells contains a complete copy of that body’s DNA. This DNA can be regarded as a set of instructions for how to make a body, written in the ATCG alphabet of the nucleotides. It is as though, in every room of a gigantic building, there was a book-case containing the architect’s plans for the entire building. The ‘book-case’ in a cell is called the nucleus. The architect’s plans run to 46 volumes in man - the number is different in other species. The ‘volumes’ are called chromosomes. They are visible under a microscope as long threads, and the genes are strung out along them in order. But if the DNA is really a set of plans for building a body, how are the plans put into practice? How are they translated into the fabric of the body? The DNA indirectly supervises the manufacture of a different kind of molecule - protein. The haemoglobin is just one example of the enormous range of protein molecules. The coded message of the DNA, written in the four-letter nucleotide alphabet, is translated in a simple mechanical way into another alphabet. This is the alphabet of amino acids which spells out protein molecules. Genes do indirectly control the manufacture of bodies, and the influence is strictly one way: acquired characteristics are not inherited. No matter how much knowledge and wisdom you acquire during your life, not one jot will be passed on to your children by genetic means. Each new generation starts from scratch. A body is the genes’ way of preserving the genes unaltered. Each individual is unique. You cannot get evolution by selecting between entities when there is only one copy of each entity! Chromosomes too are shuffled into oblivion, like hands of cards soon after they are dealt. But the cards themselves survive the shuffling. The cards are the genes. At times, gene language gets a bit tedious, and for brevity and vividness we shall lapse into metaphor. But we shall always keep a sceptical eye on our metaphors, to make sure they can be translated back into gene language if necessary. A gene might be able to assist replicas of itself that are sitting in other bodies. If so, this would appear as individual altruism but it would be brought about by gene selfishness. Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate itself, spreading from brain to brain. Qualities that make for high survival value among memes: longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry. When we die there are two things we can leave behind us: genes and memes.","About evolution and the theory of natural selection, proposing the idea that it's not creatures that are looking to replicate, but individual genes."
Nudge,Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein,014311526X,5,"Libertarian paternalists want to make it easy for people to go their own way; they do not want to burden those who want to exercise their freedom. The paternalistic aspect lies in the claim that it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people's behavior in order to make their lives longer, healthier, and better. In other words, we argue for self-conscious efforts, by institutions in the private sector and also by government, to steer people's choices in directions that will improve their influence choices in a way that will make choosers better off, as judged by themselves. Individuals make pretty bad decisions - decisions they would not have made if they had paid full attention and possessed complete information, unlimited cognitive abilities, and complete self-control. Choices are not blocked, fenced off, or significantly burdened. A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting the fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not. Availability heuristic: They assess the likelihood of risks by asking how readily examples come to mind. If people can easily think of relevant examples, they are far more likely to be frightened and concerned than if they cannot. Biased assessments of risk can perversely influence how we prepare for and respond to crises, business choices, and the political process. Governments are likely to allocate their resources in a way that fits with people's fears rather than in response to the most likely danger. The ""hot-cold empathy gap."" When in a cold state, we do not appreciate how much our desires and our behavior will be altered when we are ""under the influence"" of arousal. Ties were originally used as napkins. Parents should worry less about which college their kids go to and more about which roommate they get. Consistent and unwavering people, in the private or public sector, can move groups and practices in their preferred direction. Collective Conservatism: the tendency of groups to stick to established patterns even as new needs arise. Once a practice (like wearing ties) has become established, it is likely to be perpetuated, even if there is no particular basis for it. Sometimes a tradition can last for a long time, and receive support or at least acquiescence from large numbers of people, even though it was originally the product of a small nudge from a few people or perhaps even one. Of course, a group will shift if it can be shown that the practice is causingserious problems. But if there is uncertainty on that question, people might well continue doing what they have always done. Merely because we think that most other people like it. Many social practices persist for this reason, and a small shock, or nudge, can dislodge them. People are paying less attention to you than you believe. If you have a stain on your shirt, don't worry, they probably won't notice. But in part because people do think that everyone has their eyes fixed on them, they conform to what they think people expect. Those who eat with one other person eat about 35 percent more than they do when they are alone; members of a group of four eat about 75 percent more; those in groups of seven or more eat 96 percent more. When people are asked what they intend to do, they become more likely to act in accordance with their answers. 40,000 people asked a simple question: Do you intend to buy a new car in the next six months? The very question increased purchase rates by 35 percent. People will need nudges for decisions that are difficult and rare, for which they do not get prompt feedback, and when they have trouble translating aspects of the situation into terms that they can easily understand. For all their virtues, markets often give companies a strong incentive to cater to (and profit from) human frailties, rather than to try to eradicate them or to minimize their effects. Self-control issues are most likely to arise when choices and their consequences are separated in time. At one extreme are what might be called investment goods, such as exercise, flossing, and dieting. For these goods the costs are borne immediately, but the benefits are delayed. For investment goods, most people err on the side of doing too little. At the other extreme are what might be called sinful goods: smoking, alcohol, and jumbo chocolate doughnuts are in this category. We get the pleasure now and suffer the consequences later. The benefit of having so little choice is that the chef is authorized to cook you things you would never have thought to order. If consumers have a less than fully rational belief, firms often have more incentive to cater to that belief than to eradicate it.","Introducing the idea of Libertarian Paternalism: influencing people's behavior for their own benefit, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives."
Being Logical: A Guide to Good Thinking,D.Q. McInerny,0812971159,5,"A healthy respect for the firm factualness of the world in which we live, for logic is about reality. Familiarity causes us to make careless judgments about facts right before our eyes. We misread a situation because we are skimming it. Attention demands an active, energetic response to every situation, to the persons, places, and things that make up the situation. It is impossible to be truly attentive and passive at the same time. Don’t just look, see. Don’t just hear, listen. Train yourself to focus on details. The little things are not to be ignored, for it is just the little things that lead us to the big things. If we cannot establish factualness by direct evidence, we must rigorously test the authenticity and reliability of whatever indirect evidence. Our ideas are the means, not the ends, of our knowledge. They link us to the world. If they are clear ideas, the links are strong. The most efficient way to clarify our ideas is to look through them to the objects they represent. Our ideas owe their existence to things outside and independent of the mind, to which they refer: objective facts. Our ideas are clear, and our understanding of them is clear, only to the extent that we keep constant tabs on the things to which they refer. The focus must always be on the originating sources of our ideas in the objective world. The idea of democracy: is it a clear or a sound one? It is, at least potentially. It is a clear or sound idea to the extent that we are able to relate it to the objective world. But there are many things in the objective world that go together to compose the rich meaning of the idea of democracy: persons, events, constitutions, legislative acts, past institutions, present institutions. If my idea of democracy is going to be communicable to others, it must refer to what is common to me and to others, those many things in the objective world that are its originating source. To prevent my idea from being a product of pure subjectivism, in which case it could not be communicated to others, I must continuously touch base with those many facts in the objective world from which the idea was born. No idea, even the most bizarre, can completely sever its ties with the objective world, but ideas can become so remote from that world that their relation to it is difficult to see. Ideas as such are not communicable from one mind to another. They have to be carefully fitted to words, so that the words might communicate them faithfully. It is impossible to have clear communication without clear thinking. How can I give you a clear idea of something if it is not first clear in my own mind? True statements of objective fact are not open to argument; evaluative statements are. If I want an evaluative statement to be accepted, I must argue for it. A word is vague if its referent is blurred. We do not know precisely what the word is pointing to. Consider the two statements “People don’t like music like that” and “They say he will not run for a second term.” The more general the word, the vaguer it is. A sure preventative against vagueness, is to make your words as precise and sharply focused as possible. Before you attempt to persuade an audience that a certain situation is unfair, tell them what you mean by unfairness. The whole purpose of reasoning, of logic, is to arrive at the truth of things. The definition of a statement: a linguistic expression to which the responses “true” or “false” would be appropriate. To affirm a statement is to declare it to be true; to deny it is to brand it as false. A science is any organized body of knowledge that is possessed of first principles. The first principles of any science are those fundamental truths upon which the science is founded and by which all its activities are informed. Reality is not a homogenous mass. It is a composition of individuals, and the individuals are distinguishable from one another. Stated: Between being and nonbeing there is no middle state. Explanation: Something either exists or it does not exist; there is no halfway point between the two. How about becoming? Isn’t the state of becoming between those of being and nonbeing? The answer is no. There is no such thing as just becoming; there are only things that become. The state of becoming is already within the realm of existence. Stated: There is a sufficient reason for everything. What is implied in the principle is that nothing in the physical universe is self-explanatory or the cause of itself. (For a thing to be a cause of itself, it would somehow have to precede itself, which is absurd.) If the primary purpose of logic is to attain the truth, then it is evident that nothing could be more important than avoiding the opposite of truth. Rationalization is reasoning in the service of falsehood. There are times when we hold contradictory views and we know it. What I do, assuming the first statement reflects objective facts, is suppress the second statement. Another way I can allow myself to hold on to statements that contradict the facts is deliberately to refrain from examining the facts to which the statements refer. Some people become so fixated upon life’s gray areas that they eventually succeed in convincing themselves that there is nothing but gray areas. A little realism is in order here. We must recognize that many things are, in fact, clearly and sharply defined, and not to see that is simply not to see clearly. A situation in which you see no clear alternatives does not mean, objectively considered, that there are no clear alternatives. It simply means that you do not see them. Don’t project your subjective state of uncertainty upon the world at large and claim objective status for it. You may, right now, be uncertain about a particular matter, but that experience is only possible because you have known the opposite experience, the experience of being certain about something. A negative can only be recognized as a negative - “uncertainty” - because its positive opposite is already known. There’s an Explanation for Everything, Eventually The principle of sufficient reason tells us that things don’t just happen. They are caused to happen. We do not know the causes of everything, but we know that everything has a cause. To know the causes of things is to have a truly profound understanding of them. To know causes is to be able to control them, and to control causes is to control effects. B is clearly the immediate cause of C, so if C is problematical, that means there is something problematical about B. But because B is itself an effect, whatever is problematical about it is to be traced to its cause A. The problem with C will not be effectively addressed, then, until the ultimate source of the problem with A is taken care of. When we define something, what we are attempting to do is simply identify it more precisely - first by grouping it with other things that are generally similar to it, then by noting what is unique to it (the specific difference) in comparison with the other things in the group. Step 1: “Justice is a social virtue...” Step 2: “...by which each individual renders to all others what is due to them.” Step 1: “Fear is an emotion...” Step 2: “...that causes us to withdraw from perceived danger.” I am not reasoning with you if I simply say that such-and-such is true and expect you to accept it as true only on my say-so. I must show you that such-and-such is true, and I do that by making an argument. An argument will only be as good as the statements of which it is composed, and those statements, in turn, will only be as good as the terms of which they are composed. The most effective arguments are those that are trying to make a single point. Negative statements can be effectively used as corrective responses to false statements. “Not every artist is a neurotic.” The “totally unlike” judgment would be justified by the fact that the two things being compared have no observable features in common. But is that ever the case? Skepticism, as a permanent attitude, is to be avoided. The extreme skeptic proclaims baldly that there is no truth. This is obviously a self-contradictory position, for if there is no truth there is no standard by which that very claim can be assessed, and the skeptic’s statement is empty of meaning. An agnostic is someone who maintains that he lacks enough knowledge regarding a particular issue to be able to make a definite judgment about it. It is one thing to say “I don’t know” after long and assiduous research into a subject. It is quite another to say “I don’t know” when you haven’t even bothered to look into the matter. The person who succumbs to evasive agnosticism uses ignorance as an excuse rather than a reason. Such ignorance is the result of indifference or laziness. A cynic is someone who makes emphatically negative estimates without sufficient evidence. A naïve optimist is someone who makes emphatically positive estimates without sufficient evidence. Both represent illogical positions. An open mind, like an open mouth, should eventually close on something. A healthy open-mindedness does not mean that one is indiscriminately open to everything. To be noncommittal in a situation that demands commitment is no virtue. To be tolerant of everything is to value nothing. Never appeal directly to people’s emotions. Devote your efforts to bringing them to the point where they can see for themselves what is the case. A favorite tactic of fallacious reasoning is to circumvent sound reasoning by appealing directly to the emotions. The Principal Forms of Illogical Thinking A → B. -A therefore -B. If Louise is running, then she is moving. Louise is not running. Therefore, she is not moving. A → B. B therefore A. If Louise is running, then she is moving. Louise is moving. Therefore, she is running. Several Nazis were members of the Kaiser Club. Hans was a member of the Kaiser Club. Therefore, Hans was a Nazi. If it is illogical to single out the longevity of a practice as the sole reason for continuing it, it is just as illogical to cite the practice’s longevity as the sole reason for abandoning it. Modernist thinking assumes that only the new is worthwhile. That a majority of the population in a given society holds a particular opinion on a given matter is interesting sociological information, but it has no necessary bearing on the truth or falsity of the matter in question. Majorities can be wrong. They can also be right. When the argument is ignored and the person responsible for the argument is deliberately attacked, the “ad hominem fallacy” is being committed. (Ad hominem, in Latin, means “against the person.”) It is argument, not just the word of the experts, which should be carrying the authoritative weight. If we are satisfied with only the word of the experts, we are essentially being told: “Don’t ask any questions, just do as we say.” The strongest kind of expert evidence incorporates the reasons the experts advance for holding a certain position. In the strictest sense, no quality can be quantified, since if quality could be perfectly translated into quantity there would be no basis for the distinction between the two in the first place. It is not enough to take things apart; we have to put them back together again. Ed likes to dismantle cars. He has succeeded in taking any number of them apart, but to date he has not managed to put one back together again and get it running. From this we can confidently conclude that Ed doesn’t really know all that much about cars. He can analyze them, but he can’t synthesize them. Getting people to laugh at an argument can serve as a powerful way of dismissing it, but this may have nothing to do with the intrinsic worth of the argument. An Inability to Disprove Does Not Prove: The fact that there is no concrete proof against a position does not constitute an argument in favor of the position. I cannot claim to be right simply because you can’t prove me to be. The fallacy of the false dilemma: In a situation entailing several possibilities, I attempt to persuade you that there are only two.","World getting too fuzzy and unreasonable? Watching too much TV? A good book on logic is a great antidote. I'd never read one before, so I don't know how to compare it to others, but I really loved the clear thinking and deep insights here."
Pragmatic Thinking and Learning,Andy Hunt,1934356050,5,"We tend to look at the teacher/learner relationship the wrong way around: it's not that the teacher teaches; it's that the student learns. The learning is always up to you. Only dead fish go with the flow. In his seminal book The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization, Peter Senge popularized the term systems thinking to describe a different approach of viewing the world. In systems thinking, one tries to envision an object as a connection point of several systems, rather than as a discrete object unto itself. Novices need clear context-free rules by which they can operate. Experts are rendered ineffective if constrained to operate under those same rules. By misunderstanding the Dreyfus model, we can rob them of their expertise. It's actually easy to derail an expert and ruin their performance. All you have to do is force them to follow the rules. No one with expertise in the real world follows the rules to the letter; doing so is demonstrably inefficient. Quite a bit changes as you move from novice to expert. You don't just “know more” or gain skill. Instead, you experience fundamental differences in how you perceive the world, how you approach problem solving, and the mental models you form and use. How you go about acquiring new skills changes. External factors that help your performance - or hinder it - change as well. Charles Darwin: “Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge.” Most people, for most skills, for most of their lives, never get any higher than the second stage, advanced beginner: Performing the tasks they need and learning new tasks as the need arises but never acquiring a more broad-based, conceptual understanding of the task environment. People at lower skill levels tend to overestimate their own abilities - by as much as 50 percent. The only path to a more correct self-assessment is to improve the individual's skill level, which in turn increases metacognitive ability. The hallmark of the expert is their use of intuition and the ability to recognize patterns in context. Deliberate practice, according to noted cognitive scientist Dr. K. Anderson Ericsson, requires four conditions: #1 - You need a well-defined task. #2 - The task needs to be appropriately difficult - challenging but doable. #3 - The environment needs to supply informative feedback that you can act on. #4 - It should also provide opportunities for repetition and correction of errors. Our goal, for most of the rest of this book, is to see how we might better harness intuition and get better at recognizing and applying patterns. On a software team, this idea of providing the right environment for skilled developers is critical. Keep practicing in order to remain expert. You want thinking, responsible developers. Overreliance on formal models will tend to reward herd behavior and devalue individual creativity. By targeting your methodology to novices, you will create a poor working environment for the experienced team members, Any time someone starts a sentence with “All you need to do is...” or “Just do this...,” the odds are they are wrong. For the breaking-and-entering example, “I want to open this locked door” really isn't sufficient. What's the context? Why does the door need to be opened? Is it appropriate to use an axe, a chainsaw, or lock-picking tools, or can we just go around back and use the other door? In systems thinking, as in object-oriented programming, it's often the relationships between things that are interesting, not the things themselves. These relationships help form the context that makes all the difference. Novices need quick successes and context-free rules. You can't expect them to be able to handle novel situations on their own. Given a problem space, they'll stop to consider everything, whether it's relevant or not. Don't confuse them unnecessarily with the big picture. Experts need to have access to the big picture; don't cripple them with restrictive, bureaucratic rules that aim to replace judgment. You want the benefit of their expert judgment. Rate yourself. Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model for the primary skills you use at work? List the ways your current skill level impacts you. Identify other skills where you are a novice, advanced beginner, and so on. Be aware of the possibility of second-order incompetence when making these evaluations. For each of these skills, decide what you need to advance to the next level. Keep these examples in mind as you read the remainder of this book. Think back to problems you've experienced on a project team. Could any of them have been avoided if the team had been aware of the Dreyfus model? What can you do differently going forward? Positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being “happy” broadens your thought processes and brings more of the brain's hardware online. Strive for good design; it really works better. Neuroplasticity (the plastic nature of the brain) also means that the maximum amount you can learn, or the number of skills you attain, is not fixed. There is no upper limit - as long as you believe that. According to Stanford University research psychologist Carol Dweck, author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, students who believed they could not increase their intelligence in fact couldn't. Those who believed in the plasticity of their brains increased their abilities easily. Thinking makes it so. In either case, what you think about the brain's capacities physically affects the “wiring” of the brain itself. That's a pretty profound observation. Just thinking that your brain has more capacity for learning makes it so. Write Drunk, Revise Sober Any software system should be able to be guided by an appropriate metaphor. For instance, a payroll system might be considered analogous to a post office, with discrete mailboxes, delivery schedules, and so on. All metaphors break down eventually, but the idea was that a sufficiently rich metaphor could help guide the design of a system and help answer questions that come up during development. Why do we insert something into a container instead of add it? Programmers are sloppy in their use of metaphors - such as ""tables"". Humor is often based on identifying relationships and distorting them. Building fieldstone walls: you don't plan ahead to gather these particular stones for that wall. You just walk around and pick up a few good-looking stones for the future and make a pile. Then when you get around to building the wall, you look into the stone pile and find a nice match for the section you're working on at the moment. Make a habit of gathering mental fieldstones. Once you have some piled up, the process of building walls becomes easy. It's a good habit to get into. Merlin transforms Arthur into different animals and birds so that he might experience the world in different ways. As a goose looking down on the landscape below, Arthur is struck with the insight that boundaries are artificial constructs: there are no painted lines on the ground showing kingdoms or countries. He begins to realize that all of England could be united under one king. But you don't have to actually transform into a bird as Arthur did; just imagining yourself as a bird (for instance) would have the same effect. From this different vantage point, your brain's search engine will be forced to scrape up different ideas. Only wet babies like change. Do morning pages for at least two weeks. Hone a quick wit. Look for connections or analogies between unrelated things. Read something different from your usual material, for example, fiction, not science fiction, and so on. 4 broad categories of problems: Cognitive biases: How your thinking can be led astray Generational affinity: How your peers influence you Personality tendencies: How your personality influences your thoughts Hardware bugs: How older portions of your brain can override the smarter portions Being aware of these bugs is the first step to mitigating them. Wikipedia lists some ninety common cognitive biases. Hawthorne effect: Researchers have noticed that people have a tendency to change their behaviors when they know they are being studied. Fixing on a decision prematurely reduces your options, perhaps to the point of eliminating the successful choice. You'll learn a little bit more every day. You'll learn more about the users, the project itself, your team, and the technology. That means you'll be at your peak of intelligence at the very end of the project and at your most ignorant at the very beginning. So, do you want to make decisions early on? No; you want to defer closure for as long as possible in order to make a better decision later. But that means critical issues may stay unsettled for a long time, which makes many people acutely uncomfortable. Resist the pressure. Know that you will reach a decision, and the matter will be settled, just not today. Agile software development embraces the idea of working with uncertainty. Early on, you don't know what the project end date will really be. You're not 100 percent certain which features will be present in the next iteration. You don't know how many iterations there will be. And that's perfectly OK: that's the sort of uncertainty you want to be comfortable with. Chinese proverb: the palest ink is better than the best memory. ""Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works. Anything that's invented between when you're 15 and 35 is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it. Anything invented after you're 35 is against the natural order of things."" - Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt The extravert is energized by being with people and socializing. The introvert is not; introverts are territorial and need private mental and environmental space. The introvert draws strength from solitary activities and finds social situations tiring. Seventy-five percent of the population lean to the extravert end of the scale. The other twenty-five percent of us wish they'd leave us alone. Intuitive people are very imaginative and appreciate metaphor, are very innovative, and see many possibilities - life is always around the next corner. Intuitives may skip off to a new activity without completing any. Thinking/Feeling: The T's strict view of the rules may seem cold-blooded to the feeling folks. The thinking folks view the F folks as “bleeding hearts.” Allow for different bugs in different people. Pretend you are the complete opposite type from yourself on each axis. What would the world look like to that kind of person? How would you interact with that person? A recent report in the journal Nature about a very modern problem - road rage. In this study, the leading predictor of a tendency for road rage was the amount of personalization on a vehicle: custom paint job, decals, bumper stickers, and so on. Even more amazing, the content of bumper stickers didn't seem to matter, just the quantity. Five “Save the Whales” stickers could actually prove more dangerous than one “Right to Bear Arms” sticker, for example. Why? We're marking our territory. “Bumper Stickers Reveal Link to Road Rage,” online at http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080613/full/news.2008.889.html. In the old days of letter writing, the time it took to write longhand and the built-in delay before sending (awaiting the postal carrier) both allowed the cooler neocortex to intervene and remind you that perhaps this wasn't such a great idea. But Internet time short-circuits the neocortex and exposes our reptilian responses. It allows you to fully vent your initial visceral reaction. It could be your expert intuition at work, or maybe it's just a cognitive bias or other bug. You need to get some feedback: create a prototype, run some unit tests, and chart some benchmarks. Do what you need to do to prove that your idea is a good one, because your intuition may have been wrong. You need unit tests for yourself, too. To help get a bigger picture perspective and test your understanding and mental model, ask yourself something like the following questions: How do you know? Says who? How specifically? How does what I'm doing cause you to...? Compared to what or whom? Does it always happen? Can you think of an exception? What would happen if you did (or didn't)? What stops you from...? Is there anything you can actually measure? Get hard numbers on? Any statistics? These questions from the research on NLP meta models. See Tools of Critical Thinking: Metathoughts for Psychology. If you think you've defined something, try to also define its opposite. Mastering knowledge alone, without experience, isn't effective. ""You got to be careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there."" - Yogi Berra SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-boxed. For any goal you have in mind (losing weight, deposing your boss, conquering the world, and so on), you need to have a plan: a series of objectives that will help get to your goal. Each objective should have the SMART characteristics. Measurable goes hand-in-hand with being specific. It's hard to measure something general and abstract but much easier to measure something concrete and specific - using actual numbers. If you think you can't measure your objective, then it's probably not specific enough. “To make time for” is a bit of a misnomer; time can't be created or destroyed. Time can only be allocated. Part of diversification is considering the risk vs. return ratio. Any area you decide to invest in may be high or low risk and high or low return on investment. For instance, learning a popular technology such as .NET is fairly low risk - many legions of programmers are doing it, so there is plenty of support, published books, courses, job openings, and so on. But that also means it's fairly low return on investment - there are many legions of programmers doing it, so there's a lot of competition for those job openings. The fact that you do it isn't so special. Today, any number of technologies on the horizon are high risk and potentially high reward. They may go nowhere - that's the risk. Erlang or Haskell may be the next major language breakthrough. Or not. One major difference between knowledge investments and financial investments is that all knowledge investments have some value. This technique of studying a book or other printed matter is known as SQ3R; that's an acronym for the steps you need to take. Survey: Scan the table of contents and chapter summaries for an overview. Question: Note any questions you have. Read: Read in its entirety. Recite: Summarize, take notes, and put in your own words. Review: Reread, expand notes, and discuss with colleagues. Test-driven learning. When testing yourself, you can take advantage of the spacing effect. Low-level detailed design documents become obsolete almost immediately. Prepared Mind: Neural Activity Prior to Problem Presentation Predicts Subsequent Solution by Sudden Insight Mental preparation that involves an inward focus of attention can promote flashes of insight, even if the preparation occurs well in advance of facing any particular problem. Turning your attention inward, as you would do when working with a mind map, sets up some condition in the brain that allows for happy flashes of insight later in the project. So, it might be that documenting is more important than documentation. Try to explain your material to a child or someone outside your field of expertise. The trick is to do so in terms they can understand. That's the real benefit to teaching in general; it clarifies your own understanding and reveals many of your underlying assumptions. Take a new topic, and try to teach it. ""We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits on a hot stove-lid; he will never sit on a hot stove-lid again - and that is well; but also he will never sit on a cold one anymore."" - Mark Twain Imagine you were taking a dance class, only to find you had to pass a test on “dance facts” before actually dancing. We're not really designed to just receive information but rather to explore and build mental models on our own. We need to be able to poke at a problem, to explore it, or to “get used to it” To solve a problem, ask yourself these questions: What are the unknown aspects? What do you know? What data do you have? What constraints and what rules apply? Then make a plan, execute it, and review the results. Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or similar unknowns. Draw a picture. Solve a related or simpler problem; drop some constraints or use a subset of the data. Were all the data and constraints used? If not, why not? Try restating the problem. Try working backward from the unknown toward the data. Fully embrace a new skill. You need to unlearn just as much as you need to learn. Examples include moving from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from the typewriter to the computer, from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, and from single programs on the desktop to cloud computing. For each of these transitions, the new way was fundamentally different from the old way. And where they were different, you had to let go of the old way. A functional programming language, such as Erlang or Haskell, much of what you've previously learned about programming languages will just get in the way. They aren't similar to traditional procedural languages in any way that's helpful. We tend to think of failure or ignorance in a very negative light, as something to be avoided at all costs. But it's not important to get it right the first time; it's important to get it right the last time. We learn best by discovery, not instruction. Permission to fail leads to success. Pat Metheny: “Always be the worst guy in every band you're in. If you're the best guy there, you need to be in a different band. And I think that works for almost everything that's out there as well.” Pretend you are the expert. Experience using scaffolding. Swimmers do this by being attached to a rope and pulled through the water at high speed. Before a swimmer can achieve that sort of speed on their own, they get to experience what it will feel like. The overabundance of information has resulted in a poverty of knowledge and attention. Information is raw data in a given context. For instance, the fact that Microsoft bought some company for a billion dollars is just information, and there's no shortage of information these days. Knowledge imparts meaning to that information. You apply your time, attention, and skill to information to produce knowledge. Looking at that particular Microsoft acquisition and knowing how it might change the market, provide new opportunities, and destroy others constitutes knowledge. Try to build up to a set period of twenty minutes or so every day, preferably at the same time. Are you “cooking” when you're letting something marinate for twelve hours? Are you “working” when you're sitting around thinking about a problem? Yes. If the task is something you really just don't want to do, then it's likely that any diversions are simply procrastination. If you're still interested in it but feel “stuck,” then the ideas are still stewing, and it's OK. If you can't think of three ways a plan can go wrong or think of three different solutions to a problem, then you haven't thought it through enough.

The Great Formula,Mark Joyner,0471778230,5,"The Great Formula Step 1: Create The Irresistible Offer Step 2: Present it to a Thirsty Crowd Step 3: Sell them a Second Glass Only three ways to increase the revenue of any business endeavor: 1. Get your message in front of more eyeballs 2. Get more money per eyeball 3. Sell more products to your existing customers on the back end Why is it that most business owners spend about 95 percent of their time on things that don't fall into those three categories? Outside of the logistical and administrative portion of your business, The Great Formula represents every single meaningful thing you can do in your business. Further, your logistical and administrative functions should all be subordinate to your work with The Great Formula. Irresistible Offer is an identity-building offer central to a product, service, or company where the believable return on investment is communicated so clearly and efficiently that it's immediately apparent you'd have to be a fool to pass it up. None of the great fortunes of the world have been built on the first glass. They were all built by selling a Second Glass of something. Four Strategies for Capturing Thirsty Crowds 1. Pay for access to a crowd 2. Speculate for access to a crowd 3. Manifest a crowd from thin air 4. Find lost crowds. Four Second-Glass Delivery Methods 1. The upsell 2. The cross-sell 3. The follow-up 4. The continuity Edmonds offered the Edmonds Cookery Book, a natural Second Glass. But it didn't stop there. Over time, the company introduced new cooking products, and the trusted recipes in the faithful cookbook were updated to incorporate all the latest Edmonds offerings, spurring further sales of both the cookbook and the products. We would surely be oversold and that we would use a ""random selection process"" to select the future owners of the tiles. In short, we would. let our computer randomly generate who our customers would be. The ones who were not selected we would advise that the series wouldn't be available to them. The ad ran and it was a huge success. Not only did we sell all 1,250 tile sets, but we received a total of 8,000 requests, most of which we had to turn down. Presto! Overnight, we had a large, hot mailing list. Deny somebody something, create a mailing list of rejected customers, offer them something in the future, and sit back and count the profits. ""If you and I both owned a hamburger stand and we were in a contest to see who would sell the most hamburgers, what advantages would you most like to have on your side?"" ""The only advantage I want,"" I reply, ""is a starving crowd!"" Constantly be on the lookout for groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving Your ads should look like an exciting piece of editorial material. Whenever you write an ad it should look, insofar as possible, exactly like a rave review written by a reporter. It should have the look of an exciting news flash. Several effective ways to discover what a crowd is thirsty for: Take careful note of what they're buying now. Listen to their complaints about what they're buying now. Standard order form vs. order form upsell: I discovered an astonishing 40 percent of people were ticking that box and taking the Second Glass offer To make something 2nd-glass ready, add ""Volume I"" to the name. That's it. I know it seems almost too simple, but if people like your Volume I, guess what they'll want? Repeat their words back accurately and you create magic. So to use this in your presentation you would frame your presentation around the values they have given you. We tend to trust people we think are just like us, who have the same ideas, values, and opinions toward things. Find a big enough group of people who are what I call ""oholic"" about a subject. That is, they are passionate, irrational, and almost insatiable about their addiction toward the particular subject. There is a way to simulate that conversation with them: have it with yourself first. Think about what the prospect would be thinking, the questions they would ask, the objections they would have if they were there with you in person. Get that conversation down on paper. Say things in a subtle fashion that makes them prove it to you. For example, one of the techniques is ""I can't promise you anything."" You never want to talk down to your customers and/or prospects when you're trying to illustrate a point. Doing so will kill the bonding and relationship-building process Tell them a story and use yourself as the idiot. Or tell them a story where someone else is the idiot. But don't ever make them the idiot ""If I tell them, they doubt me. If they tell me, it's a fact."" Use third party stories, me-too stories, to meet them where they are by asking the right questions, you can create an atmosphere where you bring it out of them. Then the statement comes from them. Make them feel like they're the most important person in the world is by painting a picture and putting them in the picture. Make them experience what it's going to be like. When I get e-mails from people I often will reprint their question and praise them for such a good question. (Publicly replying to emails:) It makes me more human in their eyes because they see I really do interact with everyone, listen to them, and give them what they want. It also makes them want the same kind of recognition that John just got from me in front of thousands of people. Let them in on a secret that you wouldn't tell just anyone. What are some secrets you possess? You've got a bunch of them if you think about it. Maybe it's a way of getting superior service. Most people try to take their personality out of their business communications. If you are getting a certain type of client/customer that you don't advertise to directly, focus all of your energy on getting more of those types of customers if they are profitable. Masseuse: ""If you have an empty room in your workplace at least one day per week, I will offer all of your customers a free session with me. If they come back for more, I will give you 33 percent of whatever I make. This is extra income that costs you nothing to make-and all you have to do is let your customers know that you will set up a free session for them with me if they would like to check it out."" Guess who said yes? Everyone who had a free room! I offered the first session for free. And at end of the session I would tell them that they would get the best long-term results if they came in for 5 to 10 sessions. I was using other people's existing facilities and customer base-that meant no rent or advertising costs). Step 1 is usually to go and confirm your subscription to the newsletter (this keeps your ear open to further communications-and sales opportunities-in the future) Step 2 is to listen to the recording of a teleseminar (or to call in to a live teleseminar) Step 3 is to ""Do Your Homework."" This is another call to action. It is asking you to go and do something else that will give you what you are looking for. It may be to sign up for something else, or it could be a link that brings you to a sales page where you buy something. This third step, the ""Do Your Homework"" step, is the Second Glass. Want to see an awesome example of how this works? Go to www.asktellman.com Now, how can you apply this if you are a dentist or a mechanic? It's simple. What if, when people call to make an appointment, you book their appointment and tell them to look in the mail tomorrow, because you are going to overnight them a special report about ""The 7 Steps to a Sexy Smile and Saving Money on Your Next Trip to the Dentist"" or ""9 Ways to Double the Value of Your Vehicle and Save Thousands with Your Mechanic."" Well, I'll bet that they will read that special report before they come in to see you - and at the end of that report you tell them how they can get a subscription to your monthly ""Sexy Smile and Dental Savings"" report - and if they call your office to order in the next 24 hours you will give them half off the price of their subscription. Bam! You just made a recurring sale before the person even comes in for their appointment. Plus it gives you a way of staying in constant contact with your paying customers. ""Order form"" is another term for ""time to explode your profits."" Your prospects have decided to part with their hard-earned cash, so why not try to get them to order another item hassle free? Imagine you're a man trying to chat up a woman in a bar and she replies, ""Did your mommy know you'd be out past your bedtime when she dressed you tonight?"" If the woman was really not interested in you, she wouldn't be testing you. They theorize that these are tests of your social value, and how well you respond will determine your worthiness as a suitor.",Create an irresistible offer. Present it to people who need it. Sell them more afterwards. Lots of examples of this.
Outliers: The Story of Success,Malcolm Gladwell,0316017922,5,"The striking thing about Ericsson’s study is that he and his colleagues couldn’t find any “naturals,” musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time their peers did. Nor could they find any “grinds,” people who worked harder than everyone else, yet just didn’t have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggestes that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder. What’s ten years? Well, it’s roughly how long it takes to put in ten thousand hours of hard practice. Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness. By the time they had their first burst of success in 1964, The Beatles had performed live an estimated twelve hundred times. In one seven-month period in 1971, Bill Gates and his cohorts ran up 1,575 hours of computer time on the ISI mainframe, which averages out to eight hours a day, seven days a week. “It was my obsession,” Gates says. In the 1860s and 1870s, the American economy went through perhaps the greatest transformation in its history. This was when the railroads were being built and when Wall Street emerged. It was when industrial manufacturing started in earnest. It was when all the rules by which the traditional economy had functioned were broken and remade. What this list says is that it really matters how old you were when that transformation happened. A basketball player only has to be tall enough - and the same is true of intelligence. Past a certain point, height stops mattering so much. Write down as many different uses that you can think of for the following objects: 1. a brick 2. a blanket This is an example of what’s called a “divergence test” (as opposed to a test like the Raven’s, which asks you to sort through a list of possibilities and converge on the right answer). It requires you to use your imagination and take your mind in as many different directions as possible. With a divergence test, obviously there isn’t a single right answer. What the test giver is looking for are the number and the uniqueness of your responses. He possessed the kind of savvy that allowed him to get what he wanted from the world. Robert Sternberg calls this “practical intelligence.” To Sternberg, practical intelligence includes things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.” It’s practical in nature: that is, it’s not knowledge for its own sake. It’s knowledge that helps you read situations correctly and get what you want. “They acted as though they had a right to pursue their own individual preferences and to actively manage interactions in institutional settings. They appeared comfortable in those settings; they were open to sharing information and asking for attention....It was common practice among middle-class children to shift interactions to suit their preferences.” They lacked something that could have been given to them if we’d only known they needed it: a community around them that prepared them properly for the world. No one - not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses - ever makes it alone. They had a skill that they had been working on for years that was suddenly very valuable. The sense of possibility so necessary for success comes not just from inside us or from our parents. It comes from our time: from the particular opportunities that our particular place in history presents us with. Borgenicht took out a small notebook. Everywhere he went, he wrote down what people were wearing and what was for sale - menswear, women’s wear, children’s wear. He wanted to find a “novel” item, something that people would wear that was not being sold in the stores. For four more days he walked the streets. On the evening of the final day as he walked toward home, he saw a half dozen girls playing hopscotch. One of the girls was wearing a tiny embroidered apron over her dress, cut low in the front with a tie in the back, and it struck him, suddenly, that in his previous days of relentlessly inventorying the clothing shops of the Lower East Side, he had never seen one of those aprons for sale. By 1900, control of the garment industry had passed almost entirely into the hands of the Eastern European newcomers. As Borgenicht puts it, the Jews “bit deep into the welcoming land and worked like madmen at what they knew.” To come to New York City in the 1890s with a background in dressmaking or sewing or Schnittwaren Handlung was a stroke of extraordinary good fortune. It was like showing up in Silicon Valley in 1986 with ten thousand hours of computer programming already under your belt. What Borgenicht was getting in his eighteen-hour days was a lesson in the modern economy. He was learning market research. He was learning manufacturing. He was learning how to negotiate with imperious Yankees. He was learning how to plug himself into popular culture in order to understand new fashion trends.The Irish and Italian immigrants who came to New York in the same period didn’t have that advantage. They didn’t have a skill specific to the urban economy. Three things - autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward - are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. It is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine and five. It’s whether our work fulfills us. Work that fulfills those three criteria is meaningful. Being a teacher is meaningful. Being a physician is meaningful. So is being an entrepreneur. The Beatles didn’t recoil in horror when they were told they had to play eight hours a night, seven days a week. They jumped at the chance. Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Jewish doctors and lawyers did not become professionals in spite of their humble origins. They became professionals because of their humble origins. Success is not a random act. It arises out of a predictable and powerful set of circumstances and opportunities, It shouldn’t be hard to figure out where the perfect lawyer comes from. This person will have been born in a demographic trough, so as to have had the best of New York’s public schools and the easiest time in the job market. He will be Jewish, of course, and so, locked out of the old-line downtown law firms on account of his “antecedents.” This person’s parents will have done meaningful work in the garment business, passing on to their children autonomy and complexity and the connection between effort and reward. A good school - although it doesn’t have to be a great school - will have been attended. He need not have been the smartest in the class, only smart enough. That region was plagued by a particularly virulent strain of what sociologists call a “culture of honor.” Cultures of honor tend to take root in highlands and other marginally fertile areas, such as Sicily or the mountainous Basque regions of Spain. A herdsman has to worry. He’s under constant threat of ruin through the loss of his animals. So he has to be aggressive: he has to make it clear, through his words and deeds, that he is not weak. He has to be willing to fight in response to even the slightest challenge to his reputation - and that’s what a “culture of honor” means. It’s a world where a man’s reputation is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth. Test insult: Young men from the northern part of the United States treated the incident with amusement. They laughed it off. But the southerners? Oh, my. They were angry. Cultural legacies are powerful forces. They have deep roots and long lives. They persist, generation after generation, virtually intact, even as the economic and social and demographic conditions that spawned them have vanished, and they play such a role in directing attitudes and behavior that we cannot make sense of our world without them. Planes are safer when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it means the second pilot isn’t going to be afraid to speak up. Combating mitigation. It is the success of this war on mitigation as much as anything else that accounts for the extraordinary decline in airline accidents in recent years. Hofstede argued, for example, that cultures can be usefully distinguished according to how much they expect individuals to look after themselves. He called that measurement the “individualism-collectivism scale.” The country that scores highest on the individualism end of that scale is the United States. Not surprisingly, the United States is also the only industrialized country in the world that does not provide its citizens with universal health care. At the opposite end of the scale is Guatemala. Another of Hofstede’s dimensions is “uncertainty avoidance.” How well does a culture tolerate ambiguity? Here are the top five “uncertainty avoidance” countries, according to Hofstede’s database - that is, the countries most reliant on rules and plans and most likely to stick to procedure regardless of circumstances: 1. Greece 2. Portugal 3. Guatemala 4. Uruguay 5. Belgium The bottom five - that is, the cultures best able to tolerate ambiguity - are: 49. Hong Kong 50. Sweden 51. Denmark 52. Jamaica 53. Singapore People who grow rice have always worked harder than almost any other kind of farmer. China and Japan never developed that kind of oppressive feudal system, because feudalism simply can’t work in a rice economy. Growing rice is too complicated and intricate for a system that requires farmers to be coerced and bullied into going out into the fields each morning. We could predict precisely the order in which every country would finish in the Math Olympics without asking a single math question. All we would have to do is give them some task measuring how hard they were willing to work. In fact, we wouldn’t even have to give them a task. We should be able to predict which countries are best at math simply by looking at which national cultures place the highest emphasis on effort and hard work.So, which places are at the top of both lists? The answer shouldn’t surprise you: Singapore, South Korea, China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, and Japan. What those five have in common, of course, is that they are all cultures shaped by the tradition of wet-rice agriculture and meaningful work.* They are the kinds of places where, for hundreds of years, penniless peasants, slaving away in the rice paddies three thousand hours a year, said things to one another like “No one who can rise before dawn three hundred sixty days a year fails to make his family rich.” David Levin, who founded KIPP with a fellow teacher, Michael Feinberg, in 1994. We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteen-year-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur. But that’s the wrong lesson. Our world only allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a time-sharing terminal in 1968. If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today? To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success - the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history - with a society that provides opportunities for all. If Canada had a second hockey league for those children born in the last half of the year, it would today have twice as many adult hockey stars. Now multiply that sudden flowering of talent by every field and profession. The world could be so much richer than the world we have settled for.","Deep study of why some people are so much more successful. Often due to circumstances and early opportunities, but really comes down to the fact that it takes about 10,000 hours of hard work to master something."
Lucky Or Smart?,Bo Peabody,1439210101,5,"I was smart enough to realize I was getting lucky. The number-one killer of start-ups is when entrepreneurs confuse “being lucky” with “being smart.” You must possess the humility to distinguish one from the other. There is a pseudo-scientific formula for creating business luck. And the key element is this: Lucky things happen to entrepreneurs who start fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive companies. Why? Because lots of smart people will gather around companies with these qualities. As it turns out, precious few of them exist. And the vast majority of human beings, and certainly most of the smart ones, are constitutionally caring creatures who would, if given the chance, prefer to spend their valuable time in a positive setting contributing to the betterment of society rather than in a negative setting contributing to its detriment. Shocking, I know, but true. And when smart, inspired people gather around a fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive company, they work very hard. And when smart, inspired people work very hard, serendipity ensues. Serendipity—the faculty of making fortuitous discoveries by chance—causes lots of unexpected things to happen to a company. Some of these unexpected things are good. Some are bad. But because no one planned for the good things to happen, they appear as luck. In other words, the best way to ensure that lucky things happen is to make sure that a lot of things happen. It’s really that simple. In applying this formula, the entrepreneur has two tasks: 1. Create an environment wheresmart people will gather 2. Be smart enough to stay out of the way and let luck happen. Much of what makes a company fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive is not what the company’s business model actually is, but how the entrepreneur communicates the mission of the company. Create an “aura of authenticity,” which is the elixir that attracts smart people and inspires them. My formula for getting lucky in business is reasonably simple: Start a company that is fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive. Create an aura of authenticity around your start-up by carefully crafting your mission and communicating it with charisma and passion. Your company will quickly attract smart, inspired people who will work very hard. Treat all these people fairly. Provide them with a clear action plan and give them the latitude to exercise their creativity. The ability to focus and be patient is typically associated not with entrepreneurs but with managers. Entrepreneurs want results immediately, while managers are happy to wait. (About the techies who said they could do what he does:) The bet was that I could configure a web server before any of them could raise $1 million. Start-ups are like extreme-skiing runs. The person who wins is the one who screws up the least and doesn’t die. There is no such thing as a great start-up, because every startup can be improved upon. And most of the improvement happens between the first incarnation of a company and the tenth. Maybe by then, the company might well be considered great. And that is precisely the moment by which all of the true entrepreneurs will have left the building. Project Mercury and Tripod are good. NASA and General Electric are great. Start-ups are no place for greatness; leave that to the large, established companies. If your idea is big enough, and crazy enough, all you have to do is survive. If you survive, you will succeed. Odd people and ordinary people get a co-dependent kick out of being needed and liked by each other. If you’re going to be an entrepreneur, be prepared to work with people who not only don’t follow the rutted path of the masses but openly shun it. After all, that’s why these people are willing to listen to you and your fundamentally innovative ideas in the first place. In working with odd people, you are in for some serious challenges. But you’re also in for some serious treats. These are the smartest, most interesting people on the planet, and the fact that they are willing to give your ordinary B-getting ass the time of day should flatter you. Bo Peabody to college that rejected him: “I reject your rejection.” Most people would simply accept the rejection. Don’t. Ever. Train yourself not to shut down when you hear the word “no.” That is in fact just the time to really start fighting. No human being likes to say “no” to another human being. When he does, he is at his weakest moment. Take that opportunity, and start selling. It never pays to get indignant in any way. In every meeting, in every situation, you must always, always, always be gracious. The business world is a small place; what goes around comes around. Your ability to remain gracious will be tested often, and you will constantly be tempted to become defensive. 90 percent of Tripod’s value was in the amount of press we received in such a concentrated period of time. The quickest way to completely tank your company is to wholeheartedly believe what you read in the press, especially if it happens to be about you. The vast majority of the press is not interested in covering what is actually happening. They are interested in covering what they think people want to think is actually happening. The best use you can make of a Blackberry is to buy them for all of your competitors. They’ll never have time for another creative thought. If you’re doing something fundamentally innovative, then there shouldn’t be much in the news for you anyway. By definition, the news has already happened. And the more you fill your head with the past, the less room there is to think about the future. Recognize when there is in fact a right answer to a difficult question and you have no idea what it is.",Tiny book by an incredibly successful serial entrepreneur telling his tales and lessons learned.
The China Study,Campbell and Campbell,1932100660,5,"What is my prescription for good health? In short, it is about the multiple health benefits of consuming plant-based foods, and the largely unappreciated health dangers of consuming animal-based foods, including all types of meat, dairy and eggs. Hippocrates said, “There are, in effect, two things: to know and to believe one knows. To know is science. To believe one knows is ignorance.” In experimental animals cancer growth can be turned on and off by nutrition, despite very strong genetic predisposition. The concept of quality really means the efficiency with which food proteins are used to promote growth. This would be well and good if the greatest efficiency equaled the greatest health, but it doesn’t, and that’s why the terms efficiency and quality are misleading. “Low-quality” plant protein, which allows for slow but steady synthesis of new proteins, is the healthiest type of protein. Slow but steady wins the race. The human body can derive all the essential amino acids from the natural variety of plant proteins that we encounter every day. It doesn’t require eating higher quantities of plant protein or meticulously planning every meal. The best peanuts, which filled “cocktail” jars, were hand selected from a moving conveyor belt, leaving the worst, moldiest nuts to be delivered to the end of the belt to make peanut butter. Initiates cancer-prone cells: Chemicals that do this are called carcinogens. These chemicals are most often the byproducts of industrial processes, although small amounts may be formed in nature, as is the case with aflatoxin. These carcinogens genetically transform, or mutate, normal cells into cancer-prone cells. A mutation involves permanent alteration of the genes of the cell, with damage to its DNA. Promotion is reversible, depending on whether the early cancer growth is given the right conditions in which to grow. This is where certain dietary factors become so important. Low protein intake could markedly decrease enzyme activity and prevent dangerous carcinogen binding to DNA. The body could “remember” early carcinogen insults even though they might then lie dormant with low protein intake. That is, exposure to aflatoxin left a genetic “imprint” that remained dormant with 5% dietary protein until nine weeks later when this imprint reawakened to form foci with 20% dietary protein. In simple terms, the body holds a grudge. It suggests that if we are exposed in the past to a carcinogen that initiates a bit of cancer that remains dormant, this cancer can still be “reawakened” by bad nutrition. Foci developed only when the animals met or exceeded the amount of dietary protein (12%) needed to satisfy their body growth rate. When the animals met and surpassed their requirement for protein, disease onset began. Ten percent dietary protein is equivalent to eating about 50-60 grams of protein per day, depending on body weight and total calorie intake. The national average of 15-16% is about 70-100 grams of protein per day, with men at the upper part of the range and women at the lower end. In food terms, there are about twelve grams of protein in 100 calories of spinach (fifteen ounces) and five grams of protein in 100 calories of raw chick peas (just over two tablespoons). There are about thirteen grams of protein in 100 calories of porterhouse steak (just over one and a half ounces). A low-protein diet could override the cancer-causing effect of a very powerful carcinogen. Plant protein did not promote cancer growth, even at the higher levels of intake. Cow’s milk protein is an exceptionally potent cancer promoter. Nutrients from animal-based foods increased tumor development while nutrients from plant-based foods decreased tumor development. One of the strongest predictors of Western diseases was blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol is made in the liver. Blood cholesterol and dietary cholesterol, although chemically identical, do not represent the same thing. Animal-based foods were correlated with increasing blood cholesterol. With almost no exceptions, nutrients from plant-based foods were associated with decreasing levels of blood cholesterol. People who migrated from one area to another and who started eating the typical diet of their new residency assumed the disease risk of the area to which they moved. First menstrual period: the range of village averages was fifteen to nineteen years, with an average of seventeen years. The U.S. average is roughly eleven years old! Even though fiber was not digested, it was vital for good health. Fiber was able to pull water from the body into the intestines to keep things moving along. These undigested fibers, like stick-um paper, also gather up nasty chemicals that find their way into our intestines and that might be carcinogenic. If we don’t consume enough fiber, we are susceptible to constipation-based diseases. Dietary fiber is exclusively found in plant-based foods. Fiber, having few or no calories itself, helps dilute the caloric density of our diets, creates a sense of fullness and helps to shut down appetite, among other things. In doing so, it satisfies our hunger and minimizes the overconsumption of calories. There was no evidence showing that increasing fiber intake impaired iron absorption in the body. In fact, we found the opposite effect. A good indicator of how much iron is in the blood, hemoglobin, actually increased with greater intakes of dietary fiber. High-fiber consumption reflected high plant-based food consumption; foods such as beans, leafy vegetables and whole grains are all high in fiber. The colors of fruits and vegetables are derived from a variety of chemicals called antioxidants. We do not naturally build shields to protect ourselves against free radicals. As we are not plants, we do not carry out photosynthesis and therefore do not produce any of our own antioxidants. Fortunately the antioxidants in plants work in our bodies the same way they work in plants. It is a wonderful harmony. Vitamin C intake from fruits clearly showed a powerful protective effect against a variety of diseases. Can we say that vitamin C, beta-carotene and dietary fiber are solely responsible for preventing these cancers? In other words, can a pill containing vitamin C and beta-carotene or a fiber supplement create these health effects? No. The triumph of health lies not in the individual nutrients, but in the whole foods that contain those nutrients: plant-based foods. In a bowl of spinach salad, for example, we have fiber, antioxidants and countless other nutrients that are orchestrating a wondrous symphony of health as they work in concert within our bodies. The message could not be simpler: eat as many whole fruits, vegetables and whole grains as you can, and you will probably derive all of the benefits noted above as well as many others. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains are the healthiest foods you can consume, and they are primarily made of carbohydrates. The healthiest diet you can possibly consume is a high-carbohydrate diet. It has been shown to reverse heart disease, reverse diabetes, prevent a plethora of chronic diseases, and yes, it has been shown many times to cause significant weight loss. The health benefits of a high-carbohydrate diet come from eating the complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Eat an apple, a zucchini or a plate of brown rice topped with beans and other vegetables. Only a small amount of calories needs to be retained by our body to cause significant change in body weight. For example, if we retain only an extra fifty calories per day, this can lead to an extra ten pounds per year. You may not think that this is a lot, but over a period of five years, that’s an extra fifty pounds. When we treat our body well by eating the right foods, it knows how to partition the calories away from body fat and into the more desirable functions like keeping the body warm, running the body metabolism, supporting and encouraging physical activity or just disposing of any excess. The body is using multiple intricate mechanisms to decide how calories get used, stored or “burned off.” Consuming diets high in protein and fat transfers calories away from their conversion into body heat to their storage form—as body fat Diets low in protein and fat cause calories to be “lost” as body heat. Consuming more protein was associated with greater body size. However, this effect was primarily attributed to plant protein, Individuals can achieve their genetic potential for growth and body size by consuming a plant-based diet. The most important point of this book: Everything in food works together to create health or disease. The attention paid to fat and cholesterol is misguided. Fat and cholesterol were merely indicators of animal food intake. The more animal protein you eat, the more heart disease you have. The diet Dr. Esselstyn and his wife Ann, followed was free of all added fat and almost all animal products. “Avoid oils, meat, fish, fowl and dairy products.” Forty-nine coronary events prior to a whole foods, plant-based diet, and zero events for those patients who adhered to a whole foods, plant-based diet. Dr. Esselstyn has done what “Big Science” has been trying to do, without success, for over fifty-five years: he defeated heart disease. They could eat as much food as they wanted, as long as it was on the acceptable food list, which included fruits, vegetables and grains. “No animal products were allowed except egg white and one cup per day of non-fat milk or yogurt.” Losing body weight on a plant-based diet is much less likely to occur if the diet includes too many refined carbohydrates. Sweets, pastries and pastas won’t do it. These foods are high in readily digested sugars and starches and, for the pastries, oftentimes very high in fat as well. I usually refer to the optimal diet as a whole foods, plant-based diet. Notice that a strict vegetarian diet is not necessarily the same thing as a whole foods, plant-based diet. Some people become vegetarian only to replace meat with dairy foods, added oils and refined carbohydrates, including pasta made with refined grains, sweets and pastries. I refer to these people as “junk-food vegetarians” because they are not consuming a nutritious diet. How can you apply it to your own life? First of all, throw away ideas about counting calories. Generally speaking, you can eat as much as you want and still lose weight—as long you eat the right type of food. Feeling hungry is a sign that something is wrong, and prolonged hunger causes your body to slow the overall rate of metabolism in defense. Short-term studies in which subjects consume fewer calories while eating a plant-based diet. Over the long term, these subjects will find it very difficult to continue consuming an abnormally low level of calories; weight loss due to calorie restriction rarely leads to long-term weight loss. Exercising a mere fifteen to forty-five minutes per day, every day, will maintain a body weight that is eleven to eighteen pounds lighter than it would otherwise be. We housed rats fed either 5% or 20% casein diets in cages equipped with exercise wheels outfitted with meters to record the number of turns of the wheel. Within the very first day, the 5% casein-fed animals voluntarily “exercised” in the wheel about twice as much as the 20% casein-fed animals. The diet that helps to reduce weight in the short run needs to be the same diet that creates and maintains health in the long run. The prostate is a male reproductive organ about the size of a walnut, located between the bladder and the colon. It is responsible for producing some of the fluid that helps sperm on its quest to fertilize the female’s egg. One of the most consistent, specific links between diet and prostate cancer has been dairy consumption. Dairy intake is “one of the most consistent dietary predictors for prostate cancer in the published literature,” and those who consume the most dairy have double to quadruple the risk. Major contributors of animal protein, meats, dairy products and eggs have frequently been associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer Vitamin D metabolism. This “vitamin” is not a nutrient that we need to consume. Our body can make all that we need simply by being in sunlight fifteen to thirty minutes every couple of days. The main component of this process is an active form of vitamin D produced in the body from the vitamin D that we get from food or sunshine. This active or “supercharged” D produces many benefits throughout the body, including the prevention of cancer, autoimmune diseases and diseases like osteoporosis. This all-important supercharged D is not something that you get from food or from a drug. As it turns out, our diet can determine how much of this supercharged D is produced and how it works once it is produced. Animal protein that we consume has the tendency to block the production of supercharged D, leaving the body with low levels of this vitamin D in the blood. If these low levels persist, prostate cancer can result. Animal protein suppresses the production of “supercharged” D. Excessive calcium, as found in milk, also suppresses the production of “supercharged” D. Memory loss, disorientation and confusion are not inevitable parts of aging, but problems linked to that all-important lifestyle factor: diet. High vitamin E levels in the blood are related to less memory loss. Less memory loss also is associated with higher levels of vitamin C and selenium, both of which reduce free radical activity. Vitamins E and C are antioxidants found almost exclusively in plant foods, while selenium is found in both animal- and plant-based foods. For every three additional servings of fruits and vegetables a day, the risk of stroke will be reduced by 22%. Americans love to hear good things about their bad habits. PRINCIPLE #1 Nutrition represents the combined activities of countless food substances. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Our bodies have evolved with this infinitely complex network of reactions in order to derive maximal benefit from whole foods, as they appear in nature. The misguided may trumpet the virtues of one specific nutrient or chemical, but this thinking is too simplistic. Our bodies have learned how to benefit from the chemicals in food as they are packaged together, discarding some and using others as they see fit. I cannot stress this enough, as it is the foundation of understanding what good nutrition means. PRINCIPLE #2 Vitamin supplements are not a panacea for good health. PRINCIPLE #3 There are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants. It is recommended that we consume B12 in food. Research has convincingly shown that plants grown in healthy soil that has a good concentration of vitamin B12 will readily absorb this nutrient. 10 However, plants grown in “lifeless” soil (non-organic soil) may be deficient in vitamin B12. It is estimated that we hold a three-year store of vitamin B12 in our bodies. I call these supplements “separation from nature pills,” because a healthy diet of fresh, organic plant-based foods grown in rich soil and a lifestyle that regularly takes you outdoors is the best answer to these issues. PRINCIPLE #4 Genes do not determine disease on their own. Genes function only by being activated, or expressed, and nutrition plays a critical role in determining which genes, good and bad, are expressed. The origin of every single disease is genetic. Our genes are the code to everything in our bodies, good and bad. Without genes, there would be no cancer. Without genes, there would be no obesity, diabetes or heart disease. And without genes, there would be no life. PRINCIPLE #5 Nutrition can substantially control the adverse effects of noxious chemicals. A chemical touted as being highly carcinogenic, could be entirely controlled by nutrition. Even with large doses of aflatoxin, rats could be healthy, active and cancer-free if they were fed low-protein diets. You aren’t doing yourself much good by eating organic beef instead of conventional beef that’s been pumped full of chemicals. PRINCIPLE #6 The same nutrition that prevents disease in its early stages (before diagnosis) can also halt or reverse disease in its later stages (after diagnosis). PRINCIPLE #7 Nutrition that is truly beneficial for one chronic disease will support health across the board. PRINCIPLE #8 Good nutrition creates health in all areas of our existence. All parts are interconnected. Sometimes people try to play these different parts of their lives against each other. People wonder if they can erase bad eating habits by being a runner. The answer to this is no. The benefits and risks of diet are crucially important, and more sizable, than the benefits and risks of other activities. Besides, why would anyone want to try and balance benefits and risks when they could have all the benefits, working together? Good food and good health is simple. The biology of the relationship of food and health is exceptionally complex, but the message is still simple. The recommendations coming from the published literature are so simple that I can state them in one sentence: eat a whole foods, plant-based diet, while minimizing the consumption of refined foods, added salt and added fats. Daily supplements of vitamin B12, and perhaps vitamin D for people who spend most of their time indoors and/or live in the northern climates are encouraged. For vitamin D, you shouldn’t exceed RDA limit. While I recommend that you not worry about small quantities of animal products in your food, I am not suggesting that you deliberately plan to incorporate small portions of meat into your daily diet. My recommendation is that you try to avoid all animal-based products. This mistake of characterizing whole foods by the health effects of specific nutrients is what I call reductionism. For example, the health effect of a hamburger cannot be simply attributed to the effect of a few grams of saturated fat in the meat. Saturated fat is merely one ingredient. Hamburgers also include other types of fat, in addition to cholesterol, protein and very small amounts of vitamins and minerals.","Biggest study ever on the effects of diet on health.

The Power of Less,Leo Babuta,1401309704,5,"We'll always come back to these two ideas: 1. Identify the essential 2. Eliminate the rest === 1. Focus on the essential 2. Allow everything else to drop away === 1. Set limitations 2. Choose the essential 3. Simplify 4. Focus 5. Create habits 6. Start small === By setting limitations, we must choose the essential. In everything you do, learn to set limitations. By choosing the essential, we create great impact with minimal resources. Always choose the essential to maximize your time and energy. === Ask yourself the following questions about each task: - Will this have an impact that will last beyond this week or month? - How will it change my job, my career, my life? - How will this further a long-term goal of mine? - How important is that goal? Plan your tasks so that you are doing things each day to further your long-term goals. === Limitless is weak. Learn to focus yourself with limits, and you'll increase your strength. What would you like to simplify? - time spent on phone - number of projects - number of blogs/news sources - time spent surfing/reading online === Focus : absorbed in a mindful challenge. Clear away distractions and focus completely on the task you set before yourself. HOW TO SINGLE-TASK: 1. First thing in the morning, work on your Most Important Task. Don't do anything else until this is done. Give yourself a short break, then start on your next Most Important Task. If you can get 2-3 of these done in the morning, the rest of the day is gravy. 2. Turn off all other distractions. 3. If you feel the urge to check your email or switch to another task, stop yourself. Breathe. Refocus yourself. Get back to the task at hand. PRACTICE FOCUSING: - When you eat, just eat. - Exercise is meditation. - Daily routines can be meditation. === 30-DAY CHALLENGE: 1. Select only one habit per month that will have the biggest impact on your life. 2. Write down your plan. Specifically state what your goal will be each day, when you'll do it, what your trigger will be (""right after waking""), and who you will report to 3. Post your goal publicly. 4. Report on your progress daily. Choose an easy goal. Choose something measurable. Do it at the same time every day, if possible. === THE ONE GOAL SYSTEM: Choose a goal that will take 6-12 months to complete. Break it down to focus on a smaller sub-goal that you can accomplish in the next month or two. Create a weekly goal. Each day, choose one action that will move you closer to your weekly goal. Make this action your most important task for the day. Do it first. === SIMPLE PROJECTS LIST: Choose just the top 3 projects on your list. This is your Simple Projects List. Everything else goes on a 2nd list: the On-Deck List. Don't move a project from the On-Deck List to the Simple Projects List until you finish all three projects on your Simple Projects List. Not just one, but all three. Have at least one of your top 3 projects be related to your One Goal. A project should take no more than a month to complete - preferably only a week or two. Visualize what your project will look like when done. Once a week, review your projects === MOST IMPORTANT TASKS: Choose 3 Most Important Tasks each day. Do it first thing, each day. Ensure that one Most Important Task is goal-related, or related to one of your top 3 projects. Break things down into small tasks that can be accomplished in an hour or less, preferably 20-30 minutes. Don't procrastinate, but just get started. One you start, you'll gain momentum and will have broken through the initial resistance barrier, and be much more likely to continue to the next small task, and the next one, until the large task is complete. === AN OPEN APPROACH / NO SCHEDULE: What do you do instead of keeping a schedule? Know your priorities. From moment to moment decide what you should be doing based on your priorities, how much time you have available, and your energy level. Learn to be in the moment, focusing on one task at a time, immersing yourself completely in that task. If you aren't finding yourself passionate about a certain task, allow yourself to move on to something you're more passionate about. The more passionate you are about a task or project, the more energy you'll put into it, and the better you'll do with it. === FLOW: Flow is when you lose yourself in a task, and the world around you disappears. How to get into flow: 1. Choose a task you're passionate about. 2. Choose a task that's challenging, but not too challenging. 3. Eliminate distractions. 4. Immerse yourself. Just start, and focus completely. Forget about everything else, and let the world melt away. == Reduce before you organize. Don't let smaller tasks take priority over your Most Important Tasks. Do smaller tasks in batches. Limit your in-boxes. Don't check email in the morning. == INTERNET: Which sites are time-wasters for you? You spend a lot of time there, but they're not helping you get to your goals. Consciously plan your use of the internet, instead of jumping on anytime and getting carried away without thinking. Set limits and have a pupose. Set blocks of your day for doing uninterrupted work (offline), for doing communication, for doing research, and for doing fun stuff. Be more conscious. When you think of something you want to do online, write it down to do it later. Unplug your 'net connection so that you can't just reconnect with a couple clicks of the mouse. Focus on breaking the addiction for at least one week. A month would be better. Make it your goal to break free of the internet. Set rules for using the internet, and stick to them. When you get an urge to go online, let it pass. Every urge is like a wave. Apply positive public pressure. Ask others to encourage you to stay offline. Use delay strategies. Deep breathing. Drinking water. Self-massage. Walking around. == COMMITMENTS: Reduce the commitments in your life. Viewed individually, none of them ever seems like too much work. Take inventory of your current commitments. List everything: the more honest and complete your list, the better. For each thing on the list: - how does this give my life value? - how important is it to me? - does this further my life goals? Make a short list of the commitments you choose. (""Here's mine: 1. Spending time with family, 2. Writing, 3. running, 4. Reading. That's my entire list."") Leave space between tasks. Slow down and enjoy every task. Do nothing. Don't be afraid to be lazy sometimes. === ROUTINE: With a well-planned morning routine: - You can prepare for your day & set your goals - You can get in exercise, reading, writing, or other things you don't normaly have time for. - You can do something enjoyable, calming, and relaxing. An evening routine can take as little as 10-30 minutes: - Prepare for the next day - Unwind from a long day - Review your day - Calm yourself before bed - Spend quality time with loved ones - Log, journal, write, exercise How to establish routines: 1. Focus on them as your foremost goal for one month, focusing on nothing else. 2. Make them rewarding. 3. Log your progress. == ATTENTION: Learn to focus your attention, to move it from one thing to the next more reluctantly, more slowly, at a more relaxed pace. Pick a simple task. Keep your attention on it without switching. Every time you switch your attention, take note of it. Learn to stop yourself. Practice this throughout the day, no matter what you're doing. Showering, eating, etc. === EXERCISE: Use the first month to focus exclusively on forming the exercise habit. Every month, set short-term goals for gradual improvements in exercise and diet plans. Schedule your workout time. Find a time when you'll be able to exercise, when nothing will interfere. Do 5 workouts a week. Don't allow yourself to miss a day. No matter what your goal/project, never allow yourself to miss two days in a row.",Identify the essential. Eliminate the rest. Set limitations. Become incredibly effective. Written by someone who's been successfully living this way for years.
Cut to the Chase,Stuart Levine,0385516207,5,"Whether you're writing a report, a letter, or a presentation, ask yourself: - Who's the audience? - What are they looking for? - How much detail do they want or need? - How will the information I have help them in going forward? - How much background information do they need? - Is anyone likely to be hostile toward what I have to say? - Are they familiar with industry jargons? - What kinds of examples and analogies will be most helpful to them? You can't cut to the chase unless you know to whom you are talking. Use momentum to keep major projects on course: - Make momentum part of the plan. Don't move ahead until everyone knows how to create momentum. - Grab low-hanging fruit. Select a few major ""wins"" and tackle them before doing anything else. - Go for just one big win. One important thing, and really deliver on it. - Celebrate early successes publicly. Celebrate. Congratulate everyone. Give updates and praise people involved. Which ad would catch your attention?

CLOSE THE LOOP: If your doctor says, ""We'll call you if there's a problem"" - and there's no call 2 weeks later, you're still wondering. When people don't close the loop, they leave the other person hanging. It's not only distracting, but subtly erodes the relationship. Never let yourself be known as someone who leaves other people hanging. Once that label is applied, it's hard to shake. Consistently close the loop, and build a reputation as a dependable professional. BEAT CHANGE TO THE PUNCH: Carl Jung: ""If there's a fear of falling, the only safety is deliberately jumping."" Scan trade publications and talk with peers to discover new technologies, business practices, or processes that might help you do your job better. Before you ask anyone else to be involved, ask, ""Do I really need this person's time? Can I do it on my own?"" If you need the other person, define specifically what you need. Explain why their involvement is important. Give them everything they need to get up to speed. People don't mind giving their time if they feel it's valued and helpful. It's your reponsibility to have thought that through before you approach them. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, ASK FOR IT Don't beat around the bush. Don't assume people will know what you need. Don't make them guess. The more specific you are about what you need, the faster you'll get it. If asking an employee or peer, clearly frame your request and set a deadline. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS THE MAP As if you're driving to the same destination in different cars, if everyone has the map, you don't need to wait for the slowest one. The it doesn't matter if you get separated, you all end up in the same destination. TELL THEM WHAT'S ON THE TEST Tell people how they will be measured, so they can focus on the most important things. To reinforce performance, link a portion of the compensation to their performance in those areas. CUT THE BULL Too many business conversations go nowhere because one person is afraid of offending the other. Say what you mean. Don't sugar-coat it. Make your point clearly and assertively, without being aggressive. Indirectness erodes trust and can cloud the issue. It wastes time and can hurt your career. When you've got something to say, say it and move on. Even if people don't agree with you, they'll respect you for your honesty and candor. EVERY CONVERSATION SHOULD HAVE A PURPOSE Business calls and lunches drag on long after the goal has been met. Informal meetings get sidetracked and nothing gets accomplished. Why? They failed to prepare as they would for any other meeting. Ask yourself these 4 questions well in advance of call, talk, or lunch: - What do I want to accomplish? - What do I need from the other person? - What information do I want to share with this person? - What can I do to add value for this person? One exception : if the purpose of meeting is to build a relationship, don't formally state your objective. However, make sure you've shared or learned everything you'd hoped to by meeting's end. SNAP OUT OF YOUR RUT IF... - You've grown extremely comfortable in your current role, succeeding easily without exerting yourself. - Everyone comes to you for answers, and you stop learning new things yourself. - You're happy, but waiting for something to truly test your resolve. (That something won't present itself. You need to go find it.) - Your success is overly dependent on one relationship. GOOD ENOUGH Don't let unhealthy perfectionism keep you from cutting to the chase. Know when to let things go. Will anyone but me appreciate my efforts? Can I significantly improve this if I keep working? Does the possible gain in quality outweigh the lost time? DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE If you're making a lot of different mistakes, you're learning. If you're making the same mistakes more than once, you're wasting time.",Tips on more effective communication.
Know-How,Ram Charan with Geri Willigan,0307341518,5,"You will be constantly tested for your know-how to lead your business in the right direction. Will you be able to do the right things, make the right decisions, deliver results, and leave your business and the people in it better off than they were before? Can you position your business by finding the central idea that meets customer demands and makes money? And, as will increasingly be required, can you appropriately reposition it? Are you able to pinpoint external change by detecting patterns ahead of others and put your business on the offensive? Do you know how to lead the social system of your business by getting the right people together with the right behaviors to make better, faster decisions and achieve business results? Can you judge people by finding their best talents based on facts and observations and match them with a job? Are you molding a team by getting highly competent leaders to submerge their egos and coordinate seamlessly? Do you know how to develop goals by balancing what the business can become with what it can realistically achieve, not merely looking in the rear-view mirror and making incremental adjustments to what’s been done before? Can you set laser-sharp priorities by defining the specific tasks that align resources, actions, and energy to accomplish the goals? Can you deal with forces beyond the market by creatively and positively responding to societal pressures you don’t control but that significantly impact your business? Know-How is about what you must both do and be to lead your business in what is shaping up to be the most challenging business environment in decades. It plants business leadership squarely on a foundation of profit and loss, capital utilization, resource allocation, productivity, and customer satisfaction while never losing sight of the fact that leaders are human beings. Successful leaders learn, practice, hone, and refine the know-hows until they become natural. Know-hows aren’t taught in schools, and cultivating them isn’t easy. But over time, with lots of development, the know-hows become automatic, instinctive, and superb, and judgment improves. It’s important to practice the know-hows through a series of deliberate, appropriately challenging job assignments, combined with self-reflection on your personal traits. That’s how leaders are made. The ways leaders develop and deploy the eight know-hows are especially influenced by a handful of them: ambition, drive and tenacity, self-confidence, psychological openness, realism, and an insatiable appetite for learning. Ambition - A desire to achieve something visible and noteworthy propels individual leaders and their companies to strive to reach their potential. Leaders need a healthy dose of it to push themselves and others. But ambition can be blind. That’s when you see leaders making flashy acquisitions that are financially unsound or setting attention-getting goals or taking on more priorities than the organization can handle out of a desire to do everything. Overambitiousness, combined with a lack of integrity, can lead to undesirable behavior and even corruption. Drive and tenacity – Some leaders have an inner motor that pushes them to get to the heart of an issue and find solutions. They drill for specific answers and don’t give up until they get them. Their high energy is infectious. They consistently drive their priorities through the organization. They search tenaciously for information they’re missing and keep tweaking their mental models until they arrive at a position that works. But drive and tenacity can cause a leader to stick to a plan that isn’t working or to outdated assumptions or an investment that is no longer promising. Self-confidence – You have to be able to listen to your own inner voice and endure the lonely moments when an important decision falls on your shoulders. You have to be able to speak your mind and act decisively, knowing that you can withstand the consequences. It’s not a matter of acting tough. It’s having a tough inner core, or what some refer to as emotional fortitude. Underlying fears and insecurities can be just as detrimental to your know-hows as can excessive self-confidence in the form of narcissism or arrogance. Some leaders need to be liked. They therefore tend to go easy on people. They have an especially hard time dismissing people who have been loyal to them. Such leaders often find their own progress slowed because they promote people for the wrong reasons, tolerate nonperformers, and allow the social system to corrode. Thinking encompasses a wide range of altitudes from the conceptual to the specific, they have a broad cognitive bandwidth, meaning they see things through a wide lens, and they are good at reframing issues and problems, looking at them from various points of view. But your use of the know-hows is better when you’re able to do both: think in terms of concepts, but also drill to the specifics. You see this ability in leaders who ask probing questions that hit on exactly the right points or unearth the critical but unspoken assumptions, and in those who can cut through complexity. A broad cognitive bandwidth allows you to take in a wide range of information and see things in their broader context. You can take in more complexity, and see the interconnections. You’re more likely to pick up on trends outside your industry that affect the positioning of your business and create new growth opportunities, and you’re better able to see the business and its social system holistically, rather than as separate functions. But even if your positioning is on the money today, there’s a good chance it won’t be tomorrow. Positioning is not for eternity. The frequency, depth, and abruptness of change in the world today means that you will be frequently shaping and reshaping your business. Spotting new opportunities for profitable growth, resegmenting markets, and deciding which technologies to adopt. The clarity and specificity of positioning of a company in the mind of the consumer, employees, and other constituencies is paramount. Too often a shift in positioning (sometimes originating because of the change of company leadership) in a relatively stable environment can cause a permanent blurring of the company’s value proposition in the eyes of customers. The early warning signals come, for example, when customers start going somewhere else. It’s easy to see why people working in an industry for many years can develop psychological blockages and fail to see bigger trends. For example, a veteran newspaper leader who is overly optimistic and too self-confident will see the precipitous decline in one major source of revenue as an aberration, rationalizing that the business is just going through a flat period. Figuring out what the new composition of revenues will be, from what sources, and what the new cost structure will be to continue to make money. You have to be aware that in such an uncertain situation, there’s a high likelihood that the behavior of some players may be totally irrational. You have to be open, receptive, and active in searching for the signs that the business is being shifted or needs to be. You need to be surrounded with people whose conversations with you help you wrestle with these issues in a brutally honest manner. Regular visits to client CEOs and business leaders provide a stream of new insights. Whitman himself made 234 of these personal visits by early 2006. Such closeness to the market will help him and his team detect early on any breaks in the external landscape and whether and when it will be time again to reposition the business. He had been asking, “What costs can we cut?” He realized that a better question was “Where could we win?” Early warning signals that the positioning of your business may need to change to take advantage of emerging opportunities: Nascent industries emerge. Nontraditional competitors start to appear. The positioning of a key competitor changes. The rise of new customers. Consumption patterns are being influenced by affordable new offerings from new technologies (think iPod). Customers are defecting. Loss of market share in select key segments. Emergence of new business models and new management models. Pressure on profit margins. Unexpected decline in cash flow from operations. Decline in customer satisfaction. Only by looking out far over the horizon and taking into account developing trends that may not seem directly relevant now can you really do the kind of analysis necessary to prepare for rapid change and new opportunities. You have to look at your business from the outside in. How would it all play out? Seidenberg had to think through all those nonquantifiable factors, sifting, sorting, and selecting what information could help him decide what will prevail, in what conditions, with what timing, and with a sharp focus on changing customer-buying behavior. In addition he had to take into consideration competitors, emerging coalitions of rivals, and special interest groups. One way to become effective in the know-how of seeing emerging patterns is to be an active listener who continually searches for what is new and different. Seidenberg has said that in every conversation he looks for ideas he has never heard before. Recognize how you have obtained information in the past. Did you seek it out, or did you just let it come to you? Reading each item carefully and slowly and then thinking about what it means for your company and your industry. What is changing and for whom? Where is the opportunity in that change and for whom? It’s a simple exercise that over time helps condition your brain to detect patterns from these observations and what they mean for various businesses and industries. In my observation, people who create organic growth that is profitable and sustainable connect the dots sooner and are on the offensive. Seven simple questions can help you sort through and detect patterns in the complex world around you: 1.What is happening in the world today? 2.What part of my frame of reference has worked for me? What hasn’t worked for me? a.When you experience a failure in detecting a change – and you will – you need to reflect on why you missed it. 3.What does it mean for anyone? 4.What does it mean for us? 5.What would have to happen? 6.What do we have to do to play a role? 7.What do we do next? Leaders who connect the dots: Have a methodology for anticipating and detecting breaks in the continuity of the external landscape. Imagine one or more pictures of the future and pinpoint the gaps that make the picture incomplete. Have a reliable, diverse social network – both inside and outside the business. Talk to their network for ideas about how to close gaps that they identify. Have the personal imagination to construct patterns from emerging disparate trends, always searching for the missing links and missing ingredients. Are psychologically self-aware of potential bias on their part or that of people they associate with to be overly optimistic or pessimistic, thereby distorting a realistic perception of external trends. Connect patterns of change with the question of whether the positioning of the business could become irrelevant or obsolete. Perhaps the biggest untapped opportunity for your success as a leader is shaping the way people work together to deliver the numbers. Your own performance depends on your ability to get other people to commit to and deliver their common goals. Understanding the social system of your business is the best way to get a handle on the otherwise mysterious subject of managing and changing how people work together to meet ever-changing business requirements. Managing the social system has two parts. You have to be able to determine what critical decisions and trade-offs must get made, and by whom, to accomplish your business goals. Then you use that insight to design disciplined, routine, regularly scheduled meetings – I call them operating mechanisms – to bring the right people together at the right frequency with the right information to make those decisions. Shape the content of these discussions and ensure that the right behaviors are taking place in them and the output links to results. In short, you have to actively design and lead the social system of your business. A leader with this know-how will always investigate the social system to see if it is the source of the problem and take specific steps to fix it. Map your operating mechanisms, ensure that each of them is geared around a business result, and diagnose how each of them is actually working. If new ones are required or existing ones are obsolete, it’s your job to change them. And if the people are not having the right discussions in them or behaving in the right way, it’s your job to correct the behaviors, using persuasion, power, and rewards, whether money, recognition, or promotion, as necessary. That’s how the social system changes – through your conscious actions in designing and redesigning the operating mechanisms and conducting the dialogue in a way that shapes people’s behaviors. As you do this repetitively, with discipline, you change the quality and substance of business decisions, and because the behaviors that get shaped in the operating mechanisms carry over to people’s everyday work, you sustain a change in how people work together. With this know-how, you accomplish the elusive goal of culture change and develop the ability to deliver on commitments and achieve business results. What was far more important was what information is exchanged, how much freedom is created for people to opine, what new information is brought from outside, how candor is valued by the leader, and the know-how of the leader to draw everybody in, surface conflicts, and get the group to be decisive without making poor compromises. You also have to establish and enforce what behaviors are acceptable and which are not. You do this through conducting dialogue. You have to be able to perceive when a person’s behavior is going off the track and have the emotional fortitude to correct it face-to-face, often right there on the spot. Through dialogue, people can see what you, the leader, think is important. 1.What is the purpose of the existing operating mechanisms and how do they and their linkages combine to help deliver results? 2.Which ones should be kept, eliminated, or combined? 3.Which require a total redesign and a new way to lead them? 4.Are there new operating mechanisms that should be installed? You will have to design operating mechanisms around your more important business activities, such as serving new markets and achieving new growth. Each operating mechanism must have a clear business purpose. Using simple facilitation techniques – “Pat, I haven’t heard from you yet”- he went out of his way to draw people out. Short, frequent, content-rich meetings can be highly effective in distributing fast-changing information and are especially useful for staying in touch with the outside world. When you need different business results, you almost always have to tinker with the social system. He couldn’t just set a goal and expect it to be delivered. He had to be sure the organization’s social system was built for getting it done. Asking what had happened the previous week and what the leaders were planning to do in the upcoming week, so the business was making adjustments in a much shorter time frame. In each subsequent meeting, he would ask whether the leaders had done what they said they were going to do, creating a sense of urgency and accountability to the group. As Nardelli selected leaders, he kept a keen eye on their know-how in managing a social system and their tendency to be psychologically open, willing to be influenced by others, and intellectually honest in keeping the group focused on the business purpose. Does Your Social System Pass the Test? The built-in conflicts that are part of every organization are being surfaced. These conflicts are resolved in a timely way by people committed to delivering results. Information flows horizontally across silos and is not hoarded or deliberately distorted. The right questions are raised so that you can look at your business from both “50,000 feet” (the big picture) and at ground level and conduct brutally honest dialogue. Operating mechanisms are designed so that they result in high quality, timely decisions and help deliver the aspired results. You know the points of intersection where operating mechanisms are needed for people to make trade-offs and share information. Appropriate and continuous improvements are made in the working of the operating mechanisms: creating new ones, combining some, eliminating others. Each operating mechanism is connected in an unfiltered way to sources of external information. Leaders have the psychological courage to confront reality and shape behavior of participants in line with the value of the business. The right behavior and values are reinforced and those who deviate are dealt with. You must take the initiative to provide opportunities for them to not only contribute to the organization, but also to be tested and hopefully expanded. If they reach a limit – maybe because certain know-hows didn’t develop properly or personality traits got in the way – you then deal with this issue as well. The usually way of deploying people’s leadership talent is to start with a job opening and see who can fill it. But the know-how of selecting leaders and helping them reach their potential means focusing on people first, not jobs – actively searching for leadership talent throughout your organization, creating for those individuals career moves that test their ability to take on more complexity or learn new skills, and creating processes to do it on a disciplined, regular basis. You have to develop and improve your judgments on people, which means spending time and energy on it daily, weekly, monthly, not just during one-a-year talent reviews or succession-planning sessions. You have to create a view about the person’s competence in the know-hows, but also look at him more broadly to see what makes him tick: what he loves to do, how he thinks, how he behaves around others. Then you can match the leader to the job in which that person will shine and strengthen business performance. As you practice and improve your observational powers, you have to prevent your own psychological blockages from getting in the way or perceiving people accurately. You can’t afford to lock into unrealistically positive or negative views of people, thinking “he can do not right” or “she can do no wrong,” and discounting information to the contrary. People grow and change, and jobs continually evolve, so you have to be psychologically open to continuously update your judgments on people and their fit with the job. See the person as a whole, over time, in a variety of situations, and work backward from what you observe to determine what that person’s individual gifts really are. Crosscheck your judgments by soliciting different viewpoints about key people. First nail down the person’s natural talents and tendencies, and then look for situations that will allow those things to develop and take off. If the negatives are really getting in the way of job performance or growth, you can give the person coaching to see if they can be corrected. People learn as much if not more from adversity as from success. People who’ve had setbacks shouldn’t be discounted without probing into the specifics of the situation. The principles involved to mold a team of leaders: Share numbers, reasoning, and results to shape a common view of the business and its context. Have the psychological courage to confront behaviors that harm the team’s effectiveness. Anticipate, surface, and resolve conflicts. Pick the right people. Provide prompt feedback and coaching. Recognize and avoid derailers. It takes an enormous effect and sustained repetition to get every member of the team to arrive at the same point. At first team members will see and hear what you are saying through the lens of their job specialty and select only what seems to apply to them. Develop an internal team dialogue in which each member contributes to the discussion. But the value of a team and your ability to lead it is that a decision can be reached that allows everyone to voice an opinion, debate the merits, and the right choice emerges. The group makes better decisions than individuals and no one person has all the information. But people can be reluctant to offer opinions or comments in a group setting where they may be challenged or, worse, ridiculed. Those who do speak out can become committed too early to a position and be unwilling or unable to retreat. Goals have to be of the right type and magnitude to be both achievable as well as motivational. Unlike many leaders who set grandiose goals and implore others to achieve them, Immelt established aggressive goals only after he assessed how the organization might go after them. The granularity of the thinking makes all the difference. The goals were realistic at every stage, and realism eventually earns credibility, just as surely as unfulfilled promises destroy it. The goals must be clearly defined with specific time frames at the start. Sometimes the view from below is a wake-up call for high-level leaders. Sometimes you might want to set goals that build the self-confidence of the organization. Usually that means goals that you are almost certain can be accomplished. When they are, the organization gets energized. Over time you can increase the goals as you simultaneously increase the self-confidence, and eventually you can begin setting stretch goals. Stretch goals show people that they can accomplish more than they thought they could. The point is not to get people to work harder. Rather, it is to get people to do things differently and thus raise the capability of the organization. Such a goal carries with it higher risks. Unless you do the mental gymnastics necessary to figure out what has to radically change, setting a stretch goal won’t be credible and the organization won’t trust you. You have to be sure that people are prepared to think differently and have sufficient resources to accomplish the goals. Setting the right goals means frequently rethinking every assumption about the market, the competition, and the business environment. Take a broad look at what is on the horizon two or more years out, then work backward to visualize what you think the organization can achieve in that context, both over the longer term and in the interim. Priorities are the pathway for accomplishing goals. They provide the road map that organizes and directs the business towards its goals. When the priorities are unmistakably clear and specific, people know what to focus on and, therefore, what should get their attention, resources, and follow-through. Goals are set at fifty thousand feet. Priorities are set at ground level where you must have the tenacity, attitude and willingness to probe the messy details to think through and define what the most important actions should be. Priorities determine how resources are allocated and thus have the potential for touching off clashes as resources are moved from one person to another. While the priorities must be absolutely clear, very specific, and, above all, doable, that isn’t enough. Once set, you must repeat the priorities over and over again and follow through on them to be sure that people understand them, buy into them, and act on them so the organization executes them and doesn’t deviate from the course the priorities set. What is important, what is urgent, what is long-term versus short-term, and what is realistic versus visionary. “A very important part of this process is to be very specific and very clear. We learned that you have to repeat things a lot. You have to create communication channels that have consistency to keep the priorities from changing. At first, people understand them differently depending on their mindset. You have to be repetitive and consistent until they all understand what they need to do.” “First you have to open up their minds and convince them you are listening. Too often in the past someone might say ‘This is worrying me’ and the leader would say ‘We’ll deal with that later.’ Now we have to know to stop and say instead ‘Why are you worried?’ and work it out right then.” That’s why clear, specific priorities with a time frame are so useful. They help build confidence. Anyone can state a priority. It is only when resources are applied to it that it really becomes one. People announce priorities but find it psychologically difficult to take resources from someone and give them to someone else. You need to have a process to ensure that the necessary shifts take place. You have to monitor in your regular reviews that the shift is continuing to happen and that priorities are being executed.",Acquired expertise in big business. Subtitle: 8 Skills That Separate People Who Perform from Those Who Don't.
The Art of Project Management,tt Berkun,0596007868,5,"=========== SCHEDULES ============ Schedules serve 3 functions : allow for commitments to be made, for people to see their work as a contribution to the whole, tracking of progress. Schedules give the team a tool to track progress and to break work into manageable chunks. Big schedules should be divided into small schedules to minimize risks, increase frequency of adjustments. Breaking things down into one-or-two day sizes helps people understand what the work is that they need to do. A good schedule gives a clearer view of the project, flushes out challenges and oversights, and makes it more likely that good things will happen. For ANY project, break the available time into three equal parts: (1) DESIGN, (2) IMPLEMENTATION, (3) TESTING. The zero-sum nature of projects surfaces : adding new features requires more than just a programmer implementing them, there are unavoidable design and testing costs that someone has to pay. The earlier estimates are made, the less accurate they are, but rough estimates are the only way to make a starting point for better ones. When schedules slip, there were hidden or ignored costs that were never accounted for. Schedules should be made with skepticism. Create detailed schedules for limited periods of time only. A schedule doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough for the team and leaders to believe in, provide a basis for tracking and making adjustments, and have a probability of success that satisfies the client. If leaders acknowledge weak estimates in the schedule, and are comfortable with greater schedule risk, there's nothing wrong with weak estimates. On smaller, faster projects, rough estimates may be enough. Good estimates are everyone's business, and it should be the work of the entire team. Lack of clarity on higher-level objectives has a direct influence on the low-level assumptions programmers make. QUESTIONS THAT HELP CATCH SCHEDULE PROBLEMS: * Were sick days, holidays and vacation time for all contributors included? * Do individuals have access to the schedule, and asked to report regular progress? * Is someone watching overall schedule on daily/weekly basis? * Does the team feel ownership and commitment to the schedule? (If not, did they contribute?) * Do leaders add more feature requests than they help eliminate? Do leaders say ""no"" to new work and provide a philosophy to the team for how to respond to new (late) requests? * Are people on the team encouraged to say ""no"" to new work requests that don't fit the goals and vision? * Are there moments in the schedule when adjustments and renegotiations can take place by leaders? * Are specs and design plans good enough for engineering to make good work estimates? * Is engineering trained in making good work estimates? ============= WHAT TO DO : REQUIREMENTS, STATEMENTS ============== The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build. A requirement is a carefully written description of a criterion that the work is expected to satisfy. Good requirements are easy to understand and hard to misinterpret. Vision documents directly define the ""what"" of a project. Specs define the ""how"" of a project. Work breakdowns define the ""how"" of a project, from a team perspective. Specs are complete when they provide a workable plan that engineering can use to fulfill requirements. A vision document is where all of the perspectives, research, and strategy are synthesized together. The simplest tool is the use of requirements. A requirement is anything the team (and client) agrees will be satisfied when the project is completed. Problem statements are 1-2 sentence descriptions of specific end-user issues, written in a format that identifies a problem or need from the customer perspective. Problem statements are broader than bugs, because their goal is to capture what's missing from the customer perspective, instead of only what's broken from the technical perspective. Problem statements should remain purely about customers and their needs. Problem statements need to be converted into feature statements / scenarios. Feature statement is a short description of something a customer will be able to do as a result of the project or tasks they will no longer have to do because the project automates those tasks for them. Avoid any description of how these benefits will be achieved. Feature statements should never describe a specific solution or design, but should instead explain the solution's impact on the customer. Require a temporary ban on solution proposals during discussions of problem lists and scenarios. Postpone discussion about design alternatives. Focus on clarifying the real goals of the project, ordered by importance. Problem statements and scenarios are a simple way to define and communicate requirements. They are easily converted into design ideas without losing clarity about what's important and what isn't. ============= WRITING THE VISION ===================== The challenge of project management is not only to get things started up in the right direction, but also to keep it headed that way. Writing things down makes it possible to define engineering work or capture the overall objectives for entire teams only once, then reuse that knowledge many times. SIMPLYFYING : The vision should have a simplifying effect on the project. A good vision will provide answers to the core questions individuals have, and will give them a tool for making decisions in their own work. GOAL-DRIVEN : A well-written goal defines a clear intention. Enough information is provided in the goal itself, that people will know when it's been completed. The fewer high-level goals, the more powerful the vision document becomes. Try playing devil's advocate : ask how a project can still fail if its goal is satisfied as written. Consider if there is a way to more carefully phrase the goal. INSPIRATIONAL : Give the reader a clear understanding of the opportunities that exist. Provide a solid plan for exploiting it. Make everyone understand the real-world problem to be solved, not just the technical one. MEMORABLE : The ideas need to make sense and be interesting. Resonate with the reader. If the vision is too complex, it's impossible to achieve this effect. Be direct and honest. Clear and confident. Give the team strong concepts and ways of thinking about the work. KEY POINTS TO COVER: * What is the one sentence that defines this specific release of this specific project? * How does this project contribute to the goals of the organization? * Why is this project more relevant than anothers that also might contribute to the goals of the organization? * What customer features are essential to this project? (Priority #1) * What customer features are desired but not essential? (Priority #2) * What solutions for customers have been requested but will definitely not be a part of this project? * Who are the customers? * What problems does this solve for them? * How will customers get their job done without this project? * Why will these customers buy this service? * Who are the competitors? * How will this project compare to theirs? * How is this NOT a technology in search of a problem? * What is the project NOT going to accomplish? (List things people might assume would be part of the project, but won't be.) * What are some likely ways for this project to fail, and how will they be avoided or minimized? * Who else is this project depending on in order to succeeed? * Who else is depending on this project in order to succeeed? * What assumptions are being made that the project depends on? VISUAL: We forget the power of images in expressing ideas. The best vision documents include visual images. Filmmakers use storyboards for the same purpose. Showing a sketch of the final thing allows ever individual to put his own work in a larger context. If this end result cannot be visualized, the vision is not clear. DAILY WORSHIP: Keep the vision visible : the few core goals should be up on posters in highly visible places. Ask the following questions at every meeting: 1. Does the vision accurately reflect our goals and intentions for this project? 2. Is the vision helping people make decisions and reject requests that are out of scope? 3. Are there changes to the vision docs that would make #1 and #2 true? The vision should not be modified frequently. Major changes should be rare after the project is moving at full speed.",The best book on how to oversee projects to completion.
The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy,Donald Robertson,036721914X,4,"Consider civilization as having begun when man first did things to further the well-being of other men. CBT is concerned with helping clients to deal with irrational or disturbing emotions, and to cultivate rational, healthy, and proportionate ones in their stead. Behavioural experiments and empirical observation. Beliefs should be tested out in practice, in the laboratory of our personal experience. Cognitive activity affects behavior. Cognitive activity may be monitored and altered. Desired behavior change may be affected through cognitive change. Do the following: 1. monitor negative automatic thoughts, or cognitions 2. evaluate the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and actions 3. carefully evaluate the evidence for and against distorted or maladaptive cognitions 4. generate alternative cognitions and to substitute them for the negative ones 5. identify and modify underlying dysfunctional assumptions and beliefs which predispose to negative automatic thoughts. Enchiridion: “Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them”. Hamlet: “There's nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so”. The role of responsibility, rationality, and self-disciplined observation of one's mind as a means of modifying irrational emotions and achieving psychological well-being Human emotions are based on ideas. Control of most intense feelings may be achieved by changing one's ideas. Nothing lies completely in their power except their judgements and desires and goals. Nothing outside the mind or volition can, of its own nature, constrain or frustrate us unless we choose to let it Epictetus begins by explaining the Stoic view that our judgements and opinions are pre-eminently within our power to control, whereas external events, especially sources of wealth and reputation, are ultimately in the hands of Fortune. Hence, the Stoic should always strive to cope with adversity by having ready “at hand” precepts that remind him “what is mine, and what is not mine, what is within my power, and what is not” (Discourses, 1.1.21). Indeed, Epictetus goes as far as to define Stoicism itself as the study of this distinction Learn what things are our own, and what are not. Though it may have taken a lifetime to study the subtle implications of Stoic philosophy, its basic tenets were intended to be summed up in a few words. Emotional disturbance is the result of mindlessly becoming absorbed in external events, being overly attached to sensory pleasure, wealth, and the praise of others, and overly anxious about pain, poverty, and criticism. Epictetus compares the mind to a bottle of water with a ray of light shining through it, representing our perception of external events. If the water is shaken, the light is refracted and disturbed. Likewise, when our mind, judgements, and perceptions are internally disturbed, external events look disturbing to us. We project our feelings on to external events. The sage sees everything in the same light because his mind is constant and he refuses to attach undue importance to anything outside his control. If you want anything good, get it from yourself. The attainment of self-awareness and self-control.","After learning about Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy from the “… for Dummies” book, I wanted to see how it was applied to Stoicism. The book did not disappoint, and is a good reinforcement of the mindset."
The New York Nobody Knows,William Helmreich,0691169705,4,"A city is an outdoor museum. You cannot merely walk through a city to know it. You have to stop long enough to absorb what’s going on around you. And the only way to do that is to immerse yourself in it - spending as much time as possible in the streets; hanging out where others gather; attending meetings, concerts, sporting events, and the like; in short, doing what those who live there do. Because I wanted their answers to be spontaneous and relaxed, I would say something like: “How come you’re dressed like this?” or “Is this neighborhood safe?” or “Do you find this job boring?” People don’t pay close attention to what you say as long as you say something. I would ask someone if I could use their bathroom because I was going to a wedding. The energy emanates from the immigrants and the gentrifiers. The immigrants, with their often incredible drive and ambitions, which are, in turn, fueled by the dreams they have of changing the trajectory of their own lives for the better. The ambivalence felt by outer borough residents toward Manhattan has greatly diminished. Groups who have been hostile to one another in the homeland have dramatically different relationships here. The conflicts back home seem irrelevant in the American context. Many see their move to America as an opportunity to develop friendships that they had once considered unthinkable. New Yorkers think of their communities as if they were miniature countries. An attempt to manage the realities of living in a large anonymous place through creating a space that they can identify with and truly call home. A neighborhood’s attractiveness: that sense of community is all about friendliness, warmth, and pride in where they live. More than three million people having arrived in NYC since the 1960s. The immigrants’ energy and ambition to remake their lives and to achieve their dreams have had a major impact on the city, giving it a certain dynamism that can be felt by anyone who walks the streets, especially the teeming neighborhoods in which they have settled. This has the unintended but real consequence of decreasing the opportunities for Puerto Ricans and African Americans who have been mired in poverty here, sometimes for generations, The immigrants tend to live among their own kind. This is partly because of the comfort level they feel when they do so and partly because of the fact that certain groups have come in waves over a short period of time. Gentrifiers and the poor with whom they live are neighbors but rarely friends, other than hello or a quick superficial exchange of pleasantries. Each has its own group with whom they have much more in common. And there is a perception that the gentrifiers are snobby and look down on them. Block associations are an integral part of city life and they play a major role in the stability of communities. Neighborhoods often look and feel completely different in the evening than they do in the daytime, in different seasons, and on weekdays as opposed to weekends. The people, the activities, the look, the safety factor, everything, can change. Chess has gained significantly in popularity, especially among blacks. Dominoes is ubiquitous in Hispanic communities. It’s in the parks, with their peaceful atmosphere, that the warmth and openness of the city comes into clearer view. Everything seems to be occurring in slow motion in contrast to the speed at which the city normally moves.",Fascinating if you want to get to know NYC better. Author walked every single block of every borough in New York City. 6000 miles. Talked with everyone he could along the way. Shares his experience and insights here.
The Alter Ego Effect,Todd Herman,0062838636,4,"Sacrifice what you are for what you could become. Suspend who you’ve been and let another version of yourself show up. Be intentional about who (what kind of person) needs to show up - what characteristics that will help you succeed. What are the traits, capabilities, skills, attitudes, beliefs, values, and all the other bits and pieces that you need to succeed? Someone changing something is wanting: Stopping, Starting, Continuing, Less of, More of. We live in four planes: Thinking, feeling, doing, and experiencing. Combine them to ask yourself what you want. (Stop doing, start doing, continue thinking, experience less of, feel more of, etc.) It could be double-negatives like “Stop seeing my day wasted.” End-in-mind: definine your final outcome or goal, then work backward from that target to build a strategy and plan to reach the goal. If you’re walking aimlessly, it’s most likely because you haven’t defined a destination, goal, or outcome and you’re just doing. Work backward to map out a plan with the steps that will ensure it happens. Moments of Impact: the actions, opportunities, events, situations, or expectations with the greatest impact on your success. Moments of Impact are filled with the most resistance, most emotion, and most challenge because they occur when you might be the most vulnerable. (Putting your words on paper and writing, Making a speech in front of a crowd, Investing your money, speaking publicly, networking or meeting someone for the first time.) These moments will give you the highest rate of return. Are administrative tasks your Moments of Impact? Probably not. They’re responsibilities, but they’re not going to catapult your career. Those tasks can be the obstacles to your Moment of Impact. Name your psychological enemy. Make it something to defeat, something to overcome, something to battle against. Humiliate it. Make the Enemy as small as possible. There is no faster way to evoke a strong emotion than to tell or hear a compelling story. We feel stories. Those emotions prompt us to act. I cared so much about what other people thought of me and whether they liked me that it held me back. “If I did that, my people would think I’m a sellout.” Have indifference to the opinions of others. The good things we build end up building us. We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. If you’re not willing to risk the unusual, you’ll have to settle for the ordinary. People have a hard time answering: “What do you want?” But if you ask, “What don’t you want?”, you get a flood of don’ts: It’s so much easier to create a Don’t Want list. When naming what you want, sound egotistical. (People fear sounding egotistical when naming what they want, and therefore don't say what they really want. So to counteract that, aim to sound egotistical.) What you need to believe to make those actions effortless, joyful, or more comfortable? Valuing action over perfection? More optimistic about your ability to make a difference? Love failing, because you know you’re improving and taking action! Imagine the specific behaviors and actions that you’re taking in your Extraordinary World. The obsession with “happiness” is causing people to feel empty. People who pursued activities only for personal pleasure lacked a sense of meaning in their lives. The motivations of all the great heroes: Trauma, Destiny, Altruism, or Self-expression. Self-expression is “I wonder what I can do/create/find?” — motivated to uncover “what they’re made of” and love the creative, athletic, or scientific process. Negative emotions like rage and anger can be incredibly motivating, especially in the beginning, when you’re taking a new action and trying to build momentum. Whatever gets you moving is all that matters. Your “why” has to be deeply meaningful to you.. Asking yourself challenging or difficult questions like “what do you want?” or “why do you want something?” can tie you up in a psychological knot. Self-distancing helps: take a step back when thinking about past experiences and reason about them from the perspective of a distanced observer, akin to a fly on the wall. “Why does ‘Jane’ want to write bestselling novels?” “What’s the purpose of ‘Todd’s’ life?” This third-person language creates an observer-type effect and can allow you to gain perspective. Start with someone you already admire and ask yourself why. The best Alter Ego is the one you have the deepest emotional connection with. If you were prolific at what you do: How would you think about yourself? What attitudes would you have about business? Your skills in business? What beliefs would you have? How would you carry yourself physically? What propels your Alter Ego to stand up to the Enemy and to defeat it at every turn? Your Alter Ego’s Origin Story. Don’t overlook the power of using placebo to trigger your Alter Ego. Write out a Response Proclamation in response to the question, “Who do you think you are?” It can be from your history or your Alter Ego’s history. Go to a local coffee shop as your Alter Ego. Meditate as your Alter Ego.","Great idea: that you should create an inner hero that you bring out when performing. Athletes do this: when they compete they are “The Ghost Panther” (or whatever) in their mind, not their normal self. I've done and prescribed this for 20 years, so it's cool to read a book on the subject. The point is simple. The book is filled with many anecdotes."
Barking Up the Wrong Tree,Eric Barker,0062416049,4,"Following the rules doesn’t create success; it just eliminates extremes - both good and bad. You must give up everything else. Silicon Valley is based on character defects that are rewarded uniquely in this system. We gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories. Spending so much time and hard work on anything nonessential has an element of obsession to it. Full-blown mania renders people unable to function in normal society. But hypomania produces a relentless, euphoric, impulsive machine that explodes toward its goals while staying connected with reality. Invest in strength versus lack of weakness. Losing a parent at a young age : such a tragedy instills in a child the feeling that the world is not safe and that an immense amount of energy and effort will be needed to survive. Orphans overcompensate and turn tragedy into fuel for greatness. The more hours per day you spend doing what you’re good at, the less stressed you feel and the more you laugh, smile, and feel you’re being treated with respect. Know what type of person you are and your signature strengths. People surveyed say effort is the number-one predictor of success, but research shows it’s actually one of the worst. Ethics books are 25% more likely to be stolen than the average library book. Pick the environments that work for you. The place you pick matters enormously. The quality of a society is more important than your place in that society. Once trust goes, everything goes. BOOK: “The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates” Contrary to conventional wisdom, pirate life was orderly and honest. People were asked how much they trusted others on a scale of one to ten. Income was highest among those who responded with the number eight. Those who responded with a number above an eight were more likely to be taken advantage of. By doing all their good deeds one day a week, Givers make sure assisting others doesn’t hamper their own achievements.",Some thoughts on success.
Tools of Titans,Tim Ferriss,1328683788,4,"Information without emotion isn’t retained. Siddhartha’s answers: “I can think” - Having good rules for decision-making, and having good questions you can ask yourself and others. “I can wait” - Being able to plan long-term, play the long game, and not misallocate your resources. “I can fast” - Being able to withstand difficulties and disaster. Training yourself to be uncommonly resilient and have a high pain tolerance. Fast for 5 days, 2 to 3 times per year. Fast for 3 days once per month, and 5-to-7 days once per quarter. Entheogens work as amplifiers. Authentic expressions of the psyche revealing its functioning on levels not ordinarily available for observation If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present. Depression may be the body’s way of saying, ‘You better deal with something, because it’s making you really sad.’ “If you get the answer, you should hang up the phone.” In other words, when you get the message you need, you shouldn’t keep asking until you’ve used the clarity gained to make meaningful changes. There’s no point in going to a motivational seminar if you’re not going to take any next steps. Is that a dream or a goal? Because a dream is something you fantasize about that will probably never happen. A goal is something you set a plan for, work toward, and achieve. Going on stage: “My work isn’t done tonight. My work was done 3 months ago, and I just have to show up.” If you don’t do something well, don’t do it unless you want to spend the time to improve. “What am I continuing to do myself that I’m not good at?” Improve it, eliminate it, or delegate. The opposite of play isn’t work. It’s depression. The King of Kong is one of Kevin Kelly’s favorite documentaries of all time. Do less formal practice than you are capable of to keep the practice from becoming a burden. If practice feels like a chore, it’s not sustainable. Impatience in dealing with frustration is the primary reason that most people fail to achieve their goals. The secret is to show up, do the work, and go home. A blue collar work ethic married to indomitable will. Nothing can sway you from your purpose. Once the decision is made, simply refuse to budge. Refuse to compromise. Commit to a long-term goal, not to a series of smaller intermediate goals. Throw out a timeline. It will take what it takes. If the commitment is to a long-term goal and not to a series of smaller intermediate goals. Sacca, on having a getaway place: “I wanted to go on offense. I wanted to have the time to focus, to learn the things I wanted to learn, to build what I wanted to build, and to really invest in relationships that I wanted to grow, rather than just doing a day of coffee after coffee after coffee.” Smart people should make things. If you let your learning lead to knowledge, you become a fool. Let your learning lead to action. Develop more skill, more ability, more insight, more capacity. “Prime” your state first. Biochemistry will help you tell yourself an enabling story. Only then do you think on strategy, as you’ll see the options instead of dead ends. In a lowered emotional state, we only see the problems, not solutions. “Priming” my state is often as simple as doing 5 to 10 push-ups or getting 20 minutes of sun. 3 minutes: Focusing on three things that I’m going to make happen, my ‘three to thrive.’ See it as though it’s already been done, feel the emotions. If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead and rotten, either write things worth reading, or do things worth writing. Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes. One Philosopher to Start With: Ludwig Wittgenstein. Solve the simplest, easiest, and most valuable problem. Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious. Once you have many people doing something, you have lots of competition and little differentiation. You, generally, never want to be part of a popular trend. How do I become less competitive in order that I can become more successful? Never let a convention be a shortcut for truth. We always need to ask: Is this true? Be a meaningful specific instead of a wandering generality. What’s the smallest possible footprint I can get away with? What is the smallest possible project that is worth my time? What is the smallest group of people who I could make a difference for, or to? Schools are teaching them to be cogs in an economy that doesn’t want cogs anymore. From 3 p.m. to 10 p.m., those kids are getting homeschooled. And they’re either getting home-schooled and watching The Flintstones, or they’re getting homeschooled and learning something useful. Teach kids two things: 1) how to lead 2) how to solve interesting problems. Give kids interesting problems to solve. And then, don’t criticize them when they fail. If you’ve formulated intelligent rules, follow your own rules. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things. Make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix. At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal. Creativity is an infinite resource. The more you spend,the more you have. Build shows around the answer(s) to “What’s weird about this story?” I give away 98% of my material for free and, then, many of my flagship courses are extremely expensive. In fact, 10 to 100 times what my competitors charge. When you complain, nobody wants to help you. Measurement of “disruptive”: For each $1 of revenue you generate, can you cost an incumbent $5 to $10? Say little, do much. Don’t accept the norms of your time. Life Is Elsewhere by Milan Kundera: “I think it’s an analogy for that choice we all have in life: Are you going to fulfill your potential? Or, are you just going to give into the peer pressure of the moment and become nothing?” Neil edits his writing in three phases: 1. I edit for me. (What do I like?) 2. I edit for my fans. (What would be most enjoyable and helpful to my fans?) 3. I edit for my haters. (What would my detractors try and pick apart, discredit, or make fun of?) Eminem impersonates the critics and then answers them. When given a choice, take both. Multiple projects lead to multiple successes. When forced to compromise, ask for more. If you can’t win, change the rules. If you can’t change the rules, then ignore them. “No” simply means begin again at one level higher. The faster you move, the slower time passes, the longer you live. The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself. You get what you incentivize. The day before something is a breakthrough, it’s a crazy idea. If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it. In excess, most things take on the characteristics of their opposite. Thus: Pacifists become militants. Freedom fighters become tyrants. Blessings become curses. Help becomes hindrance. More becomes less. To explore this concept more, read up on Aristotle’s golden mean. Making health #1 50% of the time doesn’t work. It’s absolutely all-or-nothing. If it’s #1 50% of the time, you’ll compromise precisely when it’s most important not to. Saying ‘no’ often requires trading popularity for respect. If you want to be tougher mentally, it is simple: Be tougher. Don’t meditate on it. Have a running list of three people that you’re always watching: 1. someone senior to you that you want to emulate 2. a peer who you think is better at the job than you are and who you respect 3. someone subordinate who’s doing the job you did—one, two, or three years ago—better than you did it. If you just have those three individuals that you’re constantly measuring yourself off of, and you’re constantly learning from them, you’re going to be exponentially better than you are. If the day is terrible, but I worked out, at the end of the day I’ll go, ‘Well, I had a good workout,’ Mindfulness by Mark Williams and Danny Penman. This book is a friendly and accessible introduction to mindfulness meditation, and includes an 8-week guided meditation course. Meditate with your eyes open looking at a clear sky or any place where you can see the horizon. Wisdom is nothing more than the ability to take your own advice. It’s very hard to follow the advice that you know is good. If someone came to me with my list of problems, I would be able to sort that person out very easily. Any great idea that’s significant, that’s worth doing, for Stewart Brand, will last about 5 years, from the time he thinks of it, to the time he stops thinking about it. if you think of it in terms of 5-year projects, you can count those off on a couple hands, Use an spreadsheet to display your own death countdown clock. Memento mori—remember that you’re going to die. One manual project that every human should experience? You need to build your own house. Write to get ideas, not to express them. Write in order to think. Don’t actually know what you think until you try and write. Make a list of what everyone thinks is true or will be true, and ask “What if that weren’t true?” for each, brainstorming the ramifications. Many people are working very hard, trying to save their money to retire so they can travel. I decided to flip it around and travel when I was really young, when I had zero money. ‘Productive’ is for your middle ages. When you’re young, you want to be prolific and make and do things, but you don’t want to measure them in terms of productivity. You want to measure them in terms of extreme performance, you want to measure them in extreme satisfaction. Tell everybody what you’re doing. You try to give these ideas away, and people are happy, because they love great ideas. I’ll give it to them and say, ‘Hey, it’s a great idea. You should do it.’ I’d try to give everything away first, and then I’d try to kill everything else. It’s the ones that keep coming back that I can’t kill and I can’t give away, that make me think, ‘Hmmm, maybe that’s the one I’m supposed to do.’ Success is you make your own slot. You have a new slot that didn’t exist before. Learn at a fairly young age the skill of being an ultra-thrifty, minimal kind of little wisp that’s traveling through time, in the sense of learning how little you actually need to live in a contented mode. That gives you the confidence to take a risk. People-pleasing is a form of assholery. If you had 8 weeks to get someone ready to do 5 minutes on stage at an open mic, what would you do? Get them on stage the first night [and] every night for all of the 8 weeks, whether they have material or not. The material is like 10% of it. Being comfortable on stage is all of it. So just get on stage. The first year and a half, two years of standup is just getting comfortable on stage. Your material doesn’t matter. If you think about something more than three times a week, you have to write about it. What pisses you off? Read Joseph Campbell-The Power of Myth and The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Joseph Campbell was the first person to really open my eyes to the compassionate side of life, or of thought. Campbell was the guy who really kind of put it all together for me, and not in a way I could put my finger on. It made you just glad to be alive, realizing how vast this world is, and how similar and how different we are. The more you know what you really want, and where you’re really going, the more what everybody else is doing starts to diminish. The clincher question Cal used to get free room and board around Europe as a poor traveler was: “Can you tell me: How do you make the perfect goulash?” A single question about goulash could get me 6 weeks of lodging and meals, and that’s how I got passed around the world. 10 years. The only way to use the inspiration of other artists is if you submerge yourself in the greatest works of all time, rather than listening to what’s on the radio now. Write about a time when you realized you were mistaken. Write about a lesson you learned the hard way. Write about a time you were inappropriately dressed for the occasion. Write about something you lost that you’ll never get back. Write about a time when you knew you’d done the right thing. Write about something you don’t remember. Write about your darkest teacher. Write about a memory of a physical injury. Write about when you knew it was over. Write about being loved. Write about what you were really thinking. Write about how you found your way back. Write about the kindness of strangers. Write about why you could not do it. Write about why you did. Goethe wrote this book by locking himself in a hotel room for 3 months, imagining his five best friends on different chairs, and then discussing with his imaginary friends different possibilities of plot. We don’t need in-person mentors as often as we think. Absolute favorite book of all time: Dropping Ashes on the Buddha by Zen Master Seung Sahn. High-agency person: When you’re told that something is impossible, does that start a second dialogue in your mind, how to get around whoever it is that’s just told you that you can’t do something? “The Martian” as “The ultimate high-agency film.” 10:10 looks like a smile to watch advertisers. It’s better to be in an expanding world and not quite in exactly the right field, than to be in a contracting world where peoples’ worst behavior comes out. Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. Try not to have more than one big desire in my life at any given time. All the real benefits in life come from compound interest. 99% of all effort is wasted. What’s the worst advice you hear often? “‘Write what you know.’ Why would I want to write about what little I know? Don’t I want to use writing to learn more?” Josh has no social media, does no interviews, and avoids nearly all meetings and phone calls. He minimizes input to maximize output. Josh says: “I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.” Learning the macro from the micro: This means focusing on something very small to internalize extremely powerful macro principles that apply everywhere. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. What’s the least crowded channel? People’s IQs seem to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them. Look at your to-do list and ask: “Which one of these, if done, would render all the rest either easier or completely irrelevant?” If you’ve got enough money to solve the problem, you don’t have the problem. Everyone else here is trying to get through that same door, and they’re not all going to fit. Not cheating. It’s just creative sportsmanship. Because I bent some rule in my favor. When something is wrong or going badly, just say, ‘Good.’","A very useful collection of notes from hundreds of hours of Tim's podcast interviews. It's definitely a mix of thoughts and advice from a mix of people. A real collage. The first quarter of the book, full of milligram measurements of things you could be ingesting, almost made me quit, but the 2nd half of the book had some great ideas."
The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need,Andrew Tobias,0544781937,4,"A penny saved - not spent - is two pennies earned. If you were planning to go out for dinner for around $50 but you ate at home instead for $10 . . . you’d have saved $40. To earn an extra $40, you’d actually have had to earn $80. Loans to Friends: “It is better to give than to lend, and it costs about the same.” Loans to Friends: A better solution may be to offer to guarantee a bank loan. You are still on the hook if your friend or relative defaults, but in the meantime the bank sends the nasty letters. What’s more, the fear of a bad credit rating might actually do more to get the loan repaid than the fear of losing your friendship. Sometimes, of course, the “loan” is quite intentionally just a face-saving way to help a friend too proud to ask for a gift but too poor to pay you back. Good for you for being such a nice guy. Consider putting 5% or 10% of your long-term funds in timber: The wise forest manager diversifies geographically and by species, so that the risks from fire and disease are mitigated. Timber should be a good inflation hedge. Properly managed, income from timber should be lightly taxed. Uncle Sam generally views the revenue not as a taxable dividend, but as a “return of capital.” Until you’ve sold off most of the trees you started with. At that point, you can sell your forest for a lightly taxed capital gain. Lock up a small fortune in a timber partnership. Don’t put more than 5% or 10% into timber. If you are in a terrible rush, convinced the stock is about to take off and there’s not a minute to lose, you are very likely reacting to some hot news. And believe me, unless you are trading (illegally) on inside information, chances are you are one of the last to hear this hot news. Nine times out of ten you will be buying your shares from someone who heard it first. What if you could invest in an index fund that somehow skipped all the worst businesses and concentrated instead on only the best? And not just the best, but those of the best that were selling cheapest relative to their bestness? Joel Greenblatt: The Little Book That Beats the Market. Visit magicformulainvesting.com to learn more. Consider one of Joel’s Gotham Funds. You can actually establish a valid living trust using Quicken Living Trust Maker. Life is not a business. Set yourself up comfortably and stop worrying. Unless you enjoy worrying about money and taking risks and paying taxes on profits and stewing over your losses, simply structure your assets so as to give you security and peace of mind. The “closed-end” fund: Such funds originally sold a set number of shares to the public, raising, say, $100 million to invest. Then they closed the doors to new money. Investors who wished to cash in their shares would sell them just as they would sell any regular stock, through a broker. Presumably, if the fund managers had turned the $100 million into $120 million, each share in the fund would be worth 20% more than it was at the outset. Or so everyone assumed. But things are only worth what people will pay for them, and shares in closed-end funds sank to discounts that ranged from a few percentage points up to 30% and more. (A few rose to premiums.) As I write this, for example, you can buy a dollar’s worth of assets in the Canadian World Fund for 70 cents. Or a dollar’s worth of assets in the RMR Asia Pacific Real Estate Fund for 80 cents. (Visit the Closed-End Fund Association [cefa.com] to see current data.) The discounts won’t do you much good if the managers of those funds have picked a dreadful assortment of stocks that all collapse - but it’s just about as hard to pick bad stocks as good, so that’s unlikely. More likely, you will have a dollar working for you even though you only had to pay 75 or 85 cents. The risk is that the discount, irrational to begin with, could widen still further by the time you went to sell your shares. On the other hand, the discount could narrow - which at least makes more sense, even if it’s not necessarily more likely to happen. There’s actually a sound reason for closed-ends to trade at a discount. They’re burdened by a handicap: namely, the 1% or more in management and administrative fees many subtract each year. If the stocks in the fund grew by 10% a year including dividends, the net asset value of the fund itself would grow at only 9%, after that 1%. (Of course, that’s true of open-end funds, too. Closed-ends offer two conceptual advantages over open-end funds. First, when trading at a substantial discount, a closed-end is like a less-than-no-load fund. You get $1 worth of assets working for you for 80 cents. Second, closed-end fund managers need not worry that, in a down market, they will be flooded with redemptions, forcing them to keep cash idle to redeem shares - or to dump holdings at what may be exactly the wrong time. So they may be able to do a better job managing the fund. Never buy a closed-end fund when it is first issued (because sales charges will be built into the price and it will likely fall to a discount). • Never buy a closed-end fund at a premium (because then you’re paying $1.05 or $1.30 to get $1 working for you). ETFs that index various parts of the bond market. The best broad index fund is the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND). The tide of falling interest rates has ebbed. So keep enough powder dry in banks or TIPS to endure what could be a nasty spill; and “average down” each time we have one. It’s just as easy to live well when you’re poor as when you’re rich - but when you’re poor, it’s much cheaper. Happiness lies less in how much you have than in which way you’re headed, which is a strong argument for saving something each year. Many small investors in the stock market, without knowing it, secretly want to lose. Feeling vaguely guilty. Guilty over “gambling” with the family’s money, guilty over trying to “get something for nothing,” or guilty over plunging in without really having done much research or analysis. Then they punish themselves, for these or other sins, by selling out, demoralized, at a loss. Instead of going to the store and laying out $10 for one bottle, you are laying out $108 for 12 bottles (full price minus the 10% discount). That extra $98 is your “investment.” By keeping at most $98 extra tied up all year, you save $1 a week on wine - $52 a year. And “earning” $52 a year by tying up $98 is earning 53%. If you were someone who planned to spend $10 a week on wine - $520 a year - and who would have LOVED to save 10% buying by the case but just couldn’t scrape up enough money all at once to do it, how much financing would you need? Would you have to go to a bank and ask for a $400 loan in order to change your buying habits? No, you would need only a $98 credit line - and you would only fully draw it down that very first week. After that, you would replenish it by $10 a week (the $10 you would otherwise have spent on wine by the bottle), which means that after 12 weeks, when you needed to buy the next case, you would not only have replenished the full $98, you’d actually have an extra $12 to work with (the money you saved buying by the case). So now you’d have to draw down only $86 of your $98 credit line. In other words, to finance this change in buying habits you’d need to borrow a maximum of $98.

Germany: Unraveling an Enigma,Greg Nees,1877864757,4,"The Germans are an enigma not only to the rest of the world but also to themselves. Discussing almost anything is one of the Germans’ favorite pastimes. Germans look to historical precedents in order to understand the present. Acceptance of the role of the guardian state and the consequent deemphasis on individual freedom. Sociologists critically examined the traditional German class structure. Having a rigid class structure and raising children to obey all authority were major factors in the Nazi takeover. Radical changes in educational structures and child-raising practices would be the best antidote to prevent a resurgence of fascism. Many of the Generation of ’68 chose to raise their children in what they claimed was an antiauthoritarian manner. Given the opportunity to grow up “freer” the two Germanys were formally reunited at midnight on October 2, 1990. Germany is a polycentric federation. Many of the current federal states are direct outgrowths of the former Germanic kingdoms and principalities. Unlike France, Spain, and Britain, with their historically centralized systems revolving around one major capital city, Germany exists as a series of smaller, interlinked centers, each of which had at one time been the capital of a smaller kingdom. There is no one megalopolis that completely dominates German politics, economy, and culture. Many citizens tend to place more importance on their regional than their national identity. “I am Bavarian first, European second, and German third.” Northern and eastern Germany are traditionally influenced by Protestant thought, while the south and west tend to be more Catholic. The Protestants tend to take a more serious view of life, whereas the Catholics view life more as a source of enjoyment. Rheinlanders are thought to talk more and are considered more cheerful and extroverted than the dour, serious, Protestant Swabians, who are famed for their thrift and industry. Bavarians are known for their Gemütlichkeit (sense of coziness, warmth, or intimacy) and open, friendly manner. People in the north talk faster, have fewer and shorter pauses in their speech, and are more emotionally reserved in personal relationships, warming up only slowly, and certainly not when they meet someone for the first time. For the northern German, the Bavarian’s switch to first names is far too impulsive, too intrusive, and quite impolite. Northerners are more cautious in their interactions, preferring to get to know one another well before moving to a first-name basis, if they do so at all. The Saxons are thought of as more lively, humorous, temperamental, and easygoing than their direct neighbors, the severe and serious Prussians. Values, norms, and beliefs, which interact in a complex way to influence all behavior and communication: will call these complex interactions “cultural themes,” because they run through a culture as a theme does through a book or a piece of music. Only when you understand the central cultural themes of any given culture can you accurately interpret and understand its inhabitants’ behavior, communication, and way of life. If you don’t understand their cultural themes, you will necessarily project your own values, norms, and beliefs onto them, and this projection is one of the principal causes of intercultural misunderstanding. If, however, you begin to learn the cultural themes, what before had seemed illogical or wrong behavior will take on a different meaning. Housing code goes into great detail about how a house may be designed, painted, and equipped. They see it as a way of ensuring a society that is concerned not only with individual rights but also with the common good. All of the houses are of a similar style and they present a pretty sight: roofs are covered with similar tiles and the colors harmonize. Unwritten codes of manners and customs also structure German social life. Germans are very protective of their homes and private lives. This sense of right and wrong is often expressed openly and emotionally by Germans, especially when they think someone has done something wrong. Gründlichkeit, or thoroughness: if they can’t do it thoroughly, they are inclined not to do it at all. Extremely high regard for rational, analytic thought. Strongly influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, with its emphasis on intellect, reason, and learning. The official German class system served as the prime creator of social Ordnung, structuring German social life until 1918. Three major classes: the aristocracy, the Bürgertum (professional and commercial middle class), and the lower class (workers and farmers)—lived in separate social worlds. Looking with disdain or envy upon members of the other classes. Interactions between members of different classes were marked by reserve and mistrust and were very formal in nature. While the class society was officially disbanded in 1918, its influence can still be found in German culture today. Acceptance of hierarchy, social roles, and the importance of social status. Germans distinguish clearly between insiders and outsiders on all levels. While many people from other ethnic groups have lived and worked in Germany for decades, the German government has done little to help them become citizens or to integrate them into German society. This often holds true even for their children, who were born and raised in Germany and who speak fluent German. On the other hand, persons from Eastern European countries claiming ethnic German status—even if only through a German great-grandfather—have been granted entry and have easily obtained German citizenship, although in many cases they could barely speak German. When you go into a German pub or restaurant, you can sit where you prefer. But you will generally find at least one table that is marked as the Stammtisch. If you try to sit at this table, even if no one else is sitting there, you will be politely informed that this is the Stammtisch, a special table reserved for regulars and that you must sit elsewhere. When Germans are in a group with which they identify and there are no outsiders present, they talk about being unter uns (among ourselves). Being unter uns creates a sense of security and solidarity. They open up and speak much more sincerely about topics they would never discuss with outsiders. Doors remain closed in most German public and office buildings. Sunday is considered a Ruhetag (day of rest), and any activity that makes noise or disturbs the peace, such as mowing the lawn, hammering, or playing loud music, is prohibited. Here, again, notice the German willingness to trade individual rights for social order. Germans think of a person with whom they work as a Kollege (colleague) and not as a friend. For this reason they typically address one another with the formal Sie, rather than du, which is reserved for friends and family. Strong distinction made between Freunde (friends) and Bekannte (acquaintances). A major distinction is the degree of commitment and obligation one has toward friends. Mentioning a worry or potential problem to a friend will elicit a series of concerned and detailed questions as well as sincere offers of help and support. Because of this sense of obligation that accompanies friendship, Germans limit the number of persons they consider Freunde. Their seeming aloofness: They probably already have enough friends and aren’t interested in extending their social network. For them the American desire to be popular and to keep as many friends as possible is confusing and seems superficial. Because Americans are far more mobile geographically and meet more new people when they move, they need to make friends quickly. This partly explains why many Americans tend to seek their friends among those with whom they work. Because Germans separate their private and public lives so clearly, they rarely seek out friendships among their coworkers, nor do they often socialize with them. It would be difficult to overestimate the German respect for understanding based on rational analysis and scientific knowledge. Germans love to converse at length, clear, well-thought-out, rational arguments based on broad knowledge elicit admiration and great respect. The symphony orchestra provides a useful metaphor: For the symphony orchestra to perform well, each individual must willingly submit to the whole in order that a greater good be reached. Egotistical grandstanding or poor playing by an individual musician can ruin the entire performance. Verbindlichkeit, which implies the binding nature of one’s word, duty and obligation. While still very young, Germans learn to be extremely careful about what they say because they are taught that when they speak, they are committing themselves to what they say. Communication Patterns: explicit verbal communication, which emphasizes the content and deemphasizes the relationship. To really express something exactly, one needs complicated language. This leads to a business German that is more elevated and convoluted as compared with the more pragmatic, popularistic American style. Direct attacks on the content of a person’s communication are common, but attacks on the person are avoided by keeping the discussion impersonal and objective. When German students turn sixteen, the law requires their teachers to address them with Sie. It has become common for younger Germans to address one another with du whenever they meet in a nonprofessional situation. The use of du or Sie is not simply a change of verbs and pronouns but rather a major change in modality. Americans put on a smile even when they are not feeling especially friendly, in part because their communication style emphasizes the relationship side of communication, encouraging them to be outgoing and personable. American: “Well, it doesn’t show him in a real positive light.” German: “Das war absolut unverschämt” (That was absolutely shameless). Calling someone “shameless” is quite common and comes from the more absolutist moral values typical of traditional German culture. A German would not think it odd to say “Das muß so sein” (It must be that way), where an American might express this opinion more diplomatically as “It would be good if we could do it that way.” “Bringen Sie uns zwei Rotwein, bitte” (Bring us two red wines, please), whereas an American might use a question format instead: “Could we have two glasses of red wine please?” These verbal habits can create the impression that Germans are not very concerned with the image they are creating. This is a false perception. Germans are very concerned about the image they present during a conversation, but the positive images they aspire to are somewhat different from those Americans try to create. In general, because of the strong public/private distinction, Germans strive for credibility and respect when speaking in the public sphere. At home and with friends, credibility is still important, but then likableness and affection play a much greater role. Diskussion is goal-oriented and therefore to be taken seriously. The goals of Diskussion can be to test one’s knowledge, discover the truth, or solve some problem. Mostly, Diskussion is analytical in nature and focuses on an issue that Germans consider a problem. Sachlichkeit means “objectivity,” but for Germans it means far more. It is really a mode or style of speaking and means sticking to the matter at hand, leaving out any personal references, and being as unemotional and matter-of-fact as possible. The idea of being sachlich pervades German speech, especially in the public sphere. Such “it” language gives educated German talk a sense of being highly impersonal, abstract, and objective, all of which make confrontations more formal and less likely to become overly heated. Think of their opinions as something distinct from their person. More comfortable with having their opinions attacked, without seeing it as an attack on their person. Americans tend to react personally when their opinions are attacked. Another aspect of remaining sachlich is keeping one’s personal stories and experiences out of the conversation as much as possible. Germans are encouraged to be modest and one exaggerated form of understatement is complaining. Ask a German businessman how his company is doing and you will often hear about the difficult problems the company is encountering. But you will often be surprised to see the company is well in the black. This type of complaining is simply the socially required “modesty” and “realism” that are expected. This is very different from the American corporate scene, where one is expected to present a positive image. In fact many Americans state they have no problems, only “challenges” and “issues.” Complaining is a social ritual and not a sign of despair. Through complaining together and about the same topics, the speakers are implicitly communicating that they belong to the same group and thus share a common view and common interests. The art of complaining is still highly valued. Sometimes distrust stems simply from the Americans’ lack of negativity, which the Germans see as unnatural. Immediate replies and “thinking out loud” are less frequent than in the United States and are interpreted as overly impulsive and lacking the appropriate seriousness. When Germans consider someone’s business success, one of their first questions is “At whose cost was that success achieved?” The assumption that all resources are limited and that if someone has managed to acquire more than his or her fair share, others will suffer as a consequence.","Written by an American who's lived in Germany for 20 years. Published in 2000, (and so probably written a couple years before), it's a little dated. The Berlin Wall was a fresh memory. So I'm assuming the current (for then) observations have changed a bit. But the historical perspective helped explain some core aspects to the culture."
Never Let Go,Dan John,1931046387,4,"One chooses Latin words to impress, not to communicate. People like to hear stories, usually about people. For years I have been preaching the following 3 points: 1. The Body is One Piece 2. There are three kinds of strength training: • Putting weight overhead • Picking it off the ground • Carrying it for time or distance 3. All training is complementary The secret to success is free will. Make yourself a slave to good habits. Consider training camp. I’m serious. Each year, I spend up to four weeks in training camps. Somebody wakes me up, somebody makes my meals, somebody else pushes me to work out, somebody else tells me when to put the lights out. You know, I work hard during those weeks. The single greatest value of a personal trainer is someone else’s will is replacing your will. How can I reinvent camp for my normal life? Save your precious free will by recruiting a vast army of people willing to give up their free will to bolster yours. How? Tell them, ask them, beg them for help. Bring everybody onboard to keep an eye on you. The more personal trainers, mentors, gurus, Yodas, and Gandalfs in your life, the better. Tell everyone you know your goals and watch how much easier it is to stay on track. Where else in your life does something become better and better and better every single time? If you bench press a hundred pounds and add ten pounds a month, you’ll bench 460 in about three years. Don’t let a great day destroy years of planning and training by thinking this is now the norm. Determine how many calories you need in a day. Consume that amount in at least five protein shakes made with added fiber every four hours. Take fish oil capsules. Once a week have a solid meal. That is it. You should take a walk every morning, and lift weights three days a week. The Velocity Diet took every ounce of free will I could muster. But, it worked. In fact, it worked so well, it stunned my doctor. “Tomorrow, I’ll break the diet and quit. Just not tonight.” I woke up, walked, drank my shake, and I was fine. You have to make deals with yourself all the time. Just one more hill, one more day, one more whatever. Veggies can be made to taste like candy just by not eating whole foods for twenty-eight days. Fat loss is an all-out war. Give it twenty-eight days — only twenty-eight days. Attack it with all you have. It’s not a lifestyle choice; it’s a battle. Lose fat, and then get back into moderation. Ab work won’t give you a six-pack. It will, however, be the best support work you can do for your entire training regimen. Instead of embarrassing yourself on a treadmill, burn fat using a barbell or dumbbell with either Tabata front squats or a HIIT version of farmer walks. The single finest training system I’ve ever used: It’s really hard, but really simple: One Lift a Day. Pick one lift each day and do it for the entire workout. Seven sets of five max squats followed by jumps seems to burn every fiber of the legs. Consider a weekly approach like this: Monday: Bench Press or Incline Bench Press Tuesday: Row or Row Variation Wednesday: Squat Thursday: Off Friday: Military Press Saturday: Curl, Deadlift, whatever The Tabata Method — Fat Loss in Four Minutes. What is it? Nothing to it: Take one exercise and perform it in the following manner. 1) For twenty seconds, do as many repetitions as possible. 2) Rest for ten seconds. 3) Repeat seven more times. That’s it! You’re done in four minutes! You need to choose an exercise that uses a large number of muscles. I suggest the front squat. Go light, like sixty-five to ninety-five pounds the first time. The thruster is one of the greatest lifts rarely seen in the gym. Take two dumbbells or kettlebells and hold them at shoulder height. Squat down, keeping the ’bells on the shoulders or the kettlebells in the rack position. As you rise up, press the ’bells to overhead lockout. You can either press as you rise, or use the momentum to help kick the bells overhead. A woman once asked me if I knew a diet where you could eat anything you wanted. I said yes, but first she’d have to eat two pounds of salmon, three cups of oatmeal, a cup of blueberries, two bowls of mixed vegetables, and a carton of cottage cheese. After she finished that each day, she could eat anything she wanted. The most unused concept in training: Be subtle. If healthy and fit, you should be able to do a double-bodyweight deadlift and a bodyweight bench press. If you can’t bench your bodyweight, don’t ask me about all the other stuff until you can. If you’re not yet at this level, you need to get there. The first standard workout I use is three days a week of lifting. One other day a week, I do a few hill sprints (very few) and on another day I do a fun activity like hike, bike or a team sport. The other standard workout I may do is the One Lift a Day Program. By choosing to train in a program that basically covers everything at a very-easy-to-moderate level, I’m pretty sure I’m ready for the experiment. The experiment? Yes, now I add the new groovy thing I learned. If, after two weeks, my knees hurt, deem this a failure. Add new lifts, variations, or ideas to your training program one at a time. I bought a set of chains a year ago and I only used them with front squats for the first month. The next month, after discovering how excellent these chains were for acceleration, I tried them with deadlifts. Now I use them for all squats, deadlifts and presses, but I might not have realized their benefit if I’d added a bunch of things at the same time. Some things only work for a short period of time. Eat three meals. Eat protein at every meal. Once you’re doing this consistently, try to add the magic food. When things go bad, simplify. For fat loss, he only recommended one thing. There was a flight of steps down on the beach, maybe 200 steps. He told me to sprint up to the top of them. “Try it. Then, after a couple of weeks, try to do it a couple of times.” Ever since that day, the first thing I look for is a hill or flight of stairs. I never failed to get at least one dad who’d tell me, “Yep, I was All-American in high school.” The mistake I made was never quitting sports. I can only be as good as the weight on the bar or what the tape measure tells me. I guess I can’t wait to quit just to discover how good I was. The single greatest error most lifting enthusiasts make, it would be this: They have no variety. Actively seek out new training concepts — not only to add variation, but also to challenge our long-held notions of strengths and weaknesses. A wonderful idea: Walk for a hundred meters and then do dips. After that, saunter over to do pull-ups, push-ups, bar jumps, squats and a host of other things. A great workout, a wonderful way to train, and probably one of the best ways to burn fat. Just by doing pull-ups, some kettlebells swings, some one-arm lifts, and some deadlifts you can get a fantastic workout. Litvinov, a five-foot, ten-inch, 196-pound hammer thrower, did the following training session. Eight reps of front squats with 405 pounds, immediately followed by a seventy-five-second 400-meter run. Repeat this little combination for a total of three times and go home. Sergey racked the bar and ran 400 meters... then did this two more times. The basic workout, The Litvinov. Perform any big lift and then drop the bar (gently) and run. Back squats don’t work because racking the weight and running away involve way too much care and planning. The best lifts are: Front Squat Overhead Squat (if you’re good at them) Snatch Swings with kettlebells The more intense you can train, the better. The challenge of sprinting seems to get the athlete to forget perfection and focus on completion. Pick a lift you know. Hit eight good reps with it, then sprint away for five seconds. Rest and repeat this two more times. • Next time you try the workout, try another lift and maybe go a bit longer on the sprint. • Do this easy progression about twice a week. If you choose to make this your whole leg workout, you’ve chosen wisely. As the weights go up in the lift and the sprint gets around ten to twenty seconds, try to zero in on three- to five-minute recoveries. The warm-up is the workout. If it is important, do it every day. If it’s not important, don’t do it at all. Each and every training session from now until you get twenty, do pull-ups. Yes, every workout. Just keep banging away day after day and soon the body is going to grant your wish. I think walking lunges are a disaster, but Bulgarian split squats are great? To quote The Man of La Mancha, “Come, enter into my imagination and see me as I truly am.” Coach said so. Said so is genius. It completely divorces you — and I mean completely — from any responsibility for your training. Why seven sets of four? Coach said so. Why fish oil? Coach said so. It’s an amazing moment of clarity; you can pawn off all your responsibility on someone else. It’s genius. Free up your brain to take care of what’s important. Just giving me the right to tell them what to do seems to free up new enthusiasm for training and the stuff they need to do in training. Denby spent a year doing something I wish I could do. He went back to his freshman year in college and retook the Humanities curriculum. In his mid-forties, he returned to Columbia College and sat in a room with a bunch of freshmen wearing backward baseball caps, and reread the great books. Great books change as you age. Health is the harmony of the organs to operate optimally. Fitness is task-based. If you want to know about fat loss or muscle building, ask top level bodybuilders. These guys know it. In other words, quit buying fat-loss devices off the late-night TV ads from former sitcom actors, quit buying fat-loss stuff Grandma tried after her cribbage partner heard about it, and quit trying fad diets. Instead, listen to the best of the best. Find people who are doing your task and follow them. Make sure your fitness approach matches your fitness goals. We should begin a list of Things I Tried and share the information. We could call it the internet. The Litvinov Workout Front Squat for 8 reps. Run 400 meters immediately after. Repeat three times. Taking a dumbbell or barbell, picking a big move, and doing it for as long as you can. How about ten minutes of jumping jacks? Front Squat for 8 reps Rest exactly ten seconds Front Squat for 8 reps Rest exactly ten seconds. For six weeks or so, everything works. Because everything works, research findings will always come to certain basic conclusions: Less food and more exercise is good for people who want to lose fat and training with resistance tends to make people stronger. When I was growing up, when you got hurt it was always your fault. There are basically nine different movements you should do as a human: • Vertical Push • Vertical Pull • Horizontal Push • Horizontal Pull • The Squatting Motion • The Posterior Chain (I call these deadlifts) • The Anterior Chain (sit-ups, leg raises) • The Twist or Torque Moves • The Total-body Explosion Exercises (If you’re limited by time, these are the ones to do.) Think about recovery. Here are the best and brightest. Bikram Yoga. the classes are ninety minutes long. If you decide to go twice a week, that’s three hours of stretching, pulling, twisting and relaxing. The intense heat — nearly always above 103 degrees and often around 110 — and the humidity does “something” for the body. The real reason I recommend Bikram Yoga. It’s the dialogue. On the top end of long-term recovery tools is the hot tub. I can extend a hot tub with stretching and a cold-water shower for up to thirty minutes. I wouldn’t jog for health, but playful runs are wonderful. Vary the speed and terrain and you have a really great activity that’s fun and healthful. Routinized jogging is factory work, not natural activity. If you log long miles on a track, I believe you’re compromising your health. For someone contemplating losing fat, I can’t imagine a more perfect week. Two days of locking down nutrition, two days of lifting, and a total of eight minutes getting the system to burn fat. Oh, and the other day? Have some fun. Life is more than all of this nonsense. I like really hard training, but you can’t do it every day. Instead of taking four years to drop fat, take twenty-eight days and do the Velocity Diet. Instead of taking four years to tweak your flexibility, go to a Bikram yoga studio and sign up for the thirty-day challenge. Let the coaching, the heat, and the yoga get you more flexible. Get as strong as you can the year before an Olympic year, then coast through the big year with that as your foundation. Instead of off-days or easy days, consider prep days when you take care of the other side of good training: your good nutrition. The Big Five most people recommend? • Squat • Deadlift • Good Morning • Bentover Row • Plank What’s that last one? Planks? Yes, planks. I hate planks. Why? Well, there you are shaking from stem to stern doing nothing but holding a position. These five lifts — the squat, the deadlift, the good morning, the bentover row and the plank. These five lifts will transform your body. The million-dollar key to learning movements in the gym: Let the body teach the body what to do. Listen to this: Try to stay out of it! Thinking through a movement often leads to problems. The single best lifting movement of all time: the goblet squat. Potato-sack squats and are a great reminder of how to deadlift. Do good mornings. First, stand up and place your hands in the V formed where your torso meets your legs. You know what I am talking about. Push your hands into the V and push your butt back as your hands disappear into the folds. That is the movement of a good morning. Yes, keep your head up, shoulder blades pinched back, and hold a big chest, but the movement is simply increasing the V. If you do it right — even with no weight — you will feel the hamstrings stretching. This is good. Stand with your back against the wall and push your butt back into the wall. Then, scoot out a few inches and push back again. Keep moving away until you literally can’t touch the wall any more. This is how to increase your life: That minute will feel like forever. Always choose intensity over volume. When in doubt, do fewer sets or fewer reps, but go heavier. Still unsure, go faster, not longer. Eat more protein. Eat more fiber. I know you think you do, but you don’t. Not long ago, I experimented with adding two additional daily low-carb protein shakes to my diet and, besides the fact my belt got too loose in a week, my energy and general level of happiness soared. I then started adding an orange-flavored no-sugar psyllium supplement to the protein and my blood profile improved at my next check-up. use the warm-ups to attempt to do every one of the big moves. The Big List 1. Horizontal Push (Bench Press, Push-up) 2. Horizontal Pull (Rows and variations) 3. Vertical Push (Military Press and variations) 4. Vertical Pull (Pull-up, Pulldown) 5. Explosive Full Body (Swings/snatches/cleans/jerks) 6. Quad-dominant Lower Body (Squat) 7. Posterior Chain (Deadlift) 8. Anterior Chain (Medicine Ball Ab Throw) 9. Rotational/Torque Every damn day! All nine movements are important, so we do them every single day. Do complexes to warm up. Here’s one of mine, only mildly stolen: Power Snatch for 8 reps Overhead Squat for 8 reps Back Squat for 8 reps Good Morning for 8 reps Row for 8 reps Deadlift for 8 reps Do these all in a row without letting go of the bar. Rest a minute, a minute-and-a-half, or two minutes, and do it again. Try three to five sets of this little complex. You’ve done 240 movements that cover practically all the other moves. Speed works in the weightroom. Going fast with weights makes you able to handle more weight. Do all my behaviors fit my goals? Nope. So, either I change my goals or change my behaviors. Either one will do. It’s like the advice Ben Franklin gave about becoming rich: Either increase the amount of money you take in or decrease the amount of money you spend. Either one will do, but both are better. Coaches and trainers like to see motivated clients. Here’s my idea of the perfect client: Julie is attending her high school reunion in twelve weeks. Julie is twenty pounds heavier than her cheerleading weight and asks you to help her lose it before the big day. If you say, “Hmmm, first let’s put you on a ten-week course of slowly building your ligaments and tendons up with some gentle movements to retrain the system,” she’ll be looking for a new trainer before you can further show your complete mastery of idiocy. No, what she wants to hear is, “Right, eggs only for four weeks, two gallons of water each day. We’ll hit the weightroom every morning and do sprint workouts at the track in the afternoons. I have some stuff banned by the FDA that might help, too.” Any form of hardcore, boot-campish death-march ideas will be fine. Stick moderation on the shelf for a while. Three degrees of goal-setting that break down very easily into three terms: Should, Could, Must There’s certainly a value to each level, but success in life and lifting only occurs during the must phase. To be truly great, you’ve got to make your goals musts. The more choices you have, the higher your chance of becoming depressed. == Relax into Stretch: Instant Flexibility Through Mastering Muscle Tension by Pavel Tsatsouline. The section on the reminiscence effect, that wonderful gift from the Cosmos that makes us better when we quit or take time off, is worth the price of the book alone.",Some thoughts and advice on weight lifting and strength training.
In Pursuit of Silence,George Prochnik,0767931211,4,"while he floats on his back in the bath, I have him name all the different sounds he can hear at a given moment, from water burbling in the pipes, to the electricity zizzing behind the lights, to a cat thumping off the couch below, to the skirmishing of squirrels on a heavy branch outside. Silence is the shared ground between religions. Sound imposes a narrative on you, and it’s always someone else’s narrative. Silence is not a function of what we think of as silence. It’s when my reaction is quiet. What’s silent is my protest against the way things are. The argument for quiet may be what otherwise remains in danger of going unheard. Monks live in the desert. We come for a radical confrontation with ourselves. Silence is for bumping into yourself. That’s why people can’t get into a car without turning the radio on. They seek to avoid that confrontation. The hunger for silence is hunger for the thing that silence facilitates or acts as a catalyst of, rather than for the silence itself. Teachers can walk into a room full of chaos and be as kind and gathered as though they’re with a baby. Meditation enhances the ability to make discriminations between important and unimportant stimuli. This translates into a reduction in overall brain activity. You want to see impulses travel more quickly through certain more limited numbers of synapses to make the whole thing more effective. The main highway to frivolity: chatter. Allow the silence to be heard for what it really was: a solvent which destroys personality and gives us leave to be great and universal. Without silence people had no ability to understand one another. Stop allowing any difficult decisions to be made by discussion. The noise makes the decision. We have six free hours before our workday begins. How many rich people can say that? We call it ‘holy leisure.’ Having that time does something to your humanity. fMRI studies of people listening to music: the peak of positive brain activity actually occurs in the silent pauses between sounds, when the brain is striving to anticipate what the next note will be. You hear a snap off in the distance, what do you do? You look for it! The ears are animal detectors and they tell your eyes where to go. What is it about the sense of hearing that makes the idea of having nothing to hear so appealing? Most animals don’t announce their presence if they can help it. Animals move through space as quietly as possible. Today people make noise to reassert their importance, but for our predecessors silence was almost always the secret to survival. Everman read Benvenuto Cellini’s autobiography, and resolved to make a project of developing the artist, warrior, and philosopher facets of his personality, in accordance with the Renaissance ideal. Pythagoras compared the entire universe to a musical instrument that brought dissonant elements into harmony. Each planet, Pythagoras believed, produces a note in the course of its orbit. Noise has more frequencies than musical sound and the frequencies are not related. A thundering growl is as much a signal to us that we better hide as it was to our ancestors. The problem with alarming sounds is that while we are quite good at psychologically adjusting, if we hear them often enough, our physiologies never habituate. No matter how thoroughly our conscious minds might know that a loud siren rushing by is not coming for us, our blood pressure still spikes, our pupils still dilate, and our hair cells still flatten and twist. The word “noise” derives from nausea. Noise-canceling headphones: Active noise control actually involves making more sound so that we hear less noise. At midnight on January 2, 1950, a series of extraordinary, spontaneous protests brought to an end a 13-week program in which canned music, along with 240 commercials per 17-hour period, were broadcast through 82 loudspeakers positioned throughout Grand Central Station. But the commuters rose up, insisting on their inalienable right not to be exploited as “captive audiences,” demanding their “right not to listen.” They made dire prophecies that if this practice were tolerated, the trains themselves would be next. The basic strategy for locating the remaining sites of silence: All the places people are naturally drawn to for work, recreation, and shopping are going to be impossibly loud. But a short distance inland cuts the crowds down to a dribble of locals and suddenly one finds oneself in an authentically foreign place. Underneath bridges, tops of undistinguished skyscrapers, historical societies and libraries, museums of unfashionable subjects, cemeteries on weekdays. Where’s the culture pulling everyone? Now turn around and walk the other way. Keep walking. Theodor Lessing’s idea that when people feel caged up, they get loud. From the early 1980s to 2003, driving delays in twenty-six major American cities surged by an astounding 655 percent. Green Glue is probably the top-selling soundproofing product in the world today.",Interesting thoughts and findings on the search for peace and quiet in the modern world.
The Laws of Subtraction,Matthew May,0071795618,4,"Poet Fujiwara no Teika: “The poet who has begun a thought must be able to end it so masterfully that a rich space of suggestions unfolds in the imagination of his audience.” Work is fun and productive when we’re doing what we do best while those around us are doing what they do best. It’s not so much fun when we’re doing work that others are better at but aren’t doing because we’ve failed to design the work properly. If we are wise enough to contemplate our own experiences, we can figure out the square root - what’s at the core - so that we can be not only wise but also heroic in using wisdom to take the right action to make fundamental changes. Having just one bad apple in a small group can drag down performance by up to 40 percent. Smaller teams are more effective than larger teams because as group size grows, more attention is devoted to running the group and less to the task at hand. Vacation policy employed by Netflix, the streaming video and DVD-by-mail company based in Silicon Valley, is audaciously simple and simply audacious. Salaried employees can take as much time off as they’d like, whenever they want to take it. Nobody - not employees themselves, not managers - tracks vacation days. In other words, Netflix’s holiday policy is to have no policy at all. Since Netflix wasn’t tracking how many hours people were logging each work day, these employees wondered, why should it track how many holidays people were taking each work year? Rules and policies and regulations and stipulations are innovation killers. People do their best work when they’re unencumbered. Lao Tzu wrote: “A leader is best when people barely know he exists; when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.” Read John Maeda’s book [The Laws of Simplicity]. It’s short and appears not to have much information. It appears simple, but it’s an incredibly complex book. Subtract the obvious, add the meaningful. Subtraction can mean the difference between a highly persuasive presentation and a long, convoluted, and confusing one. In my own experience I’ve noticed that speakers who deliver presentations with fewer words carry themselves better. They have leadership presence. They’ve internalized the story and are confident about their message. People who fill their slides with words and bullet points are often unsure of the material and speak with less passion and conviction.","I'm biased. I'm in it. This is a subject I live. So I flipped through a little fast, thinking, “Yep. I know. Got it. Living it. Yep.” But for those who need some minimalist inspiration, this has some great thoughts in it."
Drop Dead Healthy,A. J. Jacobs,141659907X,4,"Egonomics is a theory by a Nobel Prize-winning economist named Thomas Schelling. Schelling proposes that we essentially have two selves. Those two selves are often at odds. There’s the present self, that wants that frosted apple strudel Pop-Tart. And the future self, that regrets eating that frosted apple strudel Pop-Tart. The key to making healthy decisions is to respect your future self. Honor him or her. Treat him or her like you would treat a friend or a loved one. HourFace digitally ages your photo. I did it with a picture of myself. When I’m wavering about whether to lace up my running sneakers or not, I’ll catch sight of Old A.J. Respect your elder, as disturbing-looking as he may be. This workout is for him. Of all the gadgets that clutter my closet, the most successful has been one of the simplest: a twenty-dollar pedometer. Studies show that the more you pay attention to your body’s statistics, the greater the chance you’ll adopt a healthy lifestyle. This idea underpins the Quantified Self movement. The mere act of weighing yourself daily makes it more likely you’ll shed pounds. Keeping a food journal makes you eat fewer fatty foods. The humble lobster may hold some clues to immortality, since aging doesn’t inflict damage on lobster cells. If not for outside forces like disease and predators, the average lobster might just keep on crawling along the bottom of the ocean for centuries. Placebo comes from “I shall please” in Latin “Just do it!” (the advertising copywriter got the idea for the phrase from the last words of executed murderer Gary Gilmore. So I can’t say it without thinking of a firing squad.) Without some delusional optimism, you’ll suffer from Depressive Realism. This psychological theory holds that the people with the most accurate view of the world aren’t happier - they’re clinically depressed. Studies show they have a correct perception of how much they control the outcome of events - namely, very little - and it crushes them. If you’re too delusionally optimistic, you’ll be unbearable. You’ll refuse to save money or make backup plans. You’ll invade foreign countries and expect to be greeted as liberators. Like so much else in the body, stress started out as a helpful ally back in Paleo times. There’s a law in New York that adults are forbidden to enter a playground unless they’re accompanied by a child. A grown man can’t just walk in by himself and loiter around the monkey bars. Whenever I come to a hard problem, I do jumping jacks to try to dislodge the solution from my brain. Why the obsession with toxins? It probably comes from our primitive caveman minds. We divide everything into either food or poison. Land lightly on the front of the foot and let the heels just kiss the ground. Take small steps.

Unless you have a skin problem, one moisturizer is almost as good as any other. Wrinkle-preventing options, just a few actually work. The most established: tretinoin, known more widely as Retin-A. This acid helps the skin retain collagen, the elastic material. It might even have health benefits in addition to the cosmetic ones. According to The New York Times, it’s been used to treat precancerous skin cells. Studies show that after two years of use, abnormal cells returned to normal. At my request, my dermatologist prescribed me a tube of Retin-A. It’s absurdly expensive. Retin-A has other downsides. It makes skin more likely to get sunburned as it allows in more UV light. A problem infecting all medicine: the specialty bias. Most experts see the world through the prism of their specialty. Most health advice can be summed up in five words: Eat less, move more, relax. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT). Instead of jogging at 60 percent of your ability for forty-five minutes, you go at 100 percent for a mere thirty seconds. Then you stop and rest for a minute. Then sprint again. Then repeat eight times. The benefits are many: raised endurance, lower blood sugar, improved lung capacity, and weight loss. HIIT seems to alter the metabolism and muscle structure, so you burn more calories throughout the day. Dolphins sleep one half brain at a time. Try counting backward by three. I did. And in just a few seconds (400, 397, 394 . . .), I felt a gear in my brain click to neutral.

Little Bets,Peter Sims,1439170428,4,"Chris Rock: He watches the audience intently, noticing heads nodding, shifting body language, or attentive pauses, all clues as to where good ideas might reside. Ingenious ideas almost never spring into people’s minds fully formed; they emerge through a rigorous experimental discovery process. Amazon’s strategy of developing ideas in new markets to “planting seeds” or “going down blind alleys.” They learn and uncover opportunities as they go. Many efforts turn out to be dead ends, Bezos has said, “But every once in a while, you go down an alley and it opens up into this huge, broad avenue.” Like Chris Rock, Bezos has accepted uncertainty; he knows that he cannot reliably predict which ideas for new markets will work and which won’t. He’s got to experiment. People who approach problems in a nonlinear manner using little bets. Experimental innovators. Little bets are concrete actions taken to discover, test, and develop ideas that are achievable and affordable. They begin as creative possibilities that get iterated and refined over time. When we can’t know what’s going to happen, little bets help us learn about the factors that can’t be understood beforehand. Fascinating research by Saras Sarasvathy, titled “What Makes Entrepreneurs Entrepreneurial.” Design thinking provides a set of creative methodologies for solving problems and generating ideas that is based on building up solutions, rather than starting with the answer. Fundamental to the little bets approach is that we: • EXPERIMENT: Learn by doing. Fail quickly to learn fast. Develop experiments and prototypes to gather insights, identify problems, and build up to creative ideas, like Beethoven did in order to discover new musical styles and forms. • PLAY: A playful, improvisational, and humorous atmosphere quiets our inhibitions when ideas are incubating or newly hatched, and prevents creative ideas from being snuffed out or prematurely judged. • IMMERSE: Take time to get out into the world to gather fresh ideas and insights, in order to understand deeper human motivations and desires, and absorb how things work from the ground up. • DEFINE: Use insights gathered throughout the process to define specific problems and needs before solving them, just as the Google founders did when they realized that their library search algorithm could address a much larger problem. • REORIENT: Be flexible in pursuit of larger goals and aspirations, making good use of small wins to make necessary pivots and chart the course to completion. • ITERATE: Repeat, refine, and test frequently armed with better insights, information, and assumptions as time goes on. HP got most of its ideas for new products by informally observing or talking with customers to identify problems and needs. You have to catch people making mistakes and make it so that it’s cool. You have to make it undesirable to play it safe. Failure, in the form of making mistakes or errors, and being imperfect is essential to their success. It’s not that they intentionally try to fail, but rather that they know that they will make important discoveries by being willing to be imperfect, especially at the initial stages of developing their ideas. An essential part of the Silicon Valley ethos is that the culture there embraces a willingness to fail in order to learn what to do. Success hides problems. Constantly identify and solve new problems. He talks about the problems that Pixar has encountered and the mistakes that he has made. Healthy insecurity is the same phrase Gehry uses to describe how he feels when he begins each new project. “I’m always scared that I’m not going to know what to do,” Gehry says. “It’s a terrifying moment. And then when I start, I’m always amazed: ‘Oh, that wasn’t so bad.’” Characteristics of what psychologists view as healthy perfectionism include striving for excellence and holding others to similar standards, planning ahead, and strong organizational skills. Healthy perfectionism is internally driven in the sense that it’s motivated by strong personal values for things like quality and excellence. Conversely, unhealthy perfectionism is externally driven. External concerns show up over perceived parental pressures, needing approval, a tendency to ruminate over past performances, or an intense worry about making mistakes. Healthy perfectionists exhibit a low concern for these outside factors. Be wrong as fast as we can. We’re gonna screw up, let’s just admit that. Let’s not be afraid of that. But let’s do it as fast as we can so we can get to the answer. Write really, really shitty first drafts. This is how they end up with good second drafts and terrific third drafts. “Let’s look at it for a while,” Gehry says, “and be irritated by it.” Prototyping can be somewhat counterintuitive, placing the emphasis on doing to be able to think rather than thinking in order to do. We are more likely to experience flow when we do work that appeals to our intrinsic interests that’s also aligned with our personal strengths. When software teams worked on longer-term projects, they were inefficient and took unnecessary paths. However, when job tasks were broken down into particular problems to be solved, which were manageable and could be tackled within one or two weeks, developers were more creative and effective. The practice of smallifying problems. Steve Jobs is known to say, “People don’t know what they want if they haven’t seen it.” One of the great benefits of the agile approach is that it is also a good method for failing fast. If you can launch ten features in the same time it takes a competitor to launch one, you’ll have ten times the amount of experience to draw from in figuring out what has failed the test of customer acceptance and what has succeeded. Questions are the new answers Ahe worm’s-eye view: “When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a bird’s-eye view, you tend to become arrogant— you do not realize that things get blurred when seen from an enormous distance.” Get out into the world to challenge their own assumptions, says, “No facts exist inside the building, only opinions.” Steve Jobs: “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people … Unfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective.” The observational methods of anthropology are infiltrating the corporate world. People too often have a tendency to think that certain people, experts or mentors for example, have all the answers when in reality insight is far more dispersed. Lucky people pay more attention to what’s going on around them than unlucky people. Lucky people tend to be open to opportunities (or insights) that come along spontaneously, whereas unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine, fixated on certain specific outcomes. At social parties, for example, unlucky people tended to talk with the same types of people, people who are like themselves. It’s a common phenomenon. On the other hand, lucky people tended to be curious and open to what can come along from chance interactions. Lucky people are effective at building secure, and longlasting, attachments with the people they meet. They are easy to know and most people like them. They tend to be trusting and form close relationships with others. As a result, they often keep in touch with a much larger number of friends and colleagues than unlucky people. And time and again, this network of friends helps promote opportunity in their lives. Lucky people increase their odds of chance encounters or experiences by interacting with a large number of people. (Business school?) : What you know, they’ll never know, and what they know, you can learn. Extreme users, whose unique needs can foreshadow the needs of other people. The reason why designers find extreme users so valuable is because the average person isn’t actively thinking about solving problems like these. Their needs and desires are less pronounced. Choose a few consumers that you really feel are the early adopters, test it with them, see what they like about it and what they don’t like about it … And, if it appeals to them, use them to optimize it [the idea] further and then the laggards will follow. Active users are rare, but they sit at the top of pyramids of other people who are working to solve similar problems. Schultz believed they should just say yes to customer requests. So, for example, Schultz was initially determined to avoid using nonfat milk since he didn’t think it tasted as good as regular milk and because it was at odds with the Italian coffee experience. When customers kept requesting nonfat drinks, Schultz relented. The success of those drinks became an important small win and soon much more: nonfat milk would grow to account for almost half of Starbucks’s lattes and cappuccinos.","Examples of the fact that much success or creativity comes from trying many things, failing fast, getting feedback, trying more things, and deliberate practice.

One Simple Idea,Stephen Key,0071756159,4,"It is often much faster and more economical for a company to bring to market a licensed product based on a simple idea - an improvement or enhancement to an existing product - than it is to start at square one in R&D and go through the whole long, complicated, and expensive process of coming up with and developing an idea themselves. So licensing our ideas is really just good business for companies. It reduces their R&D costs. It accelerates their product development time. And it creates a multiplying effect: essentially getting other people to develop ideas for them for free. This concept of companies licensing ideas from outside their own walls is known as open innovation. Intellectual property is the legal ownership, by a company or individual, of an intangible asset, a creation of the mind - an idea. Intellectual property encompasses many types of intangible assets, including musical, literary, and other artistic works; ideas, discoveries, and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs. A simple improvement or a small incremental change to an existing product is often the easiest, fastest, most cost-effective, and most profitable way for companies to bring a new product to market. It’s hard for them to think outside the box or even right beside the box, which is where many of the most doable and profitable ideas are situated. A midsize company is usually the ideal candidate to license your idea. They are most likely to view the licensing of an idea as an opportunity to become number two or three in the market. When a big corporation is interested in an idea created by an independent product developer or a design firm, they typically want to purchase the idea (patents) outright. Find the number three or number four player in the market and show them how licensing your idea can make them number two or even number one. When consumers want something, they want it now, not years from now. Consumers in the commercial, government, and scientific sectors are no more patient. Open innovation - licensing ideas from the outside - enables them to be first to market and to fill their shelf space with products consumers want. Find the answers to these six critical questions: 1. Who are my competitors? Identify both the major players and the smaller players. 2. How does my idea compare and contrast with other products in the market? 3. What value does it offer that the other products do not? 4. How large is the market? 5. Who are my primary customers? 6. What are my potential sales? Building and testing a prototype and filing a patent. Know the basics of manufacturing the product, so that you can speak intelligently about it to potential licensees. File a provisional patent application. It will give you patent pending for one year without huge expenditures. I can develop a product for licensing in less than 30 days and for under $500 - which I had already done successfully 20 times. Most people innovate backward. They develop a product to solve a problem that bothers them personally without first confirming that it bothers the market universally. Instead of creating a new market for your idea, create an idea for an existing market. It’s one thing to create a product you like. It’s quite another to design a product that consumers like and will buy. I just went to Toys “R” Us and walked the aisles. I looked at what was on the shelves and tried to imagine ways to make a small change that would have a big impact. My shopping excursions only planted the seed of an idea. I had to do more market research to germinate that idea: to figure out how to design it, how much it should cost, who might license it, and so on. Discover hot markets and emerging trends. Check out websites such as Trendsetter.com and MindBranch.com Look at new products, and ask store managers which items are hot. There are usually three or four big companies that produce most of the products in a given market. Review their product pages or online catalogs. Go to their media page and read any new product releases. Innovation through observation is observing how people use products at home, at work, or at play to identify their wants, needs, and desires. Update or spruce up something that has been around, relatively unchanged, for a long time. Paul came up with ideas by looking at how kids play traditional childhood games and then updating them. One day he decided to take a look at a game kids have been playing forever: tag. “What can we do to update tag?” he asked himself and his team of engineers. “Is there any technology we can apply to tag?” Sure enough, they came up with Lazer Tag, using infrared technology. I went into the Disney store at my local mall and asked the manager what their most popular product was. He said it was their cups. I saw that some of the plastic cups had a double-layer outer wall. The back layer was a color (red, blue, yellow, etc.), the front layer was clear plastic, and there were sparkles between the two layers. I immediately thought of other images and games you could put between the two layers of plastic, which kids could play by rotating the cup. I looked on the bottom of the cups in the Disney store and saw the manufacturer’s name, Trudeau. They licensed the idea from me, and for five years my rotating character cups were sold in every Disney store and theme park worldwide. “What if a combination lock had letters, instead of numbers, so you could spell out your secret code?” He now has a successful product, Wordlock, which is sold in tens of thousands of stores around the world. Many companies don’t know how or don’t have a system in place to go find those ideas. Likewise, many independent product developers don’t know how to license their ideas, and some simply prefer hiring someone to “rep” their ideas to licensees for them. This scenario creates a huge opportunity for you to profit from connecting innovators with manufacturers. As a product scout, you find great ideas and then find the right companies to license them. In return for your services, the product designer splits the licensing royalty with you. Five simple strategies to product-scouting success: 1. Become a licensing expert. 2. Find your niche. 3. Study the market. 4. Focus on ideas you can sell. 5. Cut a win-win agreement. Become a licensing expert: a master at finding marketable ideas and getting them into the marketplace. At inventRight we offer courses with CDs and workbooks as well as online classes and other tools for learning how to find, develop, and license great ideas. Another great resource is Ideapow: an “online learning lab” for “entrepreneurial-minded people” who want to learn how to license ideas. Take the rifle approach and focus on an industry you’re familiar with. Stay plugged into new and emerging trends. Many designers think they can simply list their ideas on a website and it will somehow sell itself. Companies simply do not search these sites for ideas. But you can, and you know how to evaluate an idea. These designers are likely to be desperate for some help licensing their ideas. Try typing these keywords into your browser and then bookmark any sites that you like: • “Invention for sale” or “inventions for sale” • “Patent for sale” or “patents for sale” • “Invention listing sites” Visit inventor forums. Do an Internet search for “inventors forums” or “inventors discussion groups” to find forums where you can go check out what’s on the minds and drawing boards of designers. Mine the talent at art and design schools Publicize constantly. It’s not about how big or small, how complex or simple, or how unique or clever your idea is. It’s about which idea is going to take the least amount of work and has the highest probability of success. Whenever I come up with an idea I’m interested in, I give it this four-step litmus test to see if it’s a potential winner worth pursuing further: 1. Does it solve a common problem? 2. Does it have a wow factor? 3. Does it have a large market? 4. Does it use common production methods and materials? Companies don’t want to educate the market about a product or create a new market for a product. They’re like me: they like ideas that are simple to explain and easy to show its unique value. They want ideas that consumers will take one look at and say, “I get it. I love it! I see how it benefits me. I want it.” Whatever you do in life, find someone who has already done it, get as close as you can, and learn as much as you can. Sometimes, because you’re not an expert in a field, you can look at things differently and see simple ideas with mega marketing potential that the “experts” might overlook. But once you get an idea that fires you up, you need to gain some expertise in that field so you can make good decisions about whether and how to move forward with it. The only opinions that really matter are the opinions of potential licensees. Companies are only interested in licensing ideas they can: • Put on their existing production lines quickly and easily, with little or no modification to their manufacturing processes • Distribute through existing channels in which they already operate or that are closely related to the channels in which they operate • Produce at a cost and sell at a price that is profitable Call the manufacturer and ask for someone in sales. I would say something like, “I’m Stephen Key with Stephen Key Design. I’m working on a special project for a client, and I’d like to send over some drawings and get a price quote.” The sales rep is going to fall all over him- or herself trying to help you and supply you with what you need. Just make sure to send over a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), and make sure you’ve already filed a provisional patent application on your idea. Send over a drawing, and I make sure to include “Patent Pending” on the drawing so they know some intellectual property protection has been filed. Ask for a price quote on 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 units. The sales rep will go to work for you and come back with a price quote and all this other information to help you because the sales rep wants to get an order! It’s brilliant. Occasionally, I will call contract manufacturers and ask to speak to engineers. If I ask a few basic manufacturing questions and don’t ask them to divulge any trade secrets, they’re usually very helpful. Sometimes, you can’t get them to shut up, because they’re so happy to have someone interested in what they’re doing. If the sales rep or the engineer tells you that the company can’t manufacture your idea, ask him or her why. This way you can understand the manufacturing process, then redesign if necessary. Online encyclopedia HSIM http://howstuffismade.org Far too many inventors and independent product developers overlook this step. They design with no knowledge of, and with no regard to, manufacturing. Only in the United States, patent protection is granted to the “first to invent,” meaning the first who conceived of and practiced the invention. In almost all other countries, entitlement to a patent is established by the “first to file,” which is awarded based on the date of the application, regardless of the date of the actual invention. “Provisional” patent applications allow an inventor to obtain a priority date and a patent pending number, which is valid for one year. A final or complete nonprovisional application must then be filed before the 12-month anniversary of the provisional patent application or the original date will be lost. Further, in most countries a mutual nondisclosure agreement (NDA) signed by both the inventor and someone with whom the inventor wishes to show or discuss his idea can protect the confidentiality of an invention prior to submitting either a provisional patent application or regular nonprovisional patent application. This is a must in countries where it is first to file. The number one rule of this game is first to market wins. So if you don’t get your idea to market quickly, someone else probably will. Protect your intellectual property while getting your idea to market. It’s called a provisional patent application (PPA). Recommend David Pressman’s books Patent It Yourself and Patent Pending in 24 Hours. A new method of doing business or a new manufacturing process (utility patent). • A useful apparatus, machine, manufactured item, or composition of matter (utility patent). The ideas of most entrepreneurs, independent product developers, and small businesses fall under this category. • Computer programs and mathematical algorithms used in computer programs (utility patent). A provisional patent application (PPA) is a relatively new device that the USPTO began offering in 1995. It is a straightforward application that uses text and drawings to specify how to make and use an idea. PPAs apply only to ideas that fall under the utility patent category. A provisional patent is in force for a period of 12 months, after which you can either file a regular nonprovisional patent application or let it expire. • You can include a “Patent Pending” notice on documents, drawings, sell sheets, and prototypes you present to potential licensees. • As long as the patent is pending, no potential competitor can access your patent application to rip off your idea. In fact, the USPTO won’t even read your provisional patent application until and unless you either file a regular patent application or someone disputes your rights to the idea. You can write your own PPA, but I recommend using the PatentWizard software (http://www.patentwizard.com) from Neustel Law. Start an “inventor’s logbook” and keep it updated. An accurate and detailed logbook is your first line of defense in protecting your idea. Under U.S. patent law, intellectual property ownership is based upon “first to invent,” not first to file a patent. So it is extremely important that you document your idea from the moment you conceive of it, through each design change, and all the way to its final design, licensing, and manufacture. An NDA is necessary whenever you show your idea to anyone other than your immediate family and most trusted friends. It’s important to include a provision in the contract that limits the scope of the NDA to information that is known to be confidential. A good NDA will contain these key provisions: 1. The parties agree not to disclose each other’s confidential information to others. 2. The parties agree not to use each other’s confidential information without compensating the other party. 3. The parties agree to return all documents, information, and prototypes supplied by the other in the event no agreement is reached with regard to the idea. 4. The parties agree that information that is already known to the receiving party or that is known and used by others is not deemed confidential. Very few, if any, companies and investors go searching the Internet and “tweeting” for ideas to license or fund. Nor do they routinely (if ever) scout social media or any other media for ideas to bring to market. Nor do they frequent (if they visit at all) inventor and product developer forums in search of the next big idea, which in reality is usually a simple idea with big market potential. These services and media channels may serve a good purpose, but it is not to bring a licensee to your door, despite innumerable claims to the contrary. It is far more effective to go out there and find a licensee for your idea. Doing your homework to identify and qualify potential licensees To successfully bring an idea to market, you must control every step of the process - from developing your idea to protecting and licensing it. Throughout the process, you must also control who knows about your idea, what they know about it, how you tell them about it, and when. So protect your idea with a PPA and an NDA before showing it to anybody.",Good introduction into the world of licensing your ideas to companies that manufacture products.
Focus,Leo Babauta,1434103072,4,"Addictive activities, such as doing drugs or eating junk food, have the same kind of instant positive feedback -- you do the activity, and right away, you're rewarded with something pleasurable but don't feel the negative consequences until much later. Checking email, or any similar online activity, has that addictive quality of instant positive feedback and delayed negative feedback. I wasn't living up to the expectation of society that I'd be available via email and at least make the attempt to reply. Creating is a completely separate process from consuming and communicating. All the reading and consumption of information we do, all the communicating we do, and all the switching between modes we do -- it all takes away from the time we have to create. Separate your day: a time for creating, and a time for consuming and communicating. And never the twain shall meet. When you're meeting with someone, turn off the device so you can focus on that person completely. Try changing each trigger, one at a time. So if you go to check your blogs first thing in the morning, make it a new habit to not open your browser, and instead open a simple text editor and start writing. Start your day in quiet, before the busy-ness of the world intrudes on your peace of mind. Begin your work day by listing your three Most Important Tasks. Start immediately on the top task. Single-task on this important task as long as you can -- ideally until it's done. Now you've started your day with focus, and you've already accomplished something great. Every hour or two, do a refocus ritual. 25 minutes of focus + 5 minutes of rest. Work disconnected for 45 minutes and connect for 15 minutes. You get the idea -- it's almost as if the connected period is a reward for doing good, focused work. Limit your stream to only the most essential information and communications, and you'll free up hours of time for creating and doing amazing things. Start from scratch. Assume that nothing is sacred, empty your plate, and only put back on it what you absolutely need or love. Admit to yourself: you can't read and consume everything. You can't do everything, Choose what you'll do and read and respond to, and let the rest go. Let the rest go. This is unbelievably important. You have to accept this, and be OK with it. Are you afraid people will think you're rude? Are you afraid you'll miss something? Are you afraid you'll lose customers? This obsession with keeping up with information takes away from the things that are most important to us. But we try to keep up because we're afraid: we might miss something important, and seem ignorant we might miss out on an opportunity we might not see something bad that we need to respond to. Remember that urges are only temporary. If you are aware that you're feeling an urge, you can ride it like a wave -- it'll surge and get stronger, and then fade away. Take some deep breaths, and replace the habit with another habit. Whenever you find yourself dreading something, procrastinating, forcing yourself and hating it, stop and ask yourself why. There must be a reason -- you'll never sustain any action for long if you hate doing it. Change course to something you're more excited about, Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy. Another famous quote by Lao Tzu, it's timeless and wise. If you can manage the easy, small things now, you'll save yourself the time and effort of having to do the difficult things later. While many people will say that striving for something new is a good thing, that we should always be striving, unfortunately it means we're never satisfied. Charles Dickens once wrote, ""He did each single thing as if he did nothing else."" Your Most Important Task list. These should be extremely important tasks that will have a high-impact on your life. Don't do anything else before doing the first thing on this short list. Multi-projecting can work -- you get one project going, but while you're waiting on something, you can switch to a second or even third project. All the time, you're only working on one task at a time, until each task is done, however. Do note that there's a danger in taking on too many projects at once. I'd suggest taking on as few projects as possible. If you can do only one project at a time, without getting stuck in waiting, then do that -- it's much more effective and you'll get your projects done much faster. But when you must wait, you can switch to a second project. The best art is created in solitude, for good reason: it's only when we are alone that we can reach into ourselves and find truth, beauty, soul. ""Just in case"" is a place in the space time continuum that invokes clutter. Don't keep things in your workspace just in case, don't buy things just in case. The future is a mystery, let it remain that way. -- QUOTES: ""Most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you'll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, 'Is this necessary?'"" – Marcus Aurelius ""Without great solitude no serious work is possible."" – Pablo Picasso Nikola Tesla: ""The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone -- that is the secret of invention: be alone, that is when ideas are born.""","Nice short reminder of the importance of solitude and focus. Single-tasking. Only doing your most important things, and let the rest go."
The Upside of Irrationality,Dan Ariely,0061995037,4,"The real goal of behavioral economics: to try to understand the way we really operate so that we can more readily observe our biases, be more aware of their influences on us, and hopefully make better decisions. We routinely behave as if sometime in the future, we will have more time, more money, and feel less tired or stressed. “Later” seems like a rosy time to do all the unpleasant things in life. Over-motivation to perform well can stem from electrical shocks, from high payments, or from social pressures. In all these cases humans and nonhumans alike seem to perform worse when it is in their best interest to truly outdo themselves. What is the correct way to pay people without overstressing them? Pay employees on a straight salary basis. Offer employees smaller and more frequent bonuses. Another approach might be to offer employees a performance-based payment that is averaged over time - say, the previous five years, rather than only the last year. This way, employees in their fifth year would know 80 percent of their bonus in advance (based on the previous four years). Imagine that you work for some company and your task is to create PowerPoint slides. Every time you finish, someone takes the slides you’ve just made and deletes them. As you do this, you get paid well and enjoy great fringe benefits. There is even someone who does your laundry. How happy would you be to work in such a place? Contrafreeloading: many animals prefer to earn food rather than simply eating identical but freely accessible food. Among all the animals tested so far the only species that prefers the lazy route is the commendably rational cat. Maybe we feel meaning only when we deal with something bigger. Perhaps we hope that someone else, especially someone important to us, will ascribe value to what we’ve produced? Maybe we need the illusion that our work might one day matter to many people. That it might be of some value in the big, broad world out there. Doing something that is somewhat connected to our self-image can fuel our motivation and get us to work much harder. Without an audience, I would have very little motivation to work as hard as I do. The translation of joy into willingness to work seems to depend to a large degree on how much meaning we can attribute to our own labor. Sucking the meaning out of work is surprisingly easy. If you’re a manager who really wants to demotivate your employees, destroy their work in front of their eyes. Or, if you want to be a little subtler about it, just ignore them and their efforts. On the other hand, if you want to motivate people working with you and for you, it would be useful to pay attention to them, their effort, and the fruits of their labor. One of the dangers of work-based technology. Modern IT infrastructure allows us to break projects into very small, discrete parts and assign each person to do only one of the many parts. In so doing, companies run the risk of taking away employees’ sense of the big picture, purpose, and sense of completion. Highly divisible labor might be efficient if people were automatons, but, given the importance of internal motivation and meaning to our drive and productivity, this approach might backfire. Allow employees to feel a sense of completion and ensure that a job well done is acknowledged. Semi-cooked meals: The delicate balance between the desire to feel pride of ownership and the wish to not spend too much time in the kitchen. Creators had a substantial bias when evaluating their own work. Noncreators viewed the amateurish art as useless and the professional versions as much, much more exciting. In contrast, the creators saw their own work as almost as good as the experts’. Once we build something, we do, in fact, view it with more loving eyes. We are largely unaware of this tendency; we mistakenly think that others love our work as much as we do. Does this mean that companies should always require their customers to do the design work and labor on every product? Of course not. There is a delicate trade-off between effortlessness and investment. Ask people to expend too much effort, and you can drive them away; ask them for too little effort, and you are not providing the opportunities for customization, personalization, and attachment. It all depends on the importance of the task and on the personal investment in the product category. To increase your feelings of pride and ownership in your daily life, you should take a larger part in creating more of the things you use in your daily life. Investing more effort does, indeed, increase our affection, but only when the effort leads to completion. When the effort is unfruitful, affection for one’s work plummets. We like sitting in a garden but don’t want to get sweaty and dirty digging up a garden space or mowing the lawn, so we pay a gardener to cut the grass and plant some flowers. We want to enjoy a nice meal, but shopping and cooking are too much trouble, so we eat out or just pop something into the microwave. Sadly, in surrendering our effort in these activities, we gain relaxation, but we may actually give up a lot of deep enjoyment. It’s often effort that ultimately creates long-term satisfaction. It might be that others can do better wiring work or gardening, but you might ask yourself, “How much more will I enjoy my new television/stereo setup/garden/meal after I work on it?” If you suspect you would enjoy it more, maybe those are cases where investing more effort will pay off. Even if their ideas weren’t superior to ours overall, it could have been that our participants’ notions fit better with their own unique perspectives of the world. This principle is called an idiosyncratic fit. As an extreme example of this, imagine that a devoutly religious individual answered the question “How can individuals help to promote our ‘gross national happiness’?” by suggesting that everyone attend religious services daily. A steadfast atheist might respond to the same question by suggesting that everyone give up religion and focus instead on following the right kind of diet and exercise program. Each person may prefer his or her idea to ours - not because he or she came up with it but because it idiosyncratically fits with his or her underlying beliefs and preferences. Not-Invented-Here bias is fondly called the “toothbrush theory.” The idea is that everyone wants a toothbrush, everyone needs one, everyone has one, but no one wants to use anyone else’s. Regardless of what we create - a toy box, a new source of electricity, a new mathematical theorem - much of what really matters to us is that it is our creation. As long as we create it, we tend to feel rather certain that it’s more useful and important than similar ideas that other people come up with. If you helped your kids plant vegetables in the garden: Chances are that if your kids grow their own lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers and help prepare them for a dinner salad, they will actually eat (and love) their veggies. The threat of revenge - even at great personal expense - can serve as an effective enforcement mechanism that supports social cooperation and order. The word “sorry” completely counteracted the effect of annoyance. Walter Weckler further observed that “revenge has no more quenching effect on emotions than salt water has on thirst.” Participants who had been mildly injured reported that the hot water became painful (pain threshold) after about 4.5 seconds Those who had been severely injured started feeling pain after 10 seconds. More interestingly, those in the mildly injured group removed their hands from the hot water (pain tolerance) after about 27 seconds, while the severely injured individuals kept their hands in the hot water for about 58 seconds. There seems to be generalized adaptation involved in the process of acclimating to pain. People with injuries learn to associate pain with hope for a good outcome. This link between suffering and hope eliminates some of the fear inherent in painful experiences. On the other hand, the two chronically ill individuals who took part in our pain study could not make any connection between their pain and a hope for improvement. They most likely associated pain with getting worse and the proximity of death. In the absence of any positive association, pain must have felt more frightening and more intense for them. Job satisfaction among British workers was strongly correlated with changes in workers’ pay rather than the level of pay itself. In other words, people generally grow accustomed to their current pay level, however low or high. Hedonic adaptation can be a problem for effective decision making because we often cannot accurately predict that we will adapt - at least not to the level that we actually do. Think again about the paraplegics and lottery winners. Neither they nor their families and friends could have predicted the extent to which they would adapt to their new situations. Of course, the same applies to many other variations in our circumstance. We expect that we will be miserable for a long time if things do not work out the way we hope We also think that we will be enduringly happy if things go our way. But in general, our predictions are off base. You may think that taking a break during an irritating or boring experience will be good for you, but a break actually decreases your ability to adapt, making the experience seem worse when you have to return to it. When cleaning your house or doing your taxes, the trick is to stick with it until you are done. Slow down pleasure. A new couch may please you for a couple of months, but don’t buy your new television until after the thrill of the couch has worn off. The opposite holds if you are struggling with economic cutbacks. When reducing consumption, you should move to a smaller apartment, give up cable television, and cut back on expensive coffee all at once - sure, the initial pain will be larger, but the total amount of agony over time will be lower. We have a tendency to take the safe and predictable path at work, and by extension in our personal life, and do the things that provide steady and reliable progress. But real progress - as well as real pleasure - comes from taking risks and trying very different things. Imagine that you have just arrived at a party. As you walk in, the host writes a number on your forehead. He instructs you not to look at the mirror or ask anyone about it. You look around the room and see that the other men and women have numbers from 1 to 10 written on their foreheads. The host tells you that your goal is to pair up with the highest-numbered person who is willing to talk to you. Naturally, you walk up to a 10, but he or she gives you one look and walks away. You then look for 9s or 8s and so on, until a 4 extends a hand to you and you go together to get a drink. This simple game describes the basic process of assortative mating. “One man’s death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic.” - Stalin “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will.” - Mother Teresa “The identifiable victim effect”: Once we have a face, a picture, and details about a person, we feel for them, and our actions - and money - follow. However, when the information is not individualized, we simply don’t feel as much empathy and, as a consequence, fail to act. Once we choose to act on our emotions, we make short-term decisions that change our long-term situation. If we do nothing while we are feeling an emotion, there is no short-or-long-term harm that can come to us. However, if we react to the emotion by making a decision, we may not only regret the immediate outcome, but we may also create a long-lasting pattern of decisions that will continue to misguide us for a long time. Before committing to any long-term relationship you should first explore your joint behavior in environments that don’t have well-defined social protocols. Keep an eye open for deteriorating patterns of behavior. When we observe early-warning signs, we should take swift action to correct an undesirable course before the unfortunate patterns of dealing with each other fully Despite the fact that I understand and can analyze some of my decision biases, I still experience them. They never completely cease to influence me. This is something to keep in mind as you attempt to become a better decision maker. We need to doubt our intuitions. If we keep following our gut and common wisdom or doing what is easiest or most habitual just because “well, things have always been done that way,” we will continue to make mistakes - resulting in a lot of time, effort, heartbreak, and money going down the same old (often wrong) rabbit holes. But if we learn to question ourselves and test our beliefs, we might actually discover when and how we are wrong and improve the ways we love, live, work, innovate, manage, and govern. The importance of experiments as one of the best ways to learn what really works and what does not. I’m surprised that the importance of experiments isn’t recognized more broadly, especially when it comes to important decisions in business or public policy. Frankly, I am often amazed by the audacity of the assumptions that businesspeople and politicians make, coupled with their seemingly unlimited conviction that their intuition is correct. Recognize the upside of irrationality that some of the ways in which we are irrational are also what makes us wonderfully human our ability to find meaning in work our ability to fall in love with our creations and ideas our willingness to trust others our ability to adapt to new circumstances our ability to care about others and so on Looking at irrationality from this perspective suggests that rather than strive for perfect rationality, we need to appreciate those imperfections that benefit us, recognize the ones we would like to overcome, and design the world around us in a way that takes advantage of our incredible abilities while overcoming some of our limitations. One of the best ways to discover our mistakes and the different ways to overcome them is by running experiments, gathering and scrutinizing data, comparing the effect of the experimental and control conditions,","First read his amazing book “Predictably Irrational.” But if you read and loved it, then this is a continuation with some more examples - mostly organizational. He also catharticly details his own painful injuries in every chapter."
Confessions of a Public Speaker,Scott Berkun,0596801998,4,"It’s an amazing way to live, getting paid to think and learn and exchange ideas. My goal is to see how long I can make an independent living purely on the merits of what I write and what I say. If you love ideas, speaking and writing are natural consequences. You know about history’s great thinkers because they either spoke or they wrote. I hope to be a great thinker someday, and I know the way to get there is to speak and write. Expressing ideas is often the only way to fully understand what ideas are, and to know what it is you really think. Expression makes learning from the criticism of others possible, and I’m happy to look like a fool if in return I learn something I wouldn’t have learned any other way. I’m fascinated by ideas of all kinds, in wildly different subjects, and I hope to write and speak about them all. I’m insanely grateful to make a living as a trafficker of ideas. I hope to be able to do it for the rest of my life. Public speaking is a form of expression. You have to do it about a topic, and whatever that topic is defines you better than the actual speaking does. But I speak about the things I write about, which can be just about anything. Calling myself a freelance thinker - as vacuous as it sounds - is accurate. If some disaster happens, something explodes or I trip and fall, I’ll have more attention from the audience than I probably had 30 seconds before. And if I don’t care that much about my disaster, I can use the attention I’ve earned and do something good with it - whatever I say next, they are sure to remember. If you’d like to be good at something, the first thing to go out the window is the notion of perfection. Obsessing about perfection stops you from growing. You stop taking chances, which means you stop learning. I don’t want to be perfect. I want be useful. I was given 10 minutes to speak, and since the average person speaks 2–3 words per second, all you need is 1,500 words of material (600 seconds x 2.5 words per second). The things speakers obsess about are the opposite of what the audience cares about. They want to be entertained. They want to learn. And most of all, they want you to do well. The mistakes you make before you even say a word that matter more. These include the mistakes of... * not having an interesting opinion * not thinking clearly about your points * not planning ways to make those points relevant to your audience. Those are the ones that make the difference. If you can figure out how to get those right, not much else will matter. Fear focuses attention. All the fun, interesting things in life come with fears. All good things come with the possibility of failure. Practice: stand up at your desk, imagine an audience around you, and present exactly as if it were the real thing. But I don’t practice to make perfect, and I don’t memorize. If I did either, I’d sound like a robot, or worse, like a person trying very hard to say things in an exact, specific, and entirely unnatural style, which people can spot a mile away. My intent is simply to know my material so well that I’m very comfortable with it. Confidence, not perfection, is the goal. Can I make this work if I try it again? Does this slide or the previous one need to change? Can a photograph and a story replace all this text? Is there a better lead-in to this point from the previous point? Will things improve if I just rip this point/slide/idea out completely? I repeat this process until I can get through the entire talk without making major mistakes. I want to make my body as relaxed as possible and exhaust as much physical energy early in the day. As a rule, I go to the gym the morning before a talk, with the goal of releasing any extra nervous energy before I get on stage. For private functions - say, when Google or Ferrari throws an annual event for their employees - how much would it be worth to have a speaker who can make their staff a little smarter, better, or more motivated when returning to work? The ideal room for a lecture is a theater. Ask the crowd if they’re too cold or too warm, and then, on the mike, ask the organizers to do something about it (even if they can’t, you look great by being the only speaker to give a care about how the audience is feeling). Hear the previous speaker. Sometimes you’ll hear a joke or comment in the previous talk that you can pick up on, or know to avoid, given that it’s been used before. Being paranoid has strikingly good odds of creating what we’re afraid of, perpetuating the paranoia. I have to embody what I want the audience to be. If I want them to have fun, I have to have fun. If I want them to laugh, I have to laugh. But it has to be done in a way they can connect with, which is hard to do. A drunken toast at a wedding is often great fun for the toaster but miserable for everyone else. But great speakers are connection-makers, sharing an authentic part of themselves to create a singular, positive experience for the audience. I’ve never claimed to have a new idea. I deal with the obvious. I present, reiterate, and glorify the obvious - because the obvious is what people need to be told. The greatest need of people is to know how to deal with other people. This should come naturally to them, but it doesn’t. - (Dale Carnegie) The problem with most bad presentations I see is not the speaking, the slides, the visuals, or any of the things people obsess about. Instead, it’s the lack of thinking. All good public speaking is based on good private thinking. Transform a rough set of ideas into clear points. As you plan your talk, start with the goal of satisfying the things listed below. People come because they: Want to learn something Wish to be inspired Hope to be entertained Have a need they hope you will satisfy Desire to meet other people interested in the subject Seek a positive experience they can share with others Are forced to be there by their bosses, parents, professors, or spouses When 100 people are listening to you for an hour, that’s 100 hours of people’s time devoted to what you have to say. If you can’t spend 5 or 10 hours preparing for them, thinking about them, and refining your points to best suit their needs, what does that say about your respect for your audience’s time? TITLE Take a strong position in the title. All talks and presentations have a point of view, and you need to know what yours is. Start with a strong title. Titles get so little attention, but they’re always the first words on your slides. And if you’re speaking at an event or conference, it’s how people choose whether they want to attend your session. If I call it “Creativity for beginners.” I have already set myself up to fail. How can I possibly say everything a beginner needs to know about creativity? And why would the audience care to know everything? That would be boring and take forever. Good lectures are never comprehensive because it’s the wrong format to do so. A better title would be, “How to be creative in doing boring work” or “Green eggs and brainstorming: how to learn creativity from reading Dr. Seuss.” People really want insight. They want an angle. A good speaker or teacher finds it for them. You can rip off any of the following titles and be well on your way to a stronger presentation: The top five problems you have with _____ and how to solve them Why _____ sucks and what we can do about it Mistakes I made in _____ and what I learned The most frequently asked questions and brilliant answers about _____ The truth about _____ and how it can help you Smart shortcuts and clever tricks only experts know about _____ The five reasons you win by giving me _____ Why _____ will change your life forever, for free, right now Think carefully about your specific audience. Know why they are there, what their needs are, what background knowledge they have, the pet theories they believe in, and how they hope their world will be different after your lecture is over. Make your specific points as concise as possible. Every point should be compressed into a single, tight, interesting sentence. The arguments might be long, but no one should ever be confused as to what your point is while you are arguing it. Know the likely counterarguments from an intelligent, expert audience. If you do not know the intelligent counterarguments to each of your points, your points cannot be good. Having thought clearly through my points, even if I lose the specific way I had hoped to present them, I can still offer them to my audience. If I’m fluent in my research, I can offer those anecdotes naturally. In effect, by working hard on a clear, strong, well-reasoned outline, I’ve already built three versions of the talk: 1. an elevator pitch (the title) 2. a five-minute version (saying each point and a brief summary) 3. the full version (with slides, movies, and whatever else strengthens each point). Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt all used a short outline of five or six points - often with just a few words per point - to help them recall their hour-long speeches while giving them. If you do enough thinking in advance, all your brain needs is a little list, and most of the speaking will take care of itself When the entire audience goes silent. All the conversations and rustlings stop, and everyone, at about the same time, falls into quiet anticipation for what is about to happen. This is called the hush over the crowd, but really it’s the moment when the crowd itself first forms. The 200 unique people with different thoughts and ideas now become one single entity, joining together for the first time to give their unified attention to the front of the room. And the strange part is that the audience gives control over to the unknown. They have not seen the movie before. They haven’t heard the lecture or seen the play. It’s an act of respect and an act of hope - and it’s amazing. There are only a few things in the world that can silence a room full of people, and the beginning of a performance is one of them. That special moment is the only time I will have the entire audience’s full attention. How well I’ll do starts with how I use the power of that moment. How will I keep people’s attention after that moment is gone? Never spend more than 10 minutes on a single point Structure the entire lecture around a sequence of points you know the audience is interested in hearing. We distribute power unevenly by design; for example, we have 100 senators, 50 governors, and only one president, and each has magnitudes more power than the citizens he or she represents. Uneven distribution of power is necessary to get things done efficiently. For much of the history of civilization, the only public speakers were chiefs, kings, and pharaohs. But few speakers use the enormous potential of this power. Most speakers are so afraid to do anything out of the ordinary that they squander the very power the audience hopes they will use. The easiest way to use power is to set the pace. “I have 30 minutes to talk to you, and five points to make. I will spend five minutes on each point and save the remaining time for any questions.” That takes about 10 seconds to say, but for that small price I continue to own the attention of the room because they know the plan. Once you have everyone’s attention, briefly outline how things will work. Something is wrong if 60 seconds go by and you aren’t already into your first point. Don’t waste time giving your resume or telling the back story (“I first read about blah blah at blah blah”). They don’t care. Think of your opening minute as a movie preview: fill it with drama, excitement, and highlights for why people should keep listening. The best way to direct attention is to tell a story the audience cares about. Then they have two reasons to be interested: the situation and who it’s happening to. “Here’s line 5 of the new tax code.” That’s just a boring fact, floating in space, encouraging people to put their attention elsewhere. It’s quite another to say: “80% of you in the audience confused line 5 with line 6 on your last tax return, which cost you $500. Here’s how to not make that mistake.” Even a topic as mind-numbingly dull as tax forms becomes interesting if the speaker cares both about the problem and the people affected by it. Influence is a function of grabbing someone’s attention, connecting to what they already feel is important, and linking that feeling to whatever you want them to see, do, or feel. It is easier if you let your story land first, and then draw the circle of meaning/connection around it using what you see and hear in the responses of your listeners. If they give you an hour of their time to talk to them, they expect you to be confident in what you say and do. If you fumble with the remote for your laptop, get confused by your own slides, or apologize for not being more prepared for the presentation, you are making it clear that you are not worthy of their attention. You are not playing the role they expect - that of a confident, clear, motivated, and possibly entertaining expert on something. You do not have to be perfect, but you do need to play the part. In other words, be bigger than you are. Speak louder, take stronger positions, and behave more aggressively than you would in an ordinary conversation. These are the rules of performing. A common mistake people make is to shrink onstage. Don't become overly polite and cautious. Be a passionate, interested, fully present version of you. The study of acting is not the practice of being fake. It’s learning how to become more expressive as yourself and applying that to life on stage and off. All communicators benefit from learning about theater. I could know half as much on a subject as my audience, yet still amaze, surprise, and entertain them by how I weave my stories together. This makes the transitions between slides critically important. I have to know what’s coming next and set up what I say on the current slide to make the following pay off. Doing this well depends on how much I practice. I can’t remember the transitions between points or how one story will best tie in to the next unless I’ve rehearsed and learned how to do it. The simplest kind of tension to build and then release is problem and solution. If your talk consists of several problems important to the audience, and you promise to release the tension created by those problems by solving each one, you’ll score big. The audience will follow you through each sequence of tension and release. If you do a great job with the first problem you identify, and offer a practical or inspiring way to handle it, they’ll stay with you throughout your entire talk. During your talk, you can also use the audience to get feedback about your pace. Ask, “How many of you think I’m going too slow?”, followed by, “How many think I’m going too fast?” You now have real-time data and can adjust accordingly. The stupidest thing for a speaker to ask his audience is, “Any questions on what I just said?” This sounds threatening, like he’s daring you to challenge his authority, which many people won’t want to take on. Instead, make it positive and interactive. Say, “Is there anything you’d like me to clarify?” Let the audience help tell your stories or show what they know: “Anyone here know who invented cheesecake?” Then give out prizes, decent things like copies of your book, items you know are popular with the crowd, or $10 gift certificates to Starbucks. The audience attention level will definitely rise. If you know of interesting, challenging problems related to your topic, pose them to your audience. Pick problems small enough that they can be solved in 30–60 seconds. Even if no one answers the questions you’re asking, more people will be listening to the silence in the room than were listening to you talking before the room went silent. Never be afraid to enforce the rules you know the room wants you to follow. When in doubt, ask the room for a show of hands: “Should we continue with this topic or move on?” If they vote to move on, that’s what you should do. When you enforce a popular rule, you reengage everyone who supports that rule. You restore your power and earn the audience’s respect. Don’t hesitate to cut off a blowhard, silence the guy on his cell phone, and interrupt the table having a private but distracting conversation. As long as you are polite and direct, you’ll be a hero. Always plan and practice to end early. The big lesson from being on television is simple: we are always performing. Any time you open your mouth and expect someone to listen, you are behaving differently than you would if you were alone. The bigger the audience, the bigger you need to be. Your voice needs to be louder, your hand gestures more dramatic, and your pace more upbeat. This is especially true for television. Since your appearance might be on a tiny TV in someone’s living room or in a browser window on his computer, you have to act big to project yourself across that distance. Make whatever medium you’re in feel like something simpler and often less formal. It’s the art of making the unnatural seem natural. Doing anything interesting puts you in a position to regularly hear conflicting feedback. Sometimes the feedback isn’t even about your work - you’re just an easy target for whatever venom has been building up in their lives. You are simply the first thing people have been put in a position to judge after days of being cruelly judged by others. They want to vent, and vent all over you. When talking to a performer after his performance, most people will say nice, simple, positive things. As a result, there are thousands of bad public speakers running around under the impression that they’re doing OK. People expect very little from most teachers. When listening to a lecture, most people are quite happy to just be entertained Credibility comes from the host. If the host says, “This is an expert on X,” people will believe it. People are willing to assume credibility based on how and by whom the speaker was introduced. Your appearance, manner, posture, and attitude matter. Every audience expects certain superficial things, and if you deliver them, the rest of your job is easier. The more I seem to care, the more likely people in the audience will care as well. Here’s some of the real feedback speakers need: How did my presentation compare to the others? What one change would have most improved my presentation? What questions did you expect me to answer that went unanswered? What annoyances did I let get in the way of giving you what you needed? Better questions to ask attendees include: Was this a good use of your time? Would you recommend this lecture to others? Are you considering doing anything different as a result of this talk? Do you know what to do next to continue learning? Were you inspired or motivated? How likeable did you find the speaker? How substantive did you find the speaker’s material? Ask the students a week or a month later. (to see what they really retained) Use technology to help show you what you actually did. If you’re too scared to watch yourself speak, how can you expect your audience to watch you? Don’t ask people to listen to something you haven’t listened to yourself. Just do it. If you don’t like what you see, make it shorter. Go for 30 seconds - short, commercial-length material - and practice it until you can do it well. Then add more. Students are always at more risk than their teachers, which helps explain some students’ delinquent behavior. They are afraid of failing, or being criticized and embarrassed in front of the class, so they reject the teacher first. Ever wonder why many schoolteachers seem so tired, so mean, so burnt-out on life? They didn’t start that way. Teaching anything year after year, while watching so many students struggle to grasp your lessons, eats away at your soul and can’t help but overtake the love that drove you to teach in the first place. When it works, teaching is one of the most rewarding experiences there is. Seeing an idea you’ve explained be understood and successfully applied by someone is unlike any other pleasure in life. If you have two dedicated, reasonably intelligent people, one interested in teaching and the other wanting to learn, something great can happen. Think master and apprentice, mentor and protégé. For learning, small numbers win. The success of this one-on-one method is proven throughout history; many so-called prodigies were tutored by a parent or family friend (Einstein, Picasso, and Mozart all qualify). Yes, they had amazing, inherent talent, but they were still privately taught by people invested in their learning. Teaching is intimacy of the mind, and you can’t achieve that if you must work in large numbers. Three things my brother did that anyone trying to teach must do, and it’s no surprise that they’re easier to do with a smaller number of students: Make it active and interesting. Start with an insight that interests the student. Adapt to how the student responds to #1 and #2. ""I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."" As difficult as lecturing is, giving the audience things to do is much more difficult. The teacher has to get out of the way; instead of being the star, he is the facilitator who helps students gain experience. The teacher can achieve this through exercises, games, and challenges where he plays a supporting rather than a primary role. If you want to teach a behavior skill, at some stage the student should practice it. This explains why many professors and gurus who are fantastic lecturers are somehow awful teachers. When their “students” leave, they don’t know how to apply anything they heard in the lecture. Given the lecturer’s brilliance, the students assume they are the problem and give up. Create exercises for your students to practice specific skills, then divide them into small groups so they can collaborate and apply the ideas explained in the lectures. People never fall asleep if they are at the center of the experience. Inform everyone that they can ask “Who Gives A Damn?” at any moment, and do your best to explain how whatever obscure thing you're talking about connects to why they are here. Focusing on facts and knowledge makes it easy for the teacher to stay in control and at the center of the experience. In reality, the ability to do something only has a limited relationship to the quantity of knowledge you have. Keep your hard-earned knowledge in mind, but simultaneously remember how it felt to be a complete novice. Ask yourself, at different points during the presentation: Do they know this fact or lesson already? Do they need me to explain this point in a different way? Are they saturated with information and need a break or a laugh? Are they too cocky and need a challenge? It’s impossible to teach well without learning something along the way. Good teachers listen as much as they talk, improving their material based on what they hear and studying to see if it had the positive effects they hoped. While I love talking with interesting, friendly people, I’m extremely happy all on my own. People who are at the center of attention when working - like comedians, teachers, and lecturers - are quieter than average off stage. They exhaust much of their social energy while working. If you have an interesting opinion, laugh often, and bring a nice bottle of wine, I would love to talk with you. But all things equal, I’m extremely happy with a good book and a nice view. I studied improv theater. There I learned how to see and how to listen. Humor and insight come from paying attention, not from special talents. The easiest way to be interesting is to be honest. People rarely say what they truly feel, yet this is what audiences desire most. If you can speak a truth most people are afraid to say, you’re a hero. Dress shirts are the best, most reliable way to clip on these microphones. Treat your cameramen well. They can do all kinds of things to make you look or sound stupid. Ask their advice. Use emphasis to help make each point as clear as possible. You can listen to any great speaker and break down each sentence he says purely by where he places emphasis. He will use different kinds of emphasis, such as repeating words, pausing, gesturing with his hands, or even speaking with a whisper. Most people say “umm” and “uhh” when they speak. These are called filler sounds We make them mostly to hold our place in conversation. You’re letting the people you’re talking to know you are not done speaking. When presenting, this isn’t necessary since you’re the only one with the microphone. Saying “ummm” is bad. Nothing kills your power over a room as much as a lack of silence. Silence establishes a baseline of energy in the room. Sometimes when a room is silent, people pay more attention than when you are speaking. Listen to stand-up comedians: about 20–30% of their time on the microphone is spent in silence, often just to let the audience laugh and enjoy the last thing said, or to provide a pacing break to set up the next thing they want to say. Silence provides time for consolidation and thought. Their timings requires the skill of an actor. They are useful after rhetorical questions, or when a problem has been posed. When you step to the front of the room, make sure you don’t behave like someone who has never been in the front of the room before. No audience wants to feel they are your dry run, unless somehow your experimenting makes it fun for them (which it probably won’t). If the pace of your presentation is unclear, or you’re not sure what direction you are going in, you are a turtle on crack. Provide a rhythm the audience can follow. Have a well-defined, simple, uniform pace. Divide your time into the number of points you want to make and spend an equal amount of time on each one. You can subdivide each point into individual arguments, which should also have a clear, simple rhythm to follow. Little gestures you repeat can be distracting. If you keep rubbing your nose or putting your hands into and out of your pockets, eventually this draws attention away from what you are saying. We all have pet phrases we use too much, like saying, “This is about,” “So now…,” or “And here we have” to introduce every slide. There are always alternative ways to say the same thing, but first you have to notice which phrases you rely on more. You need to appear natural enough that people can focus on what you’re saying, and you seem happy to be up there. Few people speak passionately. They think they’re being passionate, but to the audience they come off as only mildly engaging. Reestablish the attention of the room every 10 minutes just to get a baseline of who is still with you. Sometimes I say the following: “Here’s a deal. I’d like you to give me your undivided attention for five minutes. If after five minutes you’re bored, you think I’m an idiot, or you’d rather browse the Web than listen, you’re free to do so. In fact, I won’t mind if you get up and leave after five minutes. But for the first 300 seconds, please give me your undivided attention.” Most people close their laptops. Keep in mind that some people take notes on their laptops. They might be live blogging or tweeting what you’re saying, vastly increasing your audience beyond the room. An open laptop doesn’t always mean you’re being ignored. Your host is your guide. He should tell you if there is something you need to know, like recent layoffs or other bad news that might be on people’s minds. If you’re paranoid, you can ask, “Is there anything that happened recently I should know about?” BOOKS: Ken Bain’s excellent book, ""What the Best College Teachers Do"" See ""An Actor Prepares"" by Constantin Stanislavski BUY: the Logitech Cordless Presenter",Best book on public speaking. A must-read if you do this at all. Great concrete advice and personal tales.
The Profit Zone,Adrian Slywotzky,0812933044,4,"The number one problem in business today is profitability. Where will you be allowed to make a profit in your industry? Where is the profit zone today? Where will it be tomorrow? The profit zone is the area of your economic neighborhood where you are allowed to earn a profit. To reach and operate in the profit zone is the goal of every company. Am I managing for market share, or for profit? Is the market share I own profitable and alive, or is it profitless and dead? Fast-growing industries such as PC manufacturing, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and software have each produced scores of terminally unprofitable companies. By contrast, no-growth or low-growth industries have produced some of the most successful companies in the world. Coca-Cola achieved significant value growth in the low-growth beverage industry, as did General Electric (GE) in a collection of low-growth manufacturing industries, and Swatch in the low-growth watchmaking industry. Contenders to match price reductions or lose customers to a lower-priced competitor. It creates no-profit zones. No-profit zones come in various forms. - value chain (distribution in computing or the grocery segment in carbonated beverages) - individual customers (Wal-Mart or other large, powerful buyers) - entire business models (hub-and-spoke airlines) The devout pursuit of market share may be the single greatest creator of no-profit zones in the economy. The euphoria of being in a high-growth environment blocks out the reality that growth creates a much higher management challenge. The curse of growth arises when a business grows by stretching its business design to serve customers that the business design was not intended to serve. Activities that were once valuable turn profitless. Value migrates toward activities that are more important to customers - activities where profit is possible. Start with the profit question (“Where will I be allowed to make a profit?”) and work your way back. 1. What’s most important to the customer? 2. Where can we make a profit? 3. How can we gain market share in that space? Expand your repertoire of strategic and tactical moves. If the business is to succeed, it must be designed in such a way that its key elements are aligned with customers’ most important priorities. It must be designed for profitability. A more extensive repertoire of value capture mechanisms than they ever have before: financing, ancillary products, solutions, downstream participation in the value chain, value sharing, licensing, Which customers I choose depends on which customers will allow me to make a profit. Great business design is a combination of superb knowledge about customers and profit (“You can’t intuit the facts”), together with great strategic imagination. The reinventors’ unique skill is strategic creativity: constantly reversing traditional assumptions, developing new options, and making more inspired choices. Must be reinvented as customers’ needs and priorities change and as value migrates away from the industry’s traditional business designs. Just as products become technologically obsolete, business designs become economically obsolete. Over time, because of the competitive nature of business, most business designs are no longer allowed to make a profit. Lew Platt, CEO of Hewlett-Packard, has an invaluable perspective on reinventing: “The single biggest problem in business is staying with your previously successful business model one year too long.” Where is the profit? In yesterday’s world, the answer was: with the player who has the highest market share. In today’s world, the answer is: with the player who has the best business model, a model designed for customer relevance and high profitability. To create a strategic and dynamic perspective on the customer, one must have a clear and compelling point of view on one question: Exactly how is the customer changing? Write this question down. It is your single most powerful management weapon. When companies succeed, a company’s center of gravity moves. A company focused on itself - its internal budgets, internal resource concerns, and internal politics - will have a great deal of difficulty with customer-centric thinking. Spend most of your time outside with customers. Don’t spend your time with customers who like you. Seek out the customers who are the most demanding, the angriest, and the most insightful about tomorrow. Don’t go into these customer dialogues asking yourself, “What do I need to know?” Ask the right questions, such as: “What am I afraid to find out?” Customer priorities are the things that are so important to customers that they will pay a premium for them or, when they can’t get them, they will switch suppliers. Decipher what customer priorities are being ignored (a clear link to the words in the left-hand column in Exhibit 2.4). • Invent a new business design that responds to those priorities. • Create a new profit zone with extraordinarily high profitability. Rigorous creativity to reach the silent needs. Business book publishers, for example, must understand booksellers, and corporations that buy books, and the individual readers within those companies. Hotel managers must understand travel agents, and corporations that have offsite meetings, and the human resources people who organize the corporate offsites, and the people at the company that will be attending the offsite. Expanding the customer field of vision is critical. Given three or four potential customers, who is the mose important? On whom should a business design be most sharply focused? If a skill is relevant to the customer and is not currently offered, the company must develop it, or hire it, or acquire it, or license it, or find a business partner who will provide it. Don’t make another major investment until you have satisfied yourself that the company knows exactly how it will make money and what tactical actions will be required to do so consistently. IBM, GM, Sears, Kodak, US Steel, United Airlines. The actual list is quite long. Market share leaders? Yes. Profitable? No. ############# CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT/ CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS PROFIT Invest heavily to understand their customers’ economics and find ways to make them more favorable. Reach the profit zone by first probing how their customers buy and use their products and then finding ways - beyond merely selling the products - to help the customers in the difficult, expensive, or time-consuming areas of their process. Customer selection and front-end-loaded customer investment were the means of creating customer continuity, which was the key driver of profit. Other successful firms that have applied the discipline of the customer development model include Nordstrom, the United States Auto Association (USAA), Intuit, Northwestern Life, and Leo Burnett, all of which have achieved significantly higher customer continuity than their competitors ############# PRODUCT PYRAMID PROFIT Customer preferences of style, color, price, and so on, are of utmost importance. The variations in customer income and preferences make it possible to build product pyramids. They exist in markets as diverse as watchmaking, automotive sales, and credit cards. The profit is concentrated at the top of the product pyramid. Build a “firewall” brand at the bottom of the pyramid: a strong, low-priced brand that is produced at a profit, however slim. The purpose of this brand is to deter competitor entry, thereby protecting the enormous profit margins at the top of the pyramid. When a firewall brand isn’t built, competitors have the opportunity to come in at the bottom and then work their way toward the top, where the profits are. Witness the history of the U.S. automotive market from 1965 to 1995. Japanese competitors first occupied the base with cars designed to be profitable, even at low price levels. They then moved up (Honda’s Acura, Toyota’s Lexus, Nissan’s Infiniti) to where the higher profits were. ############# MULTICOMPONENT SYSTEM PROFIT Failure to maximize participation in the highest-profit components depresses the profitability of the entire system. On the other hand, full participation in the less profitable components is required to win the market for the most profitable components. Grocery, 2 cents per ounce; fountain, 4 cents per ounce; vending, 6 cents In coffee, the components are grocery, cafés, and kiosks. Grocery is low margin, cafés are high margin, and kiosks are even higher still Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, and General Foods play against each other in grocery and break even. Starbuck’s plays in cafés and kiosks and enjoys extraordinary returns. Multicomponent profit models apply to industries as diverse as beverages (the profit is in fountain and vending) hotels (the base business has low margins, the corporate meeting business is highly profitable) bookstores (the bookstore itself is asset-intensive, low margin; the institutional business from corporations, book clubs, and other sources is high profit, low asset intensity. ############# SWITCHBOARD PROFIT Multiple sellers communicating to multiple buyers. High transaction costs are incurred by both. Often, there is an opportunity to create a high-value intermediary that concentrates these multiple communication pathways through one point, or one channel, by creating a “switchboard.” The switchboard reduces the costs (both financial expenditures and personal aggravation) of both buyers and sellers, in exchange for a fee to the switchboard operator. Examples include Schwab’s OneSource, Softbank’s combination of trade publications and trade shows, and Auto-by-Tel. It builds on itself. ############# TIME PROFIT Innovator to generate excess returns before imitators begin to erode margins. ############# BLOCKBUSTER PROFIT Essential for pharmaceutical companies, publishers, film studios, music companies, and software firms, which have large R&D and launch costs, and finite product cycles. When the cost to develop a new product is fixed (and, usually, high) and marginal costs of manufacturing after development are low, the best way to maximize profits is to improve the chances that the product will achieve very high volume levels. With these economics, it is better to be the dominant leader in a few products than to support average positions in many products. ############# PROFIT MULTIPLIER MODEL Reaps gains, over and over again, from the same product, character, trademark, capability, or service. The best example of a profit multiplier model is Disney. Think about how many different ways Disney packages the same characters. Mickey, Minnie, Hercules, et al. appear in movies, videos, and books; on clothes, watches, and lunch boxes; at theme parks. Once the investment (often, huge) in creating a brand has been made, the creator may give the brand license across a broad array of products. ############# ENTREPRENEURIAL PROFIT Many determinants of profitability are economic. Some are organizational. Customer relevance declines, and the expense structure grows. The company is vulnerable to entrepreneurs who are in direct contact with customers or proactively solicit feedback, and who remain frugal because they have no cushion of affordability to support unnecessary expenses. These twin forces of direct customer contact and extreme frugality create the potential for enormous profitability. ABB has broken itself down into 5,000 profit centers that have direct customer contact and direct profit responsibility. Softbank has divided itself into profit centers of as few as ten people, again with direct customer contact, and with a five-day cash flow metric. Upside motivation. The managers of the spin-outs own stock in the spin-out company. Entrepreneurs hate to compete against Thermo Electron. They’d much rather compete against a larger, slower, more insulated player. It is easier to compete against employees than against owners. ############# SPECIALIZATION PROFIT Sequenced specialization can be extraordinarily profitable. Electronic Data Systems (EDS), for example, grew through sequenced specialization: Mastering the intricacies and economics of computer solutions for many vertical segments (health care, insurance, manufacturing, banking), but doing so sequentially, not simultaneously. In each vertical segment, EDS establishes expertise that is unmatched. ############# INSTALLED BASE PROFIT Supplier creates an extensive installed base of users, who then buy the supplier’s brand of consumables or follow-on products. Microsoft’s strategy was to price low, set the standard, achieve ubiquity, and then harvest the profits from upgrade/revision revenue. ################# LOCAL LEADERSHIP PROFIT Starbuck’s conquered Seattle first, then Chicago, then Vancouver. Starbuck’s understood that its economics were local - logistics, word of mouth, recruiting. It exploited those economies to grow profitably, not just grow. ################# TRANSACTION SCALE PROFIT Transaction scale businesses reward those who control the largest transactions. Customer selection - investing in those customers with the largest deals - is key. In these businesses - typified by investment banking, real estate, commercial lending, long-distance haulage, long-distance travel, etc. - costs do not rise as rapidly as fees as a function of transaction size. Two equal market shares - one composed of a hundred small deals, the other of five or six big ones - will not produce equivalent levels of profitability. The latter will be several times more profitable than the former. The costs incurred by Morgan Stanley to manage a $100 million financing were not dramatically greater than the costs of a $5 million financing. ############# LOW COST BY DESIGN: You can trump cumulative experience with a low-cost business design, which makes the incumbent’s cumulative experience irrelevant. Nucor did this in steel (the minimill model trumped the integrated mill) Southwest Air, in air travel (the point-to-point model trumped hub-and-spoke) Dell, in computing (direct marketing trumped a feet-on-the-street sales force and multilevel distribution channels). The player focused on building cumulative experience to gain lowest cost is always vulnerable to the player who creates a low-cost position through design. ================== A lack of frugality was accepted as the norm in her company. “We’re not very careful about our dollars,” she said. “We stay in the best hotels, the annual sales meeting is in a fancy Florida resort, we eat well, we don’t buy our airline tickets far enough in advance to save on the fare. We’ve come to think that this is how it’s meant to be.” She described the very human, organizational consequences of several years of corporate life in the land of illusion, the land of the “perpetual profit zone.” Once formed, these organizational habits are extremely hard to break. As the profit zone moves, they can prove fatal. Wal-Mart employees double up in budget hotels when they travel. Profitability is a game of inches. Transition to efficient company was effective. It drove return on sales up from a negative 4 percent to a positive 6 percent and kept it there. The same psychology could have been created 5 years earlier, but, until the crunch came, it wasn’t pursued. 1. Who are the most profitable customers? 2. Within that group, which customers have the highest profit growth potential? 3. What mix and level of investments are needed to meet those customers’ needs efficiently and enable profit growth to occur? In many companies, this profitability analysis has revealed that 10 to 15 percent of the customer base is unprofitable, consisting of buyers who absorb the company’s resources and do not provide a return. Strategic control points: brand patent copyright 2-year product development lead 20 percent cost advantage control of distribution control of supply owning customer information flow a unique organizational culture value chain control. Each control point is designed to keep a company in the profit zone and to prevent competitors from stealing away the profitability. Every good business design has at least one strategic control point. The best business designs have two or more. Intel, for example, has a 2-year lead, value chain control, and a brand. Coca-Cola has a brand, a low-cost logistics system, value chain management, and a string of superdominant positions. In value migration, customers move from A to B, and the profit zone moves from A to B with them. The incumbent stays at A. The newcomer builds a business design to go to B. This value shift has occurred often: from IBM to Microsoft and Intel USX to Nucor United Airlines to Southwest Air Computer-vision to Parametric Technology Folgers to Starbuck’s Kmart to Wal-Mart. Reinventing the business design by using customer-centric and profit-centric principles has great rewards. Customers return. Profits grow. Employee morale rebounds. Reinvention is about the customer and profitability, but ultimately it is about creativity, about designing a business model that is unique. Perhaps the most important benefit of studying any reinventors and how they discover or create the profit zone in their industries is grasping how the creative process works in business (how business designs change every 5 years), what discipline (in customer and profit thinking) it requires, and how extraordinary its outcomes can be. Business design innovation drives financial improvement, which drives increased valuation, which drives value growth. Business design innovation requires major nonincremental moves. Making such moves inevitably leads to major errors. Management is trying to perfect yesterday’s business design. The opportunity has passed them by, yet they believe that if they can only get a little bigger or do a little better, they can still win. They are fighting yesterday’s war. The battle meanwhile has moved on to an opportunity space redefined by new customer priorities. Be on the lookout for what the next metrics revolution will be. Understanding the fundamentals of business design innovation is perhaps the best preparation for an uncertain future. Move your company into the profit zone. The process involves addressing a sequence of twelve questions: 1. Who are my customers? 2. How are their priorities changing? 3. Who should be my customer? 4. How can I add value to the customer? 5. How can I become the customer’s first choice? 6. What is my profit model? 7. What is my current business design? 8. Who are my real competitors? 9. What is my toughest competitors’ business design? 10. What is my next business design? 11. What is my strategic control point? 12. What is my company worth? ******* 1. WHO ARE MY CUSTOMERS? Identifying customers really means being able to categorize them into distinct groups whose behavior can be analyzed accurately. try to segment your customers into different groups - for instance, by behavior or by priority. Coke’s Major Customer Groups 1. Consumers 2. Fountain and Vending Customers 3. Anchor Bottlers 4. National Chains Understand their priorities. Deciphering the priorities that are guiding your customers’ behavior. Name three products or services in your industry that have become popular over the past 2 years. Why did customers like them? What were the underlying reasons for the products’ value? Did they save money? Reduce hassle? Offer security? Repeat the above exercise but substitute an unrelated market or industry where your customers are actively engaged. What preferences do they express in that market? To discover what your customers’ silent or unspoken priorities are is to consider the entire economic system in which your customers operate. Imagine yourself as the CEO of each of your five most important customers (or as a head of household in your five most important demographic groups). What would your overall objectives be? What major concerns would you have? How could a supplier help you toward your goals? How is the supplier currently hindering you? ******* 2. HOW ARE THEIR PRIORITIES CHANGING? Changing customer priorities in the coffee industry (a priority shift away from price to quality, leading to a shift from grocery retail brands to specialty coffee stores) allowed Starbuck’s to prosper. Look at the other industries where your customers operate. Do you see any trends that may soon appear in your market? If customers are trying to save time in one of those areas, aren’t they likely to value saved time in yours? What advantages can you introduce now, or in the near future, to anticipate your customers’ preferences or needs? ******* 3. WHO Should BE MY CUSTOMER? Are there new groups who would value what you do? Can you jump a step along the value chain and serve your customers’ customers? Can you step in the other direction and become a supplier to other companies like your own? Innovative customer selection was critical to value creation for each of the reinventors. Roberto Goizueta realized that Coca-Cola had always thought of consumers as its target customers, when, in fact, bottlers were the buyers of Coca-Cola’s syrup and controlled the commercial availability of Coke beverages. He reoriented the company to see bottlers as the key customers in the system and began organizational reform that led to Coca-Cola’s low-cost distribution system. ******* 4. HOW CAN I ADD VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER? A business earns no profit when customers are willing to pay only the total cost of a product. Each company must ask itself: “What special benef it of our product will compel customers to pay us a premium?” The answer will always say, in some form: “Customers will pay us a premium if we meet their priorities, which are X, Y, and Z.” Which priorities are your competitors satisfying? Which priorities might you be able to serve better than your competitors can? Which priorities might you satisfy at a lower cost than your competitorsare charging? How large a premium will your customers pay to have each of their priorities met? Which set of priorities can you serve simultaneously in order to provide the most value for your customers? ******* 5. HOW CAN I BECOME THE CUSTOMER’S FIRST CHOICE? Who is your most important customer? What are that customer’s top three priorities? How do you score? How does your best competitor score? ******* 6. WHAT IS MY PROFIT MODEL? A business design that adds value to the customer but is not designed to create high profitability is an incomplete - and in many cases, a fatally defective - business design. Do any of these models apply to your business? Does more than one apply? Which ones? How does high profit happen in my business? Who is the most profitable company in my business, and why? Is there a picture that captures how profitability works in your business? Can you sketch it? What is on the X-axis? Time? Scale? How do the different pieces of your business relate to one another? Does everybody in my organization understand our profit model? Does the organization align its actions to create the conditions that will achieve high profitability? Do we make decisions and allocate resources based on this understanding? ******* 7. WHAT IS MY CURRENT BUSINESS DESIGN? A company’s business design is composed of four strategic elements: (1) customer selection (2) value capture (3) strategic control (4) scope The table below profiles these four strategic dimensions of business design. In the following chart, what options are relevant for your company? Examples of business design options: Customer Selection All segments Segment 1 Segment 2 Downstream customers Value capture Revenue per unit Licensing fees Service revenue Solutions revenue Strategic Control Brand Low Cost 2-year lead Customer relationship Scope Broad line Narrow line Fully integrated Virtual ******* 8. WHO ARE MY Real COMPETITORS? your true competitors are any companies that share your customers and/or your scope. Your competitors may be in industries that are different from yours.

Never Eat Alone,Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz,0385512058,4,"The people who had reached professional heights unknown to my father and mother helped each other. They found one another jobs, they invested time and money in one another’s ideas, and they made sure their kids got help getting into the best schools, got the right internships, and ultimately got the best jobs. Before my eyes, I saw proof that success breeds success and, indeed, the rich do get richer. Their web of friends and associates was the most potent club. Success in any field, but especially in business, is about working with people, not against them. Connecting: sharing my knowledge and resources, time and energy, friends and associates, and empathy and compassion in a continual effort to provide value to others, while coincidentally increasing my own. I learned that real networking was about finding ways to make other people more successful. It was about working hard to give more than you get. The key to success in one word: generosity. You’ve got to be more than willing to accept generosity. Often, you’ve got to go out and ask for it. Until you become as willing to ask for help as you are to give it, you are only working half the equation. A network functions precisely because there’s recognition of mutual need. There’s an implicit understanding that investing time and energy in building personal relationships with the right people will pay dividends. You can’t amass a network of connections without introducing such connections to others with equal fervor. If I’m going to take the time to meet with somebody, I’m going to try to make that person successful. It’s better to give before you receive. And never keep score. It’s easier to get ahead in the world when those below you are happy to help you get ahead, rather than hoping for your downfall. Which activities excite you the most, where you don’t even notice the hours that pass? Bill Clinton writing down details of each person: “I’m going into politics and plan to run for governor of Arkansas, and I’m keeping track of everyone I meet.” The forty-second president made it a nightly habit to record, on index cards, the names and vital information of every person whom he’d met that day. Clinton’s unique ability to create an almost instantaneous intimacy with whomever he’s talking to. Clinton doesn’t just recall your personal information; he uses the information as a means to affirm a bond with you. Viewing my employees as partners to be wooed in achieving my long-term objectives and theirs. “Dear Keith, I hear you’re a good networker. I am, too. Let’s sit down for fifteen minutes and a cup of coffee.” Why? I ask myself. Why in the world do people expect me to respond to a request like that? Have they appealed to me emotionally? Have they said they could help me? Have they sought some snippet of commonality between us? At a conference, when I run into someone I’ve been dying to meet, I don’t hide my enthusiasm. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you. I’ve admired your work from afar for quite some time and been thinking how beneficial it might be if we could meet one another.” Reaching out to others is not a numbers game. Your goal is to make genuine connections with people you can count on. An inner truth about the skill of reaching out to others: Those who are best at it don’t network - they make friends. Before I meet with any new people I’ve been thinking of introducing myself to, I research who they are and what their business is. I find out what’s important to them: their hobbies, challenges, goals - inside their business and out. Before the meeting, I generally prepare, or have my assistant prepare, a one-page synopsis on the person I’m about to meet. I want to know what this person is like as a human being, what he or she feels strongly about, and what his or her proudest achievements are. Be up-to-date on what’s happening within the company of a person you want to establish a relationship with. Did the person have a good or bad quarter? Do they have a new product? Trust me, all people naturally care, generally above and beyond anything else, about what it is they do. If you are informed enough to step comfortably into their world and talk knowledgeably, their appreciation will be tangible. As William James wrote: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” Setting out to know someone inevitably means understanding what their problems or needs are. Reach beyond the abstract and get to someone as an individual. Find a way to become part of those things that are of most interest to them, and you will have found a way to become part of their life. During mixers, I like to hang out near the bar. The challenge in such circumstances, as it is in every conversation, is to try to transcend the trivialities of polite chitchat. Find a point of common ground that is deeper and richer than what can be discovered in a serendipitous encounter. Armed with knowledge about a person’s passions, needs, or interests, you can do more than connect; you’ll have an opportunity to bond and impress. I never shy away from mentioning the research I’ve done. I always make a special effort to inquire about the people I’d like to meet. Inevitably, people are flattered. Wouldn’t you be? Instantly, the other person knows that rather than suffering through a strained half hour with a stranger, they’re able to connect with someone with whom they share an interest, someone who has gone out of his way to get to know them better. I mapped out the most important players in both the online and games industries, from CEOs and journalists to programmers and academics. My goal was to get to know almost all of them within a year. To create excitement around our product, I wrote down a list of people I called “influentials”: the early adopters, journalists, and industry analysts that help spread the initial buzz about a product or service. Next, I made a list of potential customers, potential acquirers, and people who might be interested in funding us down the road. Aspirational contacts: those extremely high-level people who have nothing to do with my business at hand but are just interesting or successful or both. You have to view getting to know new people as a challenge and an opportunity. The very idea should spark your competitive fires, silencing the wallflower in you. Cold calls are for suckers. I don’t call cold - ever. I’ve created strategies that ensure every call I make is a warm one. When I call someone directly whom I haven’t spoken with before, I try to call at an unusual time. Someone who is busy is more likely to pick up their own phone at 8:00 A.M. or 6:30 P.M. Plus, they’re probably less stressed out since they’re not facing typical nine-to-five pressures. I called in the early morning, but got Serge’s voice mail. So I left a message: “I just want to reiterate my excitement regarding our meeting. I’ve never heard John talk so flatteringly of a business associate. I understand how busy you must be. I haven’t heard from your administrative assistant, but I’m sure I will. See you soon.” At no point do you want your interactions to become strained. Creating and maintaining a sense of optimism and gentle pressure around the appointment is all part of the dance. In fifteen seconds, I used my four rules for what I call warm calling: 1) Convey credibility by mentioning a familiar person or institution - in this case, John, Jeff, and WebMD. 2) State your value proposition: Jeff’s new product would help Serge sell his new products. 3) Impart urgency and convenience by being prepared to do whatever it takes whenever it takes to meet the other person on his or her own terms. 4) Be prepared to offer a compromise that secures a definite follow-up at a minimum. That was Ken’s five-minute sales pitch. It was 98 percent value-add for me, 2 percent sales pitch by him. Invisibility is a fate far worse than failure. In building a network, remember: Above all, never, ever disappear. Keep your social and conference and event calendar full. As an up-and-comer, you must work hard to remain visible and active among your ever-budding network of friends and contacts. I don’t clone myself. I clone the event. I’m constantly looking to include others in whatever I’m doing. It’s good for them, good for me, and good for everyone to broaden their circle of friends. If I’m meeting someone whom I don’t know that well, I might invite someone I do know just to make sure the meeting does not become a waste. I’ve never been to a so-called “networking event” in my life. If properly organized, these get-togethers in theory could work. Most, however, are for the desperate and uninformed. The average attendees are often unemployed. I can’t tell you how many valuable clients and contacts I’ve met during a conversation struck up during an in-flight meal. (By the way, this is the only acceptable time to bother your seat mate.) Friendship is created out of the quality of time spent between two people, not the quantity. There is a misconception that to build a bond, two people need to spend a great deal of time together. This is not the case. The follow-up I remember best is the one I got first. “It was a pleasure meeting you. We must keep in touch.” In such an e-mail, I like to cite something particular we talked about in the course of our conversation - whether a shared hobby or business interest - that serves as a mental reminder of who I am. When I leave the meeting, I put the name and e-mail address of the new acquaintance in my database and program my PDA or BlackBerry to remind me in a month’s time to drop the person another e-mail, just to keep in touch. But remember - and this is critical - don’t remind them of what they can do for you, but focus on what you might be able to do for them. It’s about giving them a reason to want to follow up. Setting goals ahead of time is what turns a casual conference attendance into a mission. They provide a forum to meet the kind of like-minded people who can help you fulfill your mission and goals. While others quietly sit taking notes, content to sip their free bottled water, successful connectors are setting up one-on-one meetings, organizing dinners, and, in general, making each conference an opportunity to meet people who could change their life. People are either bowling balls or pins at a conference. If you’re the ball, you walk (or roll) into a conference, event, or an organization, and you blow it apart. With a dash of bravado and ingenuity, you leave a positive impression in your wake, create friendships, and achieve the goals on your agenda. The pins sit placidly by, waiting for something, anything, to happen to them. Help the organizer. Better yet, be the organizer. An opportunity for you to come in and help out - and become an insider in the process. Once you’re on the inside, you can find out who will be attending and what the hot events will be. And you’ll find yourself at all those unlisted dinners and cocktail parties that are thrown for the conference poobahs. How powerful it was to know, in advance, who would be attending. Giving speeches is one of the easiest and most effective ways to get yourself, your business, and your ideas seen, heard of, and remembered. There are thousands of forums and events going on - for every imaginable reason - each and every day. All these forums need a warm body to say something the slightest bit inspiring or insightful to their guests. Most speakers, unfortunately, deliver neither. If you take the first step and get to know the organizer, landing a speaking gig isn’t that tough. Before the event, I’ll scout out a nice nearby restaurant and send out pre-invites to a private dinner that I’ll host alongside the scheduled affair. Sending a fax to the hotel (most conferences have one host hotel where most VIPs will be staying) that the individuals get when they arrive the night before the conference asking them to join a group for dinner or drinks that night. Think about it: no secretaries to screen the message. As with college, everyone likes to get off campus. If the conference is in your hometown, be bold enough to invite people to your home for a real treat. You must remember to talk with speakers before they’ve hit the stage. The two minutes you’re given with someone you’re “bumping into” whom you are looking to meet. Your goal should be to leave the encounter with an invitation to reconnect at a later time. The bump, like other practices, is nuanced. The perfect bump is one that feels both fast and meaningful at the same time. I call this ideal a “deep bump.” Deep bumps are an effort to quickly make contact, establish enough of a connection to secure the next meeting, and move on. Creating a connection between any two people necessitates a certain level of intimacy. In two minutes, you need to look deeply into the other person’s eyes and heart, listen intently, ask questions that go beyond just business, and reveal a little about yourself in a way that introduces some vulnerability (yes, vulnerability; it’s contagious!) into the interaction. All these things come together to create a genuine connection. I never once heard Clinton ask for a vote or talk about himself when engaged in these quick, casual encounters. His questions always revolved around what the other person was thinking, what was troubling them. You have to get people to like you first. The sales come later - in the follow-up discussions you have after the conference. Now is the time to begin to build trust and a relationship. Determine where most people will gather, or at least pass, and station yourself there. This might be near the food table, the bar, or the reception area. Your weak ties, on the other hand, generally occupy a very different world than you do. They’re hanging out with different people, often in different worlds, with access to a whole inventory of knowledge and information unavailable to you and your close friends. When in a new city, I generally ask people to give me a list of a few of the hottest (and most established) restaurants. I like to call ahead and ask to speak with the owner (though the maître d’ will do) and tell them that I go out regularly, sometimes in large parties, and I’m looking for a new place to entertain, a lot! Once you get to know the owner, it’ll become like your very own restaurant. Journalists are powerful (the right exposure can make a company or turn a nobody into a somebody), needy (they’re always looking for a story), and relatively unknown (few have achieved enough celebrity to make them inaccessible). If you are sharing someone else’s circle of friends, be sure that you adequately acknowledge the person who ushered you into this new world, and do so in all the subsequent connections that they helped foster. Small talk - the kind that happens between two people who don’t know each other - is the most important talk we do. So what should your objective be in making small talk? Good question. The goal is simple: Start a conversation, keep it going, create a bond, and leave with the other person thinking, “I dig that person.” When it comes to making an impression, differentiation is the name of the game. Confound expectation. Shake it up. How? There’s one guaranteed way to stand out in the professional world: Be yourself. I believe that vulnerability - yes, vulnerability - is one of the most underappreciated assets in business today. Not many secrets are worth the energy required to keep them secret. Be honest, open, and vulnerable enough to genuinely allow other people into your life so that they can be vulnerable in return. Every conversation you have is an invitation to risk revealing the real you. There are always fail-safe conversation starters suitable for every business function: How did you get started in your business? What do you enjoy most about your profession? Tell me about some of the challenges of your job? But safety - whether in conversation, business, or life - generally produces “safe” (read: boring) results. Maintain a good balance of eye contact. If you maintain an unblinking stare 100 percent of the time, that qualifies as leering. That’s plain scary. If you keep eye contact less than 70 percent of the time, you’ll seem disinterested and rude. Somewhere in between is the balance you’re looking for. In conducting small talk, we should be aware of the different styles at play and adapt to the person we’re talking with. I know I can be gregarious and fun and outspoken when meeting with my staff staff. In a meeting with my loyalty-management strategy consultants, who are much more analytical, I ratchet down the excitement and focus on being more deliberate and precise. If we address someone with the wrong style, the window may close shut with nothing revealed. No connection is made. Throughout my day, I come into contact with hundreds of different people, each with their own distinct communication style. The concept of the Johari Window has helped me become conscious of my need to adapt my conversational approach to each person I want to connect with. One helpful technique I use is to try and envision myself as a mirror to the person with whom I’m speaking. What’s the cadence of their speech? How loudly do they talk? What’s their body language? By adjusting your behavior to mirror the person you are talking to, he’ll automatically feel more comfortable. In order to establish a lasting connection, small talk needs to end on an invitation to continue the relationship. Take the initiative and be the first person to say hello. This demonstrates confidence and immediately shows your interest in the other person. When the conversation starts, don’t interrupt. Try to find out what motivations drive that person. It often comes down to one of three things: making money, finding love, or changing the world. The only way to get people to do anything is to recognize their importance and thereby make them feel important. Every person’s deepest lifelong desire is to be significant and to be recognized. Helping someone accomplish his or her deepest desires is critical not only to forming a bond with someone but to keeping that bond strong and growing. When you help someone through a health issue, positively impact someone’s personal wealth, or take a sincere interest in their children, you engender life-bonding loyalty. The necessities of subsistence, security, and sex. It is within this lower group - where health, wealth, and children reside - where loyalty is created. In addressing those three fundamental issues, you accomplish two things: 1) You help someone fulfill those needs they most need met 2) You allow them the opportunity to move up the pyramid of needs to tackle some of their higher desires. Stop driving yourself - and everyone else - crazy thinking about how to make yourself successful. Start thinking about how you’re going to make everyone around you successful. 80 percent of building and maintaining relationships is just staying in touch. I call it “pinging.” It’s a quick, casual greeting. If you want to transform a contact into a friend, you need a minimum of two face-to-face meetings out of the office. You need to nurture a developing relationship with a phone call or e-mail at least once a month. Anyone who can add a little electricity to your dinner party is an anchor tenant. Journalists, I’ve found, are terrific anchor guests. Six to ten guests, I’ve found, is the optimal number to invite to a dinner. When someone says they cannot come because of another dinner or engagement, I often suggest they come before the dinner for drinks and appetizers, or even after, for dessert and drinks. Thursdays are wonderful days for dinner parties. It doesn’t cut into people’s weekend plans and yet folks are willing to go a little late knowing that they have only one day left in the work week. Get your invites out early - at least a month in advance. Candles, flowers, dim lighting, and music set a good mood. Always underdress just so no one else feels they did. Don’t seat couples together. You need a well-thought-out point of view. Know what you have that most others do not. It’s your differentiation. It’s your expertise. Creativity in business is often nothing more than making connections that everyone else has almost thought of. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel, just attach it to a new wagon. Once a resonating pitch is perfected, getting attention is less of a problem. Journalists are hungry for ideas. Getting access to them is often as simple as calling the magazine or newspaper they work for, which can be found on their Web site, and asking to speak with the reporter that covers your beat. I’d latch on to the latest, most cutting-edge idea in the business world. I’d immerse myself in it, getting to know all the thought leaders pushing the idea and all the literature available. I’d then distill that into a message about the idea’s broader impact to others and how it could be applied in the industry I worked in. That was the content. Becoming an expert was the easy part. I simply did what experts do: I taught, wrote, and spoke about my expertise. I only really became an expert once I started trying to teach Starting today, you’ve got to figure out what exceptional expertise you’re going to master that will provide real value Identify the people in your industries who always seem to be out in front, and use all the relationship skills you’ve acquired to connect with them. Take them to lunch. Read their newsletters. In fact, read everything you can. Online, there are hundreds of individuals distilling information, analyzing it, and making prognostications. These armchair analysts are the eyes and ears of innovation. You have to start today building relationships with the media before you have a story you’d like them to write. Send them information. Meet them for coffee. Call regularly to stay in touch. Give them inside scoops on your industry. Establish yourself as a willing and accessible source of information, and offer to be interviewed for print, radio, or TV. Rather than listen more closely to his angle, I tried to impress upon him what I thought the real story was about. Big mistake! If a reporter calls you, states his story and the angle he’s taking, you can be sure you’ll be used as an example to buttress his angle. Rare is the occasion that a journalist will hear you out and say, “Oh my God, you’re right! I’m going about it all wrong.” As in any interview, your primary objective when you meet with a member of the press is to get the person across from you to like you. The reporter is human. What’s an editor going to say when you pitch him or her an idea? Probably something like “Sure, sounds great. Very busy. Gotta go. Let me see it when it’s done.” This is how editors talk and this is what they invariably say. But now, when you call others to interview them, you’re not just Joe Shmo, you’re Joe Shmo calling about an article targeted for the Poughkeepsie Gazette. A lion, he says, can use his prodigious hunting skills to capture a field mouse with relative ease anytime he wants, but at the end of the day, no matter how many mice he’s ensnared, he’ll still be starving. The more accomplished the people we associate with, the greater our aspirations become. Trust is the essential element of mixing with powerful and famous people - trust that you’ll be discreet; trust that you have no ulterior motives behind your approach; trust that you’ll deal with them as people and not as stars; and basically trust that you feel like a peer who deserves to be engaged as such. The first few moments of an encounter is the litmus test for such a person to size up whether he or she can trust you in these ways or not. They often fret over the fact that their public persona becomes indistinguishable from their private personality. They feel misunderstood and underappreciated for who they really are. To assure them that you’re interested in them for themselves, rather than what the public perceives them to be, stay away from their fame and focus, instead, on their interests. Take them away from what they are normally barraged with. Find Mentors, Find Mentees, Repeat. When you’re out of balance, you’ll know because you’ll be rushed, angry, and unfulfilled. When you’re balanced, you’ll be joyful, enthusiastic, and full of gratitude. Refrigerator Rights: How many people can walk into our homes and just open up the fridge and help themselves?","A good book that's mostly about networking, but also some general business smarts. Definitely read if you need more work being social."
What Would Google Do?,Jeff Jarvis,0061709719,4,"THE RULES: The mass market is dead, replaced by the mass of niches. We have shifted from an economy based on scarcity to one based on abundance. The control of products or distribution will no longer guarantee a premium and a profit. Enabling customers to collaborate with you - in creating, distributing, marketing, and supporting products - is what creates a premium in today's market. The most successful enterprises today are networks - which extract as little value as possible so they can grow as big as possible - and the platforms on which those networks are built. Owning pipelines, people, products, or even intellectual property is no longer the key to success. Openness is. Yahoo and AOL are already has-beens. They operate under the old rules. They control content and distribution and think they can own customers, relationships, and attention. They create destinations and have the hubris to think customers should come to them. They spend a huge portion of their revenue on marketing to get those people there and work hard to keep them there. Give the people control, and we will use it. Don't, and you will lose us. That is the essential rule. As a business owner, respond to people. Don't rely on an intern or PR company to make the search and contact. Do it yourself. Be yourself. Find someone who has a problem. Find out more about the problem by engaging in conversation. Solve it. Learn from it. Then tell people what you learned. You might have had such exchanges over the years via letters, phone calls, and underlings. But now the conversation will occur in public, as will your education. As with free speech itself, what we say isn't as important as the system that enables us to say it. That system requires that everything about you, your product, your business, and your message, has a place online with a permanent address so people can search and find you, then point to you, respond to you, and even distribute what you have to say. DO WHAT YOU DO BEST AND LINK TO THE REST: Do what you do best and link to the rest. The link forces specialization. The specialization fosters collaboration. Specialization creates a demand for quality. Explosive web companies don't charge what the market will bear - they charge as little as they can bear. Today's ""Web 2.0"" method for growth is to forgo paying for marketing and instead create something so great that users distribute it. Networks are built atop platforms. A platform enables. It helps build value. If it is open and collaborative, those users may in turn add value to the platforms. Facebook didn't translate its own Spanish and German versions: it created a platform for translation and handed the task to its users, who did the work for free. USERS: ""Can I use your platform to build my own business?"" The correct answer is yes. How can you act as a platform? What can others build on top of it? How can you add value? How little value can you extract? How big can the network atop your platform grow? How can the platform get better learning from users? How can you create open standards so even competitors will use and contribute to the network, and you get a share of the value? NEW PUBLICNESS: Monitor search queries. If users are asking questions, write articles with those answers. Keeping an eye on search terms is a preemptive reader survey. Publicness is a key attribute of successful business. We now live and do business is glass houses (and offices). Take actions in public so people can see what you do and react to it, make suggestions, and tell their friends. Customer service is the new marketing. ELEGANT ORGANIZATION: You don't start communities. Communities already exist. They're already doing what they want to do. The question you should ask is how you can help them do that better. Bring them elegant organization. The key to all platforms is to enable others to use the tool as they wish. Look at the communities around you. Have you enabled them... to talk? to share what they know and need to know? to support each other? to do business together? to socialize? Be careful. Don't assume these people care about you or think of themselves as members of your community. Don't think that you can create a community. They're not yours. NEW ECONOMY: Umar Haque's bubblegeneration.com blog has influenced Chris Anderson and me. He says media 2.0's three sources of value creation are: - revelation (finding the good stuff) - aggregation (distribution 2.0) - plasticity (enabling content to be extended like mashups) Release information bottlenecks and make things more liquid. Stop trying to make money by interfering in transactions. What if your goods cost you nothing? What if you charged nothing? Where does your value exist? What is the essence of your business? What can you learn from it? How do you make money - is there a side door? The internet is a great big race to free. Anyone who has built a business model with a price above free for something that can be free is in a tough strategic position. So how do you get to free first? NEW ATTITUDE: The more you control, the less you will be trusted. The more you hand over control, the more trust you will earn. The powerful must learn to trust the public. We still need editors, curators, teachers to find and nurture the best. Traditionalists suggest we throw out the internet baby with the bathwater. One nasty comment, one hoax, and they try to use that to discredit the entirety of a service as a whole. Corrections enhance credibility. Standing up and admitting your errors makes you more believable. It gives your audience faith that you will right your future wrongs. The worst mistake is to act as if you don't make mistakes. Blog about your plans and decisions. Join in human conversations with customers. Ask people what you should do. Your competitive advantage is not that your designs are secret, but that you have a strong relationship with your community of customers. Companies should be meritocracies. Speed is a strategic necessity. Adjust to customers' actions and desires quickly. Learn from them and stay ahead of them. Holding back products and popping them out as surprises insults your customers (unless you're Apple). The earlier they're involved with the process, the better. Beware any strategy built on protection from cannibalization, for it probably means the cannibals are at the door and ready to eat you for lunch. Cash flow can blind you to the strategic necessity of change, though decisions, and innovation. Approach innovation in that order: first find the problem, then create the solution. Beware the cool idea. Design is about more than aesthetics. Design is an ethic. Design is the path by which you interact with your public. Magazines, clothes, and cars aren't the only things that are designed. Companies are designed. Services are designed. Rules are designed. The simpler and clearer the design, the better. To be simple is to be direct. To be direct is to be honest. If you make a great platform, the worst thing you could do is to put yourself in the middle, getting in the way of what people want to do with it. Make something useful. Help people use it. Then get out of the way. NEWSPAPERS: Decide what business you're in. A huge new business of being analog in a digital world: like therapy. What if papers handed over much of their work to Google? Why not outsource distribution, technology, and a good share of ad sales to Google as a platform so the paper can concentrate on its real job: Journalism. In the link economy, it no longer pays to sell copies of content when the original is just a link and a click away. The link economy makes five demands: - produce unique content with clear value - open up so the world can find you - when you get links and audience, exploit them (often through advertising) - use links to find new efficiencies (Do what you do best & link to the rest.) - create value atop this link layer: curation, infrastructure, advertising networks. See how the world is disrupted and find opportunity in it. The best way to exploit the legacy value of a paper is to use its old-media megaphone to promote and build what comes next. Cannibalize thyself. Convincing your audience to move to the future is better than following them there after they have discovered other sources of news. What doesn't the public assign us? Gather assignments. This turns the relationship between journalist and public on its head. The public is now the boss. Reaching deeper into communities, having more of an impact, and adding more value. Revision3 TV: inviting viewers to submit their own pilots. ADVERTISING: Marketers' ultimate goal should be to eliminate advertising by improving their products and relationships instead. (This is an unreachable Nirvana, but a good goal.) Google - and Apple - make money by giving a key part of their business away for free, then making money on something else. Too often, companies think that everything they do has value they must capture, charge for, monetize, preserve, restrict, and protect. Instead, the real value may come from the side. Invest effort in social tools that enable customers to tell you what you should be producing. Hand over as much control to them as you can. Advertising is supposed to tell us about a product or its price so we can save effort, time, and money in our search for it. Doesn't the internet itself replace advertising? Often, yes. The fundamental message of marketing must change from ""we want your money"" to ""we share your interests"". Companies should buy ads on relevant blogs, as a way to underwrite blogs, as they would a PBS show. Share the interests and affections of the blog's readers. RETAIL: Imagine a restaurant run on openness and data. The menu shows exactly how many people had ordered each dish. Survey diners at the end of the meal. The more layers of data you have, the more you learn, the more useful your advice can be. You could show what dishes are popular with runners! Open-source the restaurant. Put recipes online, and invite the public to make suggestions. MANUFACTURING: See Threadless, CafePress.com, Zazzle, Threadbanger, BurdaStyle.com REAL ESTATE: If you must explain your value, it's not as great as you think. I'd start a company that does nothing but help market homes in the open internet, creating listings on Craigslist, taking pictures and making videos, making web pages for the homes, making sure those pages show up in searches, even buying ads on Google. You can do this for free using Picasa, YouTube, Google Maps aerial view, and lists of local restaurants using Yelp. Home sellers can add links to their own favorite hangouts, best grocery stores, and add tips about where the kids can play. You can sell not just the property but the experience, the lifestyle, the community. It won't be long before you can introduce buyers to our neighbors, linking to their blogs or Facebook. Many homeowners wouldn't want to do this themselves, so there's a business opportunity to help. I'd sell these services and options for flat fees, not a percentage of sale price. Start a company that offers concierge services to schedule and escort would-be buyers. Buyers could pay the consierge to chauffeur them from home to home. Sellers could pay the consierge to hold open-houses (& make the place presentable). See lcoal home-tour bloggers emerge, taking tours, taking pictures, and treating new homes on the market as news. I'd read it and buy ads there. EveryBlock.com lists all kinds of data around addresses. Outside.in organizes local blog posts around locations. CleverCommute provides a real picture of traffic headaches. All this open data beats the agent telling you that every neighborhood is wonderful and every house has potential. MONEY: See Fred Wilson, partner at Union Square Ventures in NYC: His blog is avc.com Venture capital's goal is to find talented people with good ideas, and to give them the resources they need to execute those ideas. If I were a venture capitalist I'd figure out how to build a platform for entrepreneurship. Consider being a matchmaker connecting investors and start-ups directly, trying not to get too much in the way. Learning from lots of data is the pillar of Google-think. HEALTH: see PatientsLikeMe.com Decentralized. Self-organized. Not just DIY, but DIO (Do It Ourselves). EDUCATION: When we embark on learning, we often don't know what we don't know. The teacher still has a role and value: to craft a syllabus to guide your understanding. When it's clear what you want to learn, it's possible for a student to use books, videos, or experimentation to teach himself. TeachStreet.com connects teachers with students. We join to learn and teach together, sometimes handling the teaching duties to the best student on a given subject. Peer-to-peer education works well online as we can see in language-learning services such as Livemocha.com where teachers in one language become students in another, and where anyone in its gift economy can critique and help any student. It's a learning network. See The Berlin School of Creative Leadership (where I serve on the advisory board). PR and LAWYERS: hopeless. PR: They can't be transparent. They have clients. It should be the job of PR advisers to convince clients that it's in their interest to be transparent and honest. PR turned upside-down: rather than representing and spinning the client to the world, they remind the client that the world is watching. Help get companies into this groove. Volunteers could publish simple, clear, and free explanations of laws and legal documents online. All it takes is one generous lawyer to ruin the game for a thousand of them. GENERATION G: What is the internet, then? Libertarian? The internet champions and enables personal liberty. The internet not as left, right, or libertarian bus as the connection machine that brings together any and all worldviews. The internet doesn't make us more creative. Instead, it enables what we create to be seen, heard, and used. It enables every creator to find a public. That takes creation out of the proprietary hands of the supposed creative class. Curmudgeons argue that they rob the creative class of its financial support and exclusivity: its pedestal. The internet lets us find people who like what we do. The internet kills the mass: mass economics and mass media. Curmudgeons argue that it's flooded with crap. Only the playing field is flat. To stand out, one must rise on worth - as is defined by the public, rather than the priests - and the reward is attention. We want to create and we want to be generous with our creations. We will get the attention we deserve. That means crap will be ignored. It just depends on your definition of crap.","Great think-piece about lessons learned from Google's approach to things, and how they might approach different industries like airlines, real estate, education, etc."
Speaking of India,Craig Sorti,1931930341,4,"India is no more a country than is the equator. ""Whatever you can say rightly about India, the opposite is also true."" We assume, unaware, that our culture is the best, normal, right. The development of this belief in our own culture is an important part of our ability to function effectively in it. Causing someone to lose face: - openly disagreeing with what someone says, especially if senior - correcting what someone has said, especially if senior - criticizing someone present - challenging something someone says - giving negative feedback - not being able to answer a question one should know the answer to - not being prepared in circumstances where you should be - saying something is not possible - admitting a mistake - admitting you don't know - admitting you're not on schedule, falling behind. - asking for help or more time The primary reason for communication in India is not an exchange of information, but to preserve harmony and avoid giving offense, thereby safeguarding and strengthening the bond between speakers. Any exchange of information that happens is welcome and appropriate, but not the main point. In Western culture, (viewed by an Indian), indepepdence is viewed as the cherished ideal and dependence is seen as a stigma. In contrast the Eastern cultures place more emphasis on dependability. Parents ensure children grow up in an atmosphere where the parents are the role model of dependability. Such goals lead to indulgence and prolonged babyhood. But it creates strong bonds and provides an inner sense of security and strength. 1991 Hofstede survey of individualism: US 91 AU 90 UK 89 NL 80 CA 80 NZ 79 DK 74 SE 71 NO 69 CH 68 DE 67 FI 63 IN 48 Average is 42. Guatemala was 6. When used as the initial response to something a Westerner says, ""yes"" should be seen for what it is : pure politeness and nothing more. (Like we might say ""hm"" or ""uh huh"".) Indians avoid saying ""no"". Instead, they do it by not giving a real yes. Absense of a positive statement where ""yes"" is clearly desired or expected. These things mean NO: - responding with a question - won't answer your question - hesitate - qualified yes (""maybe"" or ""should be possible"") - postponing (""let me ask my team"") - saying how busy they are - agreeing at first, but then asking about it again later These are ASKING FOR HELP: - saying how busy they are - saying something is taking longer than expected - implying a deadline might be missed (you are supposed to ask why) - something is more complicated than they thought - talking about another team that recently needed and received help - talking about a time when they received help in the past These are NEGATIVE CRITICISM ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL: - avoiding any response - repeating your suggestion - a loud silence - suggesting an alternative - asking your opinion of your own idea - only praising part of it When Indians have a request to make, and not sure if the other person can agree to it (that the other person might need to say no) - they never actually make the request. Instead they make it clear through comments and observations that they could use some help if the other person was so inclined, then wait to see how the other person resopnds. If the person is willing to help, they will offer it. If they are unable or not willing, they will say nothing. This avoids the awkward position of having to turn down the ""request"" because no request was ever made. If you want Indians to be more direct, you have to tell them several times, and give them time to get used to being what they regard as impolite. Give strong feedback as soon as you see the least sign of Indians doing what you've asked. Don't telegraph the answer you want. They will say what they think you want to hear. Don't say, ""That won't take long, will it?"" or ""Can you get it done by Friday?"" If you really want to know what they think, don't begin by telling them what you think. ""In America, it is easier to talk about money or sex than about power. People who have it deny it. People who want it do not want to appear too hungry for it. People who engage in its machinations do so secretly."" - (Kanter) Bosses do not empower subbordinates. They are expected to check-in constantly to get the boss's OK. Subbordinates should never act empowered. When talking to a team, you must talk to the boss, not the subbordinates. If you want a team to NOT consult you for everything: 1. tell them you want them to take responsibility and not check with you 2. explain why : that you find it inefficient and a poor use of your time 3. reassure them that even though what you're asking would feel uncomfortable in their culture, it's OK in yours 4. repeat the advice a number of times 5. give them time to practice 6. immediate positive feedback To get beyond the ""doing only what's told"": 1. encourage them to apply the instructions to an entire category of things, not only what's said 2. encourage them to be more direct in questioning innaccurate or wrong instructions 3. encourage them to be more direct in suggesting a better way of doing something The more guidance, the better. Explicit, detailed, specific instructions. Indians don't admit when they don't understand, because saying they don't understand would be like saying the person giving instruction did a bad job. So, when done, say, ""What would you like me to explain again?"" Addressing questions or remarks directly to subordinates is likely to be seen by Indians as an attempt to circumvent the chain of command. Everything must go through the manager/supervisor. Praise the team, not the individual. They regard themselves as family, collaborating, not competing. Praising one subordinate in front of the others is an insult to the rest of the group, and an embarrassment for the person singled out. BEST PRACTICES : MANAGEMENT STYLE: - Encourage Indians to use their own judgement and make their own decisions in areas you have delegated to them. They do not always have to check with you before acting. - Encourage Indians to approach your subordinates directly about matters you have authorized them to handle. Indians do not have to approach your subordinates through you. - Encourage Indians to question instructions they think are inaccurate or wrong, and praise them when they do. - Encourage Indians to speak up if they know a better way to do something. - Explain to Indians that you regard them as your equals in the relationship, not just hired hands. That you are relying on them to act as expert consultants. - Explain to Indians that you fully expect them to ask questions if they have not understood you. - Instead of asking Indians if they have understood you, volunteer additional clarification and see if they accept it. - Encourage your Indian subordinates to speak up at meetings whenever they have something to say. - Try to praise the whole team, not just one individual. - Don't be surprised when younger Indians can be very Western in their behavior one moment, and very Indian the next. In conversation : Indians are waiting for Westerners to interrupt them in the customary places, and when Westerners don't - (because to interrupt is rude in West) - the Indian assumes the Westerner has nothing to say, and keeps on talking. Because of the expected overlap, Indians tend never to put anything important at the beginning of their remarks, because the other person isn't listening. They begin with ritual comments and then, when the other speaker has finished, and is paying attention, move on to the substance of their message. MEETINGS : Indians meet not so much to discuss and deliberate, but to present the results of their discussions and deliberations. Weaker relationships, such as virtual ones, buckle more quickly under the strain of cultural misundertstandings, and collapse much sooner when the going gets tough. What creates trust? - we know the person from extensive interaction - the person is technically competent - the person is reliable, follows-through and does what they say they are going to do - the person gives you honest feedback, including correcting you when you're mistaken - the person admits mistakes - the person admits when he/she doesn't know or understand something - the person is not afraid or too proud to ask for help Pursue opportunities for virtual interacting: - hold more virtual meetings that everyone attends - make sure people identify themselves when they talk on a conference call - use video-conferencing - encourage team members to contact each other by phone, not email. - create a website where you post pictures and personal information about team members","Required reading for anyone doing business in India, with detailed analysis of cultural and communication differences. Example: in India a lack of emphatic “yes!” means “no”. Teaches Westerners to adapt to this."
Richard Branson,ing My Virginity,0812932293,4,"Above all, you want to create something you're proud of. This has always been my philosophy of business. I can honestly say that I have never gone into any business purely to make money. If that is the sole motive, then I believe you are better off not doing it. A business has to be involving, it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts. (When selling Student:) I made the mistake of telling them all about my future plans. Fantasizing about the future is one of my favorite pasttimes. [other plans for Student:] I felt that students were given a raw deal from banks, and I wanted to set up a cheap student bank. I wanted to set up a string of nightclubs and hotels where students could stay, perhaps even offer them good travel, like student trains or a student airline. [This is when he was 20 years old.] (1970:) I knew very little about the record industry, but from what I saw at the record shop, I could see that it was a wonderfully informal business with no strict rules. It had unlimited potential for growth : a new band could suddenly sweep the nation and be a huge hit. The music business is a strange combination of real and intangible assets: pop bands are brand names in themselves, and at a given stage in their careers they can practically guarantee hit records. But it is also an industry where the few successful bands are exceptionally rich and the bulk of the bands remain obscure and impoverished. The rock business is a prime example of the most ruthless kind of capitalism. I imagined that the best environment for making records would be a big, comfortable house in the country where a band could come and stay for weeks at a time and record whenever they felt like it. So during 1971 I started looking for a country house that I could convert into a recording studio. [They drove around and looked at ads and found a 15-bedroom manor for £35k but agreed to £30k because it had been on the market a while. He had no money himself but borrowd some from the family and showed the bank his business receipts, and got a loan.] I have never enjoyed being accountable to anyone else or being out of control of my own destiny. I have always enjoyed breaking the rules, whether they were school rules or more general rules such as the idea that no 17-year-old can edit a national magazine. As a 20-year old I had lived life entirely on my own terms, following my instincts. [When Virgin took off, with Tubular Bells, they had two options to grow: one would be paid up-front by another company who would distribute it and keep most of the profits. The other was more risky: forego up-front payment and royalties, and just pay another label to manufacture and distribute. Carry all the risk but have all the upside. That's what they chose.] Part of the secret of running a record label was to build up a great sense of momentum, to keep signing new bands, and keep breaking them into the big time. Even if a high-profile band lost us money, there would be other intangible benefits, such as attracting others to sign with us or opening doors to radio stations for our newer bands. I have always believed that the only way to cope with a cash crisis is not to contract but to try to expand out of it. I normally make up my mind about whether I can trust somebody within 60 seconds of meeting them. Necker Island - price was £3 million : Joan and I were determined to buy Necker. I found out the owner wanted to sell in a hurry. He wanted to build something in Scotland that would cost him £200k. I upped my offer to £175k and held on for 3 months. Finally I got a call saying, ""If you offer £180k, it's yours."" The government required he build a resort within 5 years. I was determined to make the money to be able to afford it. Travellers stranded trying to get to Puerto Rico after a cancelled flight. I made a few calls to charter companies and agreed to charter a plane to PR for $2k. Divided the price by the number of seats and wrote, ""Virgin Airways, $39 single flight to Puerto Rico."" Walked around the terminal and soon filled every seat on the charter plane. Whenever Virgin has money, I always renew my search for new opportunities. I am always trying to broaden the group so that we are not dependent upon a narrow source of income, but I suspect that this is due more to inquisitiveness and restlessness than sound financial sense. (When ""Event"" magazine failed:) I realized how important it was to separate the various Virgin companies so that if one failed, it would not threaten the rest of the Virgin group. (When Virgin Records was doing well:) As I watched the money pour into the bank, I began to think of other ways to use it. I needed another challenge. I had the opportunity to use our cash to set up more Virgin companies and widen the basis of the group so that all our eggs would not be in one basket if we were hit by another recession. I also wanted to expand the Virgin name to stand for more than a record label and become more widely involved in all kinds of media. I had cash mounting up in the bank, and I wanted to reinvest it as fast as possible. I make up my mind about a business proposal within 30 seconds and whether it excites me. I rely far more on gut instinct than researching huge amounts of statistics. I feel numbers can be twisted to prove anything. I found the press enjoyed writing stories about Virgin if they could put a face to the name. For the first time I began to use myself to promote the companies and the brand. Apart from never involving my family, I was happy to do anything to increase Virgin's profile: promotion was one of the keys to our growth. (About CD-burning machines:) I was determined that this example of vertical integration would work in the same way as the integration between owning a recording studio, a record label, and record shops had worked. I have a weakness for vertical integration, which I admit does not always work. (Mistakes: CD factory, bought a pub because so many Virgin staff went there. Almost bought a property maintenance company because they had so many properties that needed repair.) We reverted to our old (and current) way of doing business : minimize the amount of cash we have tied up in fixed assets and buy services from the most efficient supplier. Whenever anyone tells me that I've got no option, I try to prove them wrong. Since 1993, we've had the luxury of money and a strong brand name that could be lent to a wide variety of businesses. I could have retired, but this was fun. Fun is at the core of how I like to do business, and it has informed everything I've done from the outset. More than any other element, fun is the secret of Virgin's success. I'm often asked to define my business philsophy, but I don't believe that it can be taught as if it's a recipe. There aren't ingredients and techniques that will guarantee success. Parameters exist that, if followed, will ensure that a business can continue, but it's not as if you can clearly define our business succes and then bottle it as if it's a perfume. It's not that simple. To be successful, you have to be out there, you have to hit the ground running, and if you have a good team around you and more than a fair share of luck, you might make something happen. Virgin has made money, but I have always invested it in new projects to keep the company growing. As a result, we rarely had the luxury of spare cash to use as a cushion. My vision for Virgin has never been rigid, and changes constantly, like the company itself. I have always lived my life by making lists : lists of people to call, lists of ideas, lists of companies to set up, lists of people who can make things happen. Each day I work through these lists, and that sequence of calls propels me forward. Despite employing over 20,000 people, Virgin is not a big company - it's a big brand made up of lots of small companies. Our priorities are the opposite of most competitors, who worry about shareholders first, customers next, employees last. For us, employees matter most. Start off with a happy well-motivated workforce, you're far more likely to have happy customers. Every time one of our ventures gets too big, we divide it up into smaller units. I go to deputy directors and tell them they're now directors of a new company. The people haven't had much more work to do, but they have a greater incentive to perform and a greater zest for their work. By the time we sold Virgin Music, we had as many as 50 subsidiary record companies, and not one of them had more than 60 employees. Once you have a great product, it's essential to protect its reputation with vigilance. (Monitor the press.) By investing in separate businesses with partners, ""ring-fenced"" as the bankers keep telling me, we had been able to withstand the management pressures of 9/11, spread risk and make what we hope have been a lot of good decisions. Couple those with a venture-capital private-equity model of creating individual companies with their own business cases, shareholders, and financial resources, and you have the Virgin of 2004.",Autobiography of his life from childhood through 2004. Interesting how he was always over-leveraged and how that drove him forward. Amazing how he negotiated Necker Island from £3 million down to £180k.
The Complacent Class,Tyler Cowen,9781250108692,3,"There has been a fundamental shift of societal energy away from building a new and freer world and toward rearranging the pieces in the world we already have. There was something to be said for less-compatible, more challenge-laden accidental pairings with all their conflicts and messy resolutions. At the end of the day, you weren’t quite satisfied with your pairings, and so you felt you had to go away and do or build something great, because you had no notion of just waiting for the next social network–based encounter to come along. The great adventures of life, the surprise of strangers, of strangeness, of the electric and eclectic moments of happenstance, and also of extreme ambition, are slowly being removed by code as a path to a new contentment. Of all the drugs that might have been legalized, American citizens chose the one - marijuana - that makes users spacey, calm, and sleepy. A new city or state forces people to rethink their assumptions about the best ways to do things and about what their lives really should consist of. A move forces individuals to start working with a whole new set of people and business practices; even if this change is not always for the better, the resulting creative ferment will breed change and progress. A dynamic, moving society may be less comfortable personally, but it is likely to be more innovative. Just contemplating the prospect of a move can force people to start reexamining how they are spending their time, their future job plans, and who the friends they really can count on are. Countersignaling is when you go out of your way to show you don’t need to go out of your way. The boss doesn’t have to wear a tie or even dress up. If he did, that would suggest he had something to prove, which would be a negative rather than a positive impression. A culture of the casual is a culture of people who already have achieved something and who already can prove it. In an art gallery or some other high-end retail outlet, the dealers and directors know that very often the biggest spenders walk in the door wearing jeans and sneakers. Those who show up in the suit and tie are less likely to drop $10 million on a Basquiat, as the choice of formal garb signals they still have something to prove. Since the 1960s, the cultures that have produced the most upward economic mobility include Japan, South Korea, and China, due to their supercharged rates of economic growth. It is no accident that these are the same cultures obsessed with business cards, stereotypical blue suits, submission to hierarchical authority, and bringing the perfect gift, among other customs. The young and ambitious really can set themselves apart from the slackers. Voters don’t seem impressed by experts anymore, and one even wonders if a lot of people aren’t voting against experts and elites just out of spite or a desire to show them up. The better-run governments in the world tend to be trusted by their people. They can announce what they want to do, be believed, proceed with concrete steps, and at the end of the process be evaluated by voters in a more or less fair way. In contrast, the untrusted governments usually have to resort to subterfuge, lies, and trickery, and that tends to come bundled with corruption, economic distortions, and a general lack of transparency. Rebellion into a vacuum: Lost faith in the system, but without a strong ideology and a strong belief in the future, the vacuum can be filled by other, worse ideas. The biggest story of the last fifteen years, both nationally and globally, is the growing likelihood that a cyclical model of history will be a better predictor than a model of ongoing progress.","America’s dynamic ever-changing past is slowing into a complacent stagnation. People don’t move as much or expect change. This hurts class mobility, and eventually needs to change. Inspired by his visit to China, which has grown 10% every year for 30 years, meaning every 7 years it’s like a whole new country is built. America is relatively halted."
Lying,Sam Harris,1940051002,3,"We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy. To lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication. People lie so that others will form beliefs that are not true. All forms of lying - including white lies meant to spare the feelings of others - are associated with less satisfying relationships. Sincerity, authenticity, integrity, mutual understanding - these and other sources of moral wealth are destroyed the moment we deliberately misrepresent our beliefs. Among the many corrosive effects of unjust laws: They tempt peaceful and (otherwise) honest people to lie so as to avoid being punished for behavior that is ethically blameless. It is hard to abolish lies once they have escaped into the world. We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed. Peaceful, honest people have the right to be left alone. I’d call it “skillful truth-telling” as opposed to “evasion.” When you were doing all these charitable things, did you really care about the people you were doing these things for? When you care, you’ll know what to do.","A tiny booklet, like a long article, about why lying is bad. Not as many insights as I expected."
The Daily Stoic,Ryan Holiday,125113310,3,"Virtue (meaning, self-control, courage, justice, and wisdom) is happiness. Your perceptions of things cause most of your trouble, not the things themselves. Control your perceptions. Accept what’s outside your control. You can only control and rely on your reason to choose how you categorize, respond, and reorient ourselves to external events. Use your will to find the wisdom and perspective to deal with anything. Differentiate between what you can change and what you can’t. Learn because you want to be freer, fear less, and achieve peace. Direct your efforts at a cause or a purpose. Get clarity about who you are and what you stand for. This is what the mind is here to do: * choice to do and think right * refusal of temptation * yearning to be better * repulsion of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true * preparation for what lies ahead * purpose your guiding principle and highest priority * assent to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside your control See everything else as pollution or a corruption. Harmless indulgences become full-blown addictions. Little compulsions chip away at your freedom. Reclaim the freedom to abstain. Use reason to take the crooked, confusing, and overwhelming nature of external events and make them orderly. Don’t eliminate outside influences or run away to quiet and solitude. Serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment. If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility, you will never be successful. Study philosophy to break yourself of rote behavior. Recall the events of the previous day. Notice what contributed to your happiness and what detracted from it. Read carefully. Don’t be satisfied with a rough understanding of the whole. Don’t agree too quickly with those who have a lot to say about something. Limit your action or inaction to only what’s in keeping with the needs of your own preparation. Have a mantra. Look at what the wise run away from, and what they seek out. Keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand. Give up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint. If some regard you as important, distrust yourself. One of the most powerful things you can do as a human being in your hyperconnected, 24/7 media world is say: “I don’t know.” Or, more provocatively: “I don’t care.” The nearer you come to a calm mind, the closer you are to strength. Don’t give way to anger and discontent. Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of yourself. Getting anxious is wanting something outside your control. You can be invincible if you are not upset by anything outside your reasoned choice. Think before you act. Impulses of all kinds are going to come, and your work is to control them, like bringing a dog to heel. Submit every impulse to the claims of justice, and protect your clear conviction in every appearance. Endure a turbulent life, but don’t choose it. Choose to be at peace, rather than at war. The paranoid often destroy themselves quicker than any enemy. Cultivate the power to hold no opinion about a negative thing. Practice the ability of having absolutely no thoughts about something. Act as if you had no idea it ever occurred. Or that you’ve never heard of it before. Let it become irrelevant or nonexistent to you. You have all the reason and intelligence you need. The tough part is deferring to it and using it. Make sure that your mind is in charge, not your emotions, not your immediate physical sensations. As pleasurable as these activities might seem, they ruin your chance at happiness here and now: * anticipating some future event * passionately imagining something you desire * looking forward to some happy scenario You are invincible if you want nothing, because nothing lies outside your control. Speak only when you’re certain that what you’ll say isn’t better left unsaid. Harm comes from your own belief about the abuse, not the abuse itself. If someone sends you an angry email but you never see it, did it actually happen? Situations require your participation in order to be considered “bad”. Seneca was wealthy and famous - yet he was a Stoic. He had many material things yet he was indifferent to them. He enjoyed them while they were there, but he accepted that they might someday disappear. Indifference is solid middle ground. It’s not about avoidance or shunning, but rather not giving any possible outcome more power or preference. The good are virtues. The bad are the vices. The indifferent include wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, and pain. Don’t set your heart on so many things. Focus. Prioritize. You become a philosopher when you exercise your guiding reason and start to question the emotions and beliefs and even language that others take for granted. Even what you get for free has a cost, if only in what you pay to store it - in your garage and in your mind. You hand your mind over willingly to social media, what other people are doing, thinking, or saying. Choose whether to be loved by these friends and remain the same person, or to become a better person at the cost of those friends. You can remove most sins if you have a witness standing by as you are about to go wrong. You should each have your own Cato - a great and noble person you can allow into your minds and use to guide your actions, even when they’re not physically present. The indifferent spectator can stand witness to your behavior. Whenever you find yourself blaming providence, turn it around in your mind and you will see that what has happened is in keeping with reason. All things are guided by reason - but that it is a vast and universal reason that you cannot always see. Notice how often you look for more. If you are wanting the past to be still here, you’re neglecting the present moment. Work can’t overwhelm you. This is impossible. External objects have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel come from the inside, not the outside. What you willingly generate in your mind, that’s on you. You can’t blame other people for making you feel stressed People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or in the mountains. You can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than in your own soul - especially if on close inspection it is filled with ease, which is nothing more than being well-ordered. Treat yourself often to this retreat and be renewed. Study, yes, but go live your life as well. It’s the only way that you’ll actually understand what any of it means. It’s only from your actions and choices that it will be possible to see whether you took any of the teachings to heart. Freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but by removing your desire. Unnecessary things are not worth it at any price. A dog that’s allowed to chase cars will chase cars. A child who is never given any boundaries will become spoiled. An investor without discipline is not an investor - he’s a gambler. A mind that isn’t in control of itself will be jerked around by external events and unquestioned impulses. Put in place training and habits now to replace ignorance and ill discipline. If you shove your feet into tiny shoes each day, your feet begin to take on that form. The same is true for your mind. If you hold a perpetually negative outlook, soon enough everything you encounter will seem negative. Drama, combat, and terror wipe out your sacred principles, whenever your mind entertains them uncritically or lets them slip in. Stop and ask: OK, what do I really want? What am I actually after here? Notice the contradictory and inconsistent wishes Prepare yourself for negativity when you first rise in the morning, because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding. Our inner fortress is impenetrable. Stuff cannot touch the soul. Instead of asking for a way to sleep with her, try asking for a way to stop desiring to sleep with her. Instead of a way to not lose your child, try asking for a way to lose your fear of this. Practice not letting people know who you are - keep your philosophy to yourself for a bit. Fight your biases and preconceptions: because they are a liability. You’re not as smart and as wise as we’d like to think you are. Honor what you do not know, and then set that against the knowledge you actually have. Act on nothing that is untested. Test your impressions. Test whether it belongs to the things in your control or not in your control. And if the latter, be prepared to respond, “It is nothing to me.” Step back and analyze your own senses, question their accuracy, and proceed only with the positive and constructive ones. Sure, it’s tempting to throw discipline and order to the wind and go with what feels right. But if your many youthful regrets are any indication, what feels right right now doesn’t always stand up well over time. Students claim to want to be taught but really secretly believe they already know everything. Who would reject the flood of fortune’s gifts? Anyone who has experienced how easily they flow back. Everything you do has a tax attached to it. For example, the tax on traveling is all the waiting around. Disagreements and occasional frustration are taxes placed on even the happiest of relationships. Theft is a tax on abundance and having things that other people want. Stress and problems are tariffs that come attached to success. Simply pay the taxes in life, and enjoy the fruits of what you get to keep. Do away with the opinion I am harmed, and the harm is cast away too. Do away with being harmed, and harm disappears. Set your mind upon things that are unquestionably good - wisdom, self-control, justice, courage. No one who achieves these quiet virtues experiences buyer’s remorse. When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will get back a grip on it whenever you wish. Instead, bear in mind that because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be necessarily worse. Be a person always stretching to avoid error, by never letting your attention slide. Letting your attention slip and wander builds bad habits and enables mistakes. Use cynical or contemptuous language as a way to dismantle some of the fanciest or most coveted parts of life. It will provide some much-needed objectivity. Feel free to change your mind - that’s what the mind is for. Live from one day to the next. If something strikes you as probable, say it. That is how you remain a free agent. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Turn it inside out and see what it is like - what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself. Situations are easier to understand from different perspectives. Indifference turns the highest power into no power. Looking at the beautiful expanse of the sky is an antidote to the nagging pettiness of earthly concerns. Lose yourself in that as often as you can. Adjust your preconceived notions of the rational and irrational in harmony with nature. Apply the rule of what is in keeping with one’s character. Question our own opinions. The more you subject them to the rigorous test of your education, the more you’ll be your own compass. Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you. If you know what you believe and why you believe it, you’ll avoid poisonous relationships, toxic jobs, fair-weather friends, and any number of ills that afflict people who haven’t thought through their deepest concerns. First tell yourself what kind of person you want to be, what’s important to you, what your priorities are. Then do what you have to do. Work toward that and forsake all the others. If you wish to be beautiful, then work diligently at human excellence. If you want some good, get it from yourself. Where is Good? In your reasoned choices. Where is Evil? In your reasoned choices. Where is that which is neither Good nor Evil? In the things outside of your own reasoned choice. Not whether something is rewarded. Not whether something will succeed. Only whether it is the right choice. The right thing to do always comes from your reasoned choice. Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices. You will only get one shot at today. You have only twenty-four hours with which to take it. And then it is gone and lost forever. Will you fully inhabit all of today? Your ancestors set up those trophies, not that you may gaze at them in wonder, but that you may also imitate the virtues of the men who set them up. Peace of mind is doing nothing wrong. Those who lack self-control live disoriented and disturbed lives. If you want to do something, make a habit of it. Take pleasure in taking the right actions - rather than the results. How you do anything is how you do everything. How you handle today is how you’ll handle every day. Don’t be satisfied with mere learning. Add practice and training. As time passes you forget what you learned. Read the few great books deeply instead of briefly skimming all the new books. Proper human work: * acts of kindness to other human beings * disdain for the stirrings of the senses * identifying trustworthy impressions * contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it. Don’t get upset. Do the right thing. Remember the purpose and principles you value most. Your progress can be impeded or disrupted, but the mind can always be reverted - it retains the power to redirect the path. Whenever talking about people, take a bird’s-eye view and see everything all at once: gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign culture, holidays, memorials, markets - all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites. You can choose whose children you’d like to be. Great people have recorded their wisdom in books. Be the promising children of these noble parents. Focus on doing the smallest things well: practicing with full effort, mastering a specific task. Don’t worry about winning championships, or the opponent’s lead. Build up your life action by action. Be content if each one achieves its goal as far as possible. Every emotion is at first weak. Later it rouses itself and gathers strength as it moves along. It’s easier to slow it down than to supplant it. Rivers are easiest to cross at their source. Instead of, “Tell me what to do!”, a far better request is, “Train my mind to adapt to any circumstance.” Then if circumstances take you off script, you won’t be desperate for new advice. Manage expectations: consider both the best and worst case scenarios. Don’t just think about what you wish to happen, but also what very realistically can happen if things were to suddenly turn. Prepare for that to be exactly what they want to happen - it is an opportunity for excellence and virtue. Thinking of everything that lies ahead is usually counterproductive and overwhelming. Focus exclusively on the present to avoid or remove those intimidating or negative thoughts. Calm is contagious. Ask most people what they’re working toward: become a millionaire? get discovered? become famous? Ask “Why are you doing that?”: want freedom? want happiness? want the respect of their peers? You put immense effort and expense you put into chasing things that are simple and straightforward to acquire. It’s as if you prefer to spend years building a complicated machine instead of just reaching out and picking up what you want. Freedom? That’s easy. It’s in your choices. Happiness? That’s easy. It’s in your choices. All of that is right in front of you. No need to take the long way to get there. Paradoxical intention: If a patient couldn’t sleep, the standard therapy would be relaxation techniques. Frankl instead encouraged the patient to try not to fall asleep. He found that shifting focus off the problem deflected the patient’s obsessive attention away from it and allowed them to eventually sleep normally. CEO of Charles Schwab, when hiring, takes a candidate to breakfast and asks the restaurant’s manager to purposely mess up the candidate’s breakfast order. He’s testing to see how they react. Use negative circumstance as an opportunity to practice an unintended virtue or form of excellence. Never shirk the proper dispatch of your duty. Make the most of your resources to do well the duty at hand. Morality can be complicated - but the right thing is usually clear. Our duty is rarely easy, but it is important. It’s also usually the harder choice. But you must do it. Bring your will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against your will and nothing that you wish for fails to happen. A TO-DO list seems burdensome, but a GET TO DO list sounds like a privilege. Don’t try to impose your will on the world. Instead see yourself as fortunate to receive and respond to the will in the world. Good people will do what they find honorable to do, even if it requires hard work. They won’t do what they find base, even if it brings wealth, pleasure, or power. Nothing will deter them from what is honorable, and nothing will lure them into what is base. Were you made for pleasure? To be coddled or to exert yourself? A good king is from the outset and by necessity a philosopher. Philosophy is essential in his role as a leader and warrior. Leadership offers an unending series of ethical decisions that require priorities, balance, and clarity. Either philosophers should become kings, or those now called kings should truly and sufficiently undertake philosophy. The philosopher is a kingly person. Philosophy cultivates your reason and ethics so that you can do your job well. Don’t just wing it. Love the humble art you have learned, making yourself neither a tyrant nor a slave to any person. Make the time. If you put in the effort, the rest will take care of itself. Love the craft, be a craftsman. Delight in attending to your own improvement, day by day. News can never be relevant to your reasoned choice. Can anyone break news to you that your assumptions or desires are wrong? No. Getting angry is a weakness. Be gentle with those who would obstruct your path or create other difficulties. Forgive them, for they know not what they do. You find yourself thinking, “Why can’t they just do things right?” But not everyone has had the advantages that you’ve had. You had a head start over some people. That’s why it is your duty to understand and be patient with others. No matter what happens today, shift to what lies within your reasoned choices. Ignore the distracting emotions that pop up. Don’t get emotional - get focused. The inexperienced and fearful talk to reassure themselves. The ability to listen, to deliberately keep out of a conversation and subsist without its validity, is rare. Silence is a way to build strength and self-sufficiency. Don’t tell yourself anything more than what the initial impressions report. You hear that someone is speaking badly about you, but not that you’ve been harmed. You hear your son is sick, but not that his life is at risk. Stay within your first impressions. Don’t add to them in your head. Stop, courageously, at the surface. See things in plain, objective form. Strength should not go against strength. Don’t try to beat your opponent where they are strongest. When you try to undertake some impossible task you haven’t bothered to think through. Or you let someone put you on the spot. Or you say yes to everything that comes your way. You are trying to play a losing game. The vast majority of your words and actions are unnecessary. Corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. At each moment, ask if this is one of the unnecessary things. Endless pleasure becomes its own form of punishment. There are plenty of misfortunes one can practice, plenty of problems one can solve in advance. Don’t just think about these things, but live them. Do it now, while things are good. If you are already humble, no one will need to humble you. Proper training can change your default habits. Train yourself to avoid gossip, and you won’t get pulled into it. Train yourself on any habit, and you’ll be able to unconsciously go to that habit in trying times. Being unexpected adds to the weight of a disaster. For that reason, expect anything. In advance, think of all things that could actually happen. Make yourself invulnerable to your dependency on comfort and convenience, or one day your vulnerability might bring you to your knees. Enjoy your relaxation like a poet - not idly but actively, observing the world around you, taking it all in, better understanding your place in the universe. Don’t take a day off from learning. Money doesn’t change people, it just makes them more of who they are. Reflect on what you used to accept as normal. Consider your first paycheck - how big it seemed then. Remember your first apartment. Today, as you’ve become more successful, these conditions would hardly feel sufficient. You probably want even more than what you have right now. Yet just a few years ago those paltry conditions were not only enough, they felt great! When you become successful, you forget how strong you used to be. The work of living is to set standards and then not compromise them. Do good in this particular instance, right now. If you have to preface your remarks with indicators of honesty or directness, what does that say about everything else you say? If you say you’re being honest now, does that mean you usually aren’t? The best revenge is to exact no revenge at all. Even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked. Yet if you’ve ever accidentally stepped on a dog, you know that the first reaction is usually a bark or a yelp or a quick snap of the jaws. In the instant, there is no distinction - just pain. A virtuous person is generous with assumptions: that something was an accident, that someone didn’t know, that it won’t happen again. A wolf should not befriend sheep. You could hope that goodness comes your way - good news, good weather, good luck. Or you could find it within your own thoughts, and make it with your own actions. Philosophy attracts introverts. Each person acquires their own character, but their official roles are designated by chance. Invite some (with other roles) to your table. Philosophy shouldn’t have to accept what time or energy is left over from other occupations. Instead, make time for those other pursuits only once your philosophy study is finished. If real self-improvement is what you’re after, don’t leave your reading until those few minutes before you shut off the lights and go to bed. There is hardly an idea in Stoic philosophy that wouldn’t be immediately agreeable to a child, or that doesn’t jibe with common sense. You were born with an attraction to virtue and self-mastery. If you’ve gotten far from that, it’s from a nurturing of the wrong things and the wrong ideas. Philosophy is a tool to strip it all away - to get back to your true nature. “Amor fati” = a love of fate = not just accepting, but loving everything that happens. “This man has conquered the world! What have you done?” “I have conquered the need to conquer the world.” To have a great empire, rule over yourself. Cease to hope and you will cease to fear. Hope and fear are the same. Both hope and fear contain a dangerous amount of want and worry in them. The want is what causes the worry. Adapting yourself to present circumstances. Don’t send out thoughts too far ahead - projections into the future about things you do not control. Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, not the faults of others. Leave other people to that task for themselves and their own journey. When you experience happiness or wisdom, don’t try to grab that moment and hold on to it with all your might. It’s not under your control how long it lasts. Enjoy it, recognize it, remember it. Having it for a moment is the same as having it forever. Luxury destroys both the body and the soul, causing weakness and incapacity in the body, and lack of control and cowardice in the soul. Luxury breeds injustice because it also breeds greediness. Always shun that which makes you angry. It’s not a sign of weakness to shut it out. Instead, it’s a sign of strong will. Remove this stimulus from your life. What follows is peace and serenity. Postpone nothing. Be like a dying person - as if you’ve come to the very end of life. Balance life’s books each day. The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time. The number of people who stand ready to consume one’s time, to no purpose, is almost countless. No person hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do you hand out your life? You’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time: the one thing about which you should be a miser.","This would be great as a daily email, and I think that's how it was intended.

Leading an Inspired Life,Jim Rohn,1555254594,3,"Discipline is the bridge between thought and accomplishment. All good things are located upstream from us. The passing of time takes us adrift, and drifting only brings us the negative, the disappointment, and the failure. The danger is looking at an undisciplined day and concluding that no great harm has been done. But add up these days to make a lifetime - and it will easily turn your life into a major disaster. How tall will a tree grow? As tall as it can. Everything strives to become all it can possibly be. That surging feeling of self-worth that comes from starting a new discipline - is almost as good as the feeling that comes from the accomplishment the discipline brings. It doesn’t really matter how smart you are if you don’t use your knowledge. Use discipline in applying your knowledge. If we don’t make consistent self-discipline part of our daily lives, the results we seek will be sporadic and elusive. Procrastination is almost the exact opposite of discipline. Discipline then says, “Do it now, to the best of your ability.” An immediate reward for lack of discipline is a fun day at the beach. A future reward of discipline is owning the beach. Life will give you some pretty big challenges, but unless you practice on the small ones and master those, you don’t have a chance on the major ones. A man strides out of his house to go straighten out the corporation, and he has not yet straightened out his garage. Who’s he kidding? So work on all the disciplines, small as well as large, that will improve the quality of your life. You can’t change people. They can change themselves, but you can’t change them. If you want motivated people, you have to find them, not motivate them. Imagine dropping to the floor right now and doing as many push-ups as you possibly can - and let’s say for some reason you haven’t been doing any push-ups lately, so the best you can do is five. But is five all you can ever do? No! If you rest a little, you can do five more. And if you rest a little more, you can do five more. How did we get from five to fifteen? It’s a miracle! If you continue that pattern, is it possible to get up to fifty push-ups? Of course! How do you go from five to fifty? It’s a miracle! It begins with one simple step: doing what you can do. Once you have done that, you can keep working to bring your best to a higher level. Each time you complete an activity and take a rest, you’re preparing yourself for even greater accomplishment. But don’t rest too long. Think of more ways and means to use your own wisdom, your own philosophy. Children require discipline. They must have a structure built for them. They must have boundaries to work within so they feel secure and comfortable to explore and grow. They must learn to recognize what’s right and what’s wrong, what’s acceptable behavior and what’s not acceptable. Children require constant and consistent discipline. Otherwise, they’ll be confused as to how they’re supposed to behave. For every disciplined effort, there are multiple rewards. Learn the discipline of paying attention, or paying your taxes. Learn the discipline of learning all you can learn, of teaching all you can teach, of reading all you can read. A lack of discipline in the small areas of life can cost you heavily in the more important areas of life. You cannot inspire others to sell more when that goal is inconsistent with your own conduct. Nobody would mind paying the price if they could have a clear view of the future. Do two things to help our kids: help them see the promise and help them pay the price. Diminishing Intent. We intend to take action when the idea strikes us. We intend to do something when the emotion is high. But if we don’t translate that intention into action fairly soon, the urgency starts to diminish. The time to act: when the idea is hot and the emotion is strong. Increase your motivation by quickly setting up the disciplines. If you will change yourself, everything else will change for you. You don’t have to change what’s outside, all you’ve got to change is what’s inside. Don’t wish it were easier, wish that you were better. Don’t wish for fewer problems, wish for more skills. It’s amazing how hard-working, intelligent people have all the luck! Work harder on yourself than you do on your job. Doing less than you can messes up the mind the most: causes all kinds of psychic damage. Go where the expectations are so strong that they provoke you, push you. Long-term goals are the equivalent of a major journey. When you reach the point where you’ve achieved your long-term goals, your life will be fundamentally changed, and the process of getting to that point will have transformed you into a stronger, wiser, and higher-performing person. The reason for setting goals is not what you obtain, it'ss what you become along the way. Don’t set your goals too low. Don’t join an “easy” crowd. You won’t grow. Go where the demands are high. Go where the pressure is to perform, to grow. Ambitious people see everything they do - and every discipline they adhere to - as a link in the chain of events and actions that will lead them to their final destination. When you can see that every link in the chain will eventually lead you to the things you want most out of life and to the person you want to become, then you won’t grow discouraged, fearful, or impatient with today. Don’t begin the activities of your day until you know exactly what you plan to accomplish. Don’t start your day until you have it planned. Don’t start your week until you have it planned. “What’s in it for me?” can take you only so far. “What’s in it for somebody besides me?” can take you as far as you need to go. The best money spent is the money spent to cultivate the genius of your own mind and spirit. Don’t spend more for frivolous comforts and conveniences than you do for education. “You have been working now for six years. How are you doing?” I said, “Not very well.” He said, “Then I suggest you not do that anymore. Six years is long enough to operate with the wrong plan.” Hear or read something challenging, something instructional, at least thirty minutes a day, every day. Miss a meal, but not your thirty minutes. I say, “John, I’ve got this gold mine. I’ve got so much gold I don’t know what to do with it all. Come on over and dig.” John says, “I don’t have a shovel.” I say, “Well, John, let’s get you one.” He says, “Don’t you know what they want for shovels these days?” Don’t be casual in getting it. Casualness leads to casualties. Wherever you are, be there! Be there to absorb it. Take a picture if you can. Take pictures in your mind; let your soul and heart take pictures. Get it, capture it, absorb it. Give in to the emotion. Let the feelings strike you. Take a lot of pictures. Don’t be lazy in capturing the event. Reflect means to go back over; to study again. Go back over your notes. Go back over your thoughts. And go back over your day. Long ago: People worked for nine years, and the tenth year was a sabbatical used for relaxing, replenishing, getting in shape physically. Change of pace: go over the previous nine years, to see what went right and what went wrong, what worked well and what didn’t work Gather up today and invest it in tomorrow. Gather up this week and invest it in the next week. Success is one of the best forms of motivation. One person caring for another is life at its best. The road to heaven is heaven.","Great beginning. Absolutely adored the opening of this book, about discipline. Loved it so much it made me jump out of bed and go work for a few hours in the middle of the night, totally inspired. But then the rest of the book was ridiculously generic, with the occasional great sentence. Still, worth getting for that first chapter alone."
The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives,Leonard Mlodinow,9780307275172,3,"We all create our own view of the world and then employ it to filter and process our perceptions, extracting meaning from the ocean of data that washes over us in daily life. The human mind is built to identify for each event a definite cause and can therefore have a hard time accepting the influence of unrelated or random factors. The game has two basic strategies. One is to always guess the color that you notice occurs more frequently. For instance, if green shows up 75 percent of the time and you decide to always guess green, you will be correct 75 percent of the time. The other strategy is to “match” your proportion of green and red guesses to the proportion of green and red you observed in the past. If the greens and reds appear in a pattern and you can figure out the pattern, this strategy enables you to guess right every time. But if the colors appear at random, you would be better off sticking with the first strategy. In the case where green randomly appears 75 percent of the time, the second strategy will lead to the correct guess only about 6 times in 10. Humans usually try to guess the pattern, and in the process we allow ourselves to be outperformed by a rat. Regression toward the mean: in any series of random events an extraordinary event is most likely to be followed, due purely to chance, by a more ordinary one. Successful people in every field are almost universally members of a certain set—the set of people who don’t give up. Hollywood studio executive: “If I had said yes to all the projects I turned down, and no to all the other ones I took, it would have worked out about the same.” Extraordinary events can happen without extraordinary causes. Random events often look like nonrandom events. The probability that two events will both occur can never be greater than the probability that each will occur individually. A good story is often less probable than a less satisfactory explanation. Cicero wrote that “probability is the very guide of life.” These three laws, simple as they are, form much of the basis of probability theory: If two possible events, A and B, are independent, then the probability that both A and B will occur is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. If an event can have a number of different and distinct possible outcomes, A, B, C, and so on, then the probability that either A or B will occur is equal to the sum of the individual probabilities of A and B, and the sum of the probabilities of all the possible outcomes (A, B, C, and so on) is 1 (that is, 100 percent). When you want to know the chances that two independent events, A and B, will both occur, you multiply; if you want to know the chances that either of two mutually exclusive events, A or B, will occur, you add. One should not appraise human action on the basis of its results. The law of small numbers.","I thought it was about the philosophy of randomness, but turned out to be about the math of probability. Might read again some day when in the mood for that."
How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World,Harry Browne,0965603679,3,"Freedom is the opportunity to live your life as you want to live it. For most people, freedom is an “if only.” “If only it hadn’t been for my wife…” Unhappiness is an involuntary feeling of discomfort as you react to things that don’t suit your nature. There would have to be a selfish person who would receive, accept, and enjoy the benefits of our unselfishness for there to be any point to it. But that selfish person (the object of our generosity) would be living by lower standards than we do. Popular misconceptions about the nature of government: 1. The belief that governments perform socially useful functions that deserve your support. 2. The belief that you have a duty to obey laws. 3. The belief that the government can be counted upon to carry out a social reform you favor. 4. The fear that the government is so powerful that it can prevent you from being free. Markets provide the only way to know exactly what individuals really want. Only when an individual gives up something he has in an exchange can you know how much he values the thing he says he desires. No one owes me moral conduct, respect, friendship, love, courtesy, or intelligence. Be involved with people who want to do the very things I want them to do. There are times when you feel that your rights are the only weapon you have in a dispute. If so, it usually indicates that you’ve made yourself vulnerable to someone whose self-interest conflicts with yours. It helps to remember that you are the one who put yourself in the vulnerable position. You have chosen to associate with those who cause you problems. If I concentrate on the thief’s immorality or on my rights, I’m probably leaving myself vulnerable to another theft. But if I use what I control to make new arrangements, I can see to it that the theft isn’t repeated. The sooner you pay a price, the less it costs you. The sooner you handle it, the easier it is. Don’t confront the government. Don’t organize. Don’t get a large group of people together. There are plenty of people who do the same things that teachers, doctors, architects, lawyers, beauticians, engineers, bankers, investment counselors, and psychiatrists do, but avoid all the legal requirements by not using the legal titles. The child should have his own world where he is clearly the sovereign. That means a room of his own that is subject to his control alone. If he’s forced to keep it as his parents wish, he’ll never discover for himself the consequences of alternative courses of action. He should also have other property to use in whatever way he chooses. Property isn’t owned if it can be used only in “approved” ways. Once he receives something, it’s important that he learn to understand what it means to own something and be responsible for its preservation. He shouldn’t be taught to expect automatic replacement of any property he might destroy. They first want him to believe that Santa Claus loves and rewards him and then later want him to understand that it’s the parents who love him. It would make a considerable difference if the child were never taught anything that you intend to reverse later. He lives in a world in which his future will be of his own making, encourage that by letting him deal directly with the world as much as possible. Dishonesty usually comes about as an attempt to avoid prices. It’s the hope of being able to do something without the consequences that would naturally follow — the reactions of certain people.","Some fun ""fist in the air"" thoughts on freedom, from 1973. Includes related thoughts on parenting and honesty."
The Sense of Style,Steven Pinker,0143127799,3,"Linger over good writing wherever you find it and reflect on what makes it good. Good writing can flip the way the world is perceived. The deliberate use of surprising transitions - colons, dashes, block quotations - is one of the hallmarks of lively prose. A lesser writer might have introduced this with the plodding “Here is another example of a column by Mrs. Phillips,” but Fox interrupts her narration without warning to redirect our gaze. A writer, like a cinematographer, manipulates the viewer’s perspective on an ongoing story, with the verbal equivalent of camera angles and quick cuts. Share a number of practices: * an insistence on fresh wording and concrete imagery over familiar verbiage and abstract summary * an attention to the readers’ vantage point and the target of their gaze * the judicious placement of an uncommon word or idiom against a backdrop of simple nouns and verbs * the use of parallel syntax * the occasional planned surprise * the presentation of a telling detail that obviates an explicit pronouncement * the use of meter and sound that resonate with the meaning and mood. Write as if they have something important to show. Which simulation should a writer immerse himself in when composing a piece for a more generic readership, such as an essay, an article, a review, an editorial, a newsletter, or a blog post? The literary scholars Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner have singled out one model of prose as an aspiration for such writers today. They call it classic style, and explain it in a wonderful little book called Clear and Simple as the Truth. The guiding metaphor of classic style is seeing the world. The writer can see something that the reader has not yet noticed, and he orients the reader’s gaze so that she can see it for herself. The purpose of writing is presentation, and its motive is disinterested truth. It succeeds when it aligns language with the truth, the proof of success being clarity and simplicity. The writer knows the truth before putting it into words; he is not using the occasion of writing to sort out what he thinks. Nor does the writer of classic prose have to argue for the truth; he just needs to present it. Writer of classic prose must simulate two experiences: showing the reader something in the world, and engaging her in conversation. The metaphor of showing implies that there is something to see. The things in the world the writer is pointing to, then, are concrete: people (or other animate beings) who move around in the world and interact with objects. The metaphor of conversation implies that the reader is cooperative. The writer can count on her to read between the lines, catch his drift, and connect the dots, without his having to spell out every step in his train of thought. Classic style is not a contemplative or romantic style, in which a writer tries to share his idiosyncratic, emotional, and mostly ineffable reactions to something. The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese. Sometimes we do have to write about abstract ideas. What classic style does is explain them as if they were objects and forces that would be recognizable to anyone standing in a position to see them. Classic writing, with its assumption of equality between writer and reader, makes the reader feel like a genius. They recognize that it’s hard to know the truth, and that our ways of understanding the world must constantly be scrutinized for hidden biases. It’s just that good writers don’t flaunt this anxiety in every passage they write; they artfully conceal it for clarity’s sake. Remembering that classic style is a pretense also makes sense of the seemingly outlandish requirement that a writer know the truth before putting it into words. Of course no writer works that way, but that is irrelevant. As with the celebrity chef: the messy work has been done beforehand and behind the scenes. One way to introduce a topic without metadiscourse is to open with a question: What makes a name rise and fall in popularity? Credits the reader with enough intelligence to realize that many concepts aren’t easy to define and that many controversies aren’t easy to resolve. She is there to see what the writer will do about it. If you’re not comfortable using an expression without apologetic quotation marks, you probably shouldn’t be using it at all. Classic style minimizes abstractions, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. Nominalization rule takes a perfectly spry verb and embalms it into a lifeless noun by adding a suffix like –ance, –ment, –ation, or –ing. A writer who has forgotten that he should be staging an event for the reader. He knows how the story turned out, so he just describes the outcome (something was done). But the reader, with no agent in sight, has no way to visualize the event being moved forward by its instigator. Keep in mind the guiding metaphor of classic style: a writer, in conversation with a reader, directs the reader’s gaze to something in the world. Curse of Knowledge: a difficulty in imagining what it is like for someone else not to know something that you know. The curse of knowledge is the single best explanation I know of why good people write bad prose. It simply doesn’t occur to the writer that her readers don’t know what she knows - that they haven’t mastered the patois of her guild, can’t divine the missing steps that seem too obvious to mention, have no way to visualize a scene that to her is as clear as day. And so she doesn’t bother to explain the jargon, or spell out the logic, or supply the necessary detail. “If you ever hear yourself saying, ‘I think I understand this,’ that means you don’t.” A third of our brains dedicated to vision, and large swaths devoted to touch, hearing, motion, and space. For us to go from “I think I understand” to “I understand,” we need to see the sights and feel the motions. Slicing away the layers of familiar abstraction. Show a draft to yourself, ideally after enough time has passed that the text is no longer familiar. Hard enough to formulate a thought that is interesting and true. Only after laying a semblance of it on the page can a writer free up the cognitive resources needed to make the sentence grammatical, graceful, and, most important, transparent to the reader. Morbidly obese phrases, together with leaner alternatives that often mean the same thing:16 make an appearance with appear with is capable of being can be is dedicated to providing provides in the event that if it is imperative that we we must brought about the organization of organized significantly expedite the process of speed up on a daily basis daily for the purpose of to in the matter of about in view of the fact that since owing to the fact that because relating to the subject of regarding. Make an appearance and put on a performance. Why not just use the verb that spawned the zombie in the first place, like appear or perform? Topic, then comment. Given, then new. Light before heavy. Principles of style that apply within a sentence, such as placing given before new information, apply to extended passages as well. Coherence begins with the writer and reader being clear about the topic. It’s essential to let the reader in on the topic early. The reader needs to know whether a writer is rabbiting on about a topic in order to explain it, convey interesting new facts about it, advance an argument about it, or use it as an example of an important generalization. In other words, a writer has to have both something to talk about (the topic) and something to say (the point). Two propositions that are similar in most ways but different in at least one way. Write the statements using parallel syntax and vary only the words that indicate the difference. Herons have one thing in their favor: they are opportunistic hunters. Herons have one thing not in their favor: they defend a fishing hole even when it is frozen. Work with the ongoing newsreel in readers’ minds and describe events in chronological order: She showered before she ate is easier to understand than She ate after she showered. You only live once should be rewritten as You live only once, with only next to the thing it quantifies, once. “We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard.” That sounds a lot classier than “We don’t choose to go to the moon because it is easy but because it is hard.” Not “We don’t choose to go to the moon because it is easy.” Responsible writers have to deal with counterarguments and counterevidence. But if there are enough of them, they deserve a section of their own, whose stated point is to examine the contrary position. This divide-and-conquer strategy is better than repeatedly allowing counterexamples to intrude into the main line of an argument. There is nothing wrong with beginning a sentence with a coordinator. and, because, but, or, so, also. Dangling modifiers. Checking into the hotel, it was nice to see a few of my old classmates in the lobby. Checking into the hotel, I was pleased to see a few of my old classmates in the lobby. Considering the hour, it is surprising that he arrived at all. Considering the hour, we should be surprised that he arrived at all. The implied subject of the modifier must be identical to the overt subject of the main clause. Some dangling modifiers should be avoided, but they are not grammatical errors. They takes part in a kind of notional agreement. No man and any girl are grammatically singular but psychologically plural: they pertain to classes with many individuals. The pronoun they is functioning as a bound variable: a symbol that keeps track of an individual across multiple descriptions of that individual. Experiments that measure readers’ comprehension times to the thousandth of a second have shown that singular they causes little or no delay, but generic he slows them down a lot. We are in the midst of a historical change that’s returning singular they to the acceptability it enjoyed before a purist crackdown in the nineteenth century. A slim majority of the panel accepts If anyone calls, tell them I can’t come to the phone and Everyone returned to their seats. The usage manuals have recommended two escape hatches for the singular pronoun trap. The easiest is to express the quantified description as a plural, which makes they a grammatically honest pronoun. You could change Every body began to have their vexation to They all began to have their vexations. Every writer should shorten their sentences is easily transformed into All writers should shorten their sentences or just Writers should shorten their sentences. The other escape hatch is to replace the pronoun with an indefinite or generic alternative and count on the reader’s common sense to fill in the referent: Every body began to have their vexation becomes Every body began to have a vexation, and Every dinosaur should look in his or her mirror becomes Every dinosaur should look in the mirror. A few common errors are so uncontroversial - it’s - that they have become tantamount to the confession “I am illiterate.” They betray a history of inattention to the printed page. Commas set off a phrase that is not an integral constituent of the sentence, and which as a result is not essential to understanding its meaning. Susan visited her friend Teresa tells us that it’s important for us to know that Susan singled out Teresa as the person she intended to visit. In Susan visited her friend, Teresa, it’s only significant that Susan visited a friend (oh, and by the way, the friend’s name is Teresa). A comma also signals a prosodic break: a slight pause in pronunciation. Jane Austen and the framers of the American Constitution would get poor grades from composition teachers today, because commas are regulated less by prosody and more by syntax. Not only are commas partly regulated by prosody, but until recently that was their principal function. Writers used to place them wherever they thought a pause felt natural, regardless of the sentence’s syntax: One comma mistake is so common: using a comma to join two complete sentences, each of which could stand on its own. Before the recent trend toward light punctuation, apostrophes were often used to pluralize years (the 1970’s), abbreviations (CPU’s), and symbols (@’s), As for names ending in s like Charles and Jones, go with grammatical logic and treat them as the singulars they are: Charles’s son, not Charles’ son. Some manuals stipulate an exception for Moses. Quotation marks signal that the author is not using words to convey their usual meaning but merely mentioning them as words. If you really want to improve the quality of your writing, the principles you should worry about the most are critical thinking and factual diligence. First, look things up. Much of our conventional wisdom consists of friend-of-a-friend legends. Try to restrict the things you write to things that are true. If you are making a factual claim, it should be verifiable. If you’re making a moral argument - a claim about what people ought to do - you should show how doing it would satisfy a principle or increase a good that reasonable people already accept. Don’t confuse an anecdote or a personal experience with the state of the world. Few good ideas can be insightfully captured in a single word ending with -ism. Most of our ideas are so crude that we can make more progress by analyzing and refining them than by pitting them against each other in a winner-take-all contest.","Advice on being a better writer. But compare to the book “On Writing Well”, also listed here. That one is punchy and immediately useful. This one is a more verbose, in-depth analysis of the use of language. Also useful, but, well, I wish it was shorter."
A More Beautiful Question,Warren Berger,1620401452,3,"He took ownership of that question, Why can’t they make a better foot? To replace they with I. If you never actually do anything about a problem yourself, then you’re not really questioning—you’re complaining. We think someone else will solve that problem. But there isn’t anyone else. Good questioners tend to be comfortable with, their own ignorance. I know more about my ignorance than you know about yours. Ask, Now that we know what we now know, what’s possible now? When it comes to questioning, companies are like people: They start out doing it, then gradually do it less and less. As expertise loses its “shelf life,” it also loses some of its value. Known answers are everywhere, and easily accessible. The real value, is in what you can do with that knowledge. The glut of knowledge makes us more ignorant. As our collective knowledge grows, the amount that the individual knows, in relation to the growing body of knowledge, is smaller. There’s more darkness into which we can shine that “question flashlight.” (neoteny being a biological term that describes the retention of childlike attributes in adulthood). A pattern in many of the stories: • Person encounters a situation that is less than ideal; asks Why. • Person begins to come up with ideas for possible improvements/solutions—with such ideas usually surfacing in the form of What If possibilities. • Person takes one of those possibilities and tries to implement it or make it real; this mostly involves figuring out How. The worst thing you can do with a difficult question is to try to answer it too quickly. When we start teaching too much, too soon, says Gopnik, we’re inadvertently cutting off paths of inquiry and exploration that kids might otherwise pursue on their own. If they are permitted to do that research—to raise and explore their own questions, through various forms of experimentation, and without being burdened with instructions—they exhibit signs of more creativity and curiosity. Young kids learn in much the same way scientists do, by exploring and experimenting, and that we should beware of trends toward more structured and academic early-childhood programs. That academic rigor comes soon enough, as students begin grade school. Preschool children, on average, ask their parents about 100 questions a day. By middle school, they’ve pretty much stopped asking. What are schools for? (That question could also be phrased as Why are we sending kids to school in the first place?) Should we abandon the failed experiment of teaching facts? “Lower-income parents are not wrong,” she said. “They know that if their kids ask questions, they might get in trouble. They’re telling their children to be careful in school.” The middle-class kids are in a different situation, Meier notes. “They go to school feeling safe.” And because they feel safe, they can take the risk of raising their hands. While other mothers asked their kids ‘Did you learn anything today?’ [my mother ] would say, ‘Izzy, did you ask a good question today?’ It’s not insignificant that Edwin Land was on vacation when the big Why question surfaced. He was removed from the day-to-day rush of his work. He had the time and the distance from practical business matters to entertain a question that was highly impractical. Position myself relentlessly as an idiot: it’s a positive. Because being comfortable with not knowing—that’s the first part of being able to question. In Iceland during the country’s financial meltdown, “I asked stupid questions like ‘Where’s the money?’ Because no one seemed to be able to give a straight answer to this basic question. The value in asking naïve questions, Bennett says, is that it forces people to explain things simply. “If I just keep saying, ‘I don’t get it, can you tell me why once more?,’ it forces people to synthesize and simplify—to strip away the irrelevances and get to the core idea.” In some parts of Asia, people sometimes welcome outsiders coming in and asking basic questions because they may be wondering about these things themselves—but they don’t want to ask because they can’t afford to look foolish or disrespectful. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.","A fine book, but maybe because I've been around professional creatives instead of corporate-types for most of my life, I already knew this subject too well, so it wasn't very useful to me."
Make It Stick,Peter Brown,0674729013,3,"Learning really means acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities. Learning is deeper and more durable when it’s effortful. When learning is harder and slower and it doesn’t feel productive, we are drawn to strategies that feel more fruitful, unaware that the gains from these strategies are often temporary. A single, simple quiz after reading a text or hearing a lecture produces better learning and remembering than rereading the text. Periodic practice stops forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain. Trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when errors are made in the attempt. When you space out practice at a task and get a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects, retrieval is harder and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables more versatile application of it in later settings. When you’re adept at extracting the underlying principles or “rules” that differentiate types of problems, you’re more successful at picking the right solutions in unfamiliar situations. This skill is better acquired through interleaved and varied practice than massed practice. We’re all susceptible to illusions that can hijack our judgment of what we know and can do. Testing helps calibrate our judgments of what we’ve learned. All new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge. To learn trigonometry, you need to remember your algebra and geometry. Give new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. Learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge. When learning is hard, you’re doing important work. “Creativity is more important than knowledge”: You wouldn’t want to see that t-shirt on your neurosurgeon or on the captain who’s flying your plane. Testing is a tool for learning. Even after ten years piloting the same business jet, his employer reinforces his mastery every six months in a battery of tests and flight simulations that require him to retrieve the information and maneuvers. To learn better and remember longer: various forms of retrieval practice, such as low-stakes quizzing and self-testing, spacing out practice, interleaving the practice of different but related topics or skills, trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution, distilling the underlying principles or rules that differentiate types of problems, and so on. Reflection is a form of practice. Reflection can involve several cognitive activities that lead to stronger learning: retrieving knowledge and earlier training from memory, connecting these to new experiences, and visualizing and mentally rehearsing what you might do differently next time. To improve the way we learn, find a way to interrupt the process of forgetting. After reading passages on the history of slavery, students are asked to write down ten facts about slavery they hadn’t known before. Giving feedback on wrong answers to test questions strengthens retention more than testing alone does, and, interestingly, some evidence shows that delaying the feedback briefly produces better long-term learning than immediate feedback. Effortful retrieval makes for stronger learning and retention. We’re easily seduced into believing that learning is better when it’s easier, but the research shows the opposite: when the mind has to work, learning sticks better. Practice that’s spaced out, interleaved with other learning, and varied produces better mastery, longer retention, and more versatility. Examples of massed practice: boot camps, fast learning, cramming. Half the docs completed all four lessons in a single day, half had a week’s interval between them. Those whose lessons had been spaced a week apart outperformed their colleagues in all areas. Embedding new learning in long-term memory requires a process of consolidation, in which memory traces (the brain’s representations of the new learning) are strengthened, given meaning, and connected to prior knowledge. Rapid-fire practice leans on short-term memory. A spiraling series of exercises that cycle back to key skillsets in a seemingly random sequence that adds layers of context and meaning at each turn. Interleaving the practice of two or more subjects or skills is also a more potent alternative to massed practice. Learning from interleaved practice feels slower, but interleaved and variable practice proved more helpful than massed practice for learning the underlying concepts that unite and differentiate the species and families. The kind of retrieval practice that proves most effective is one that reflects what you’ll be doing with the knowledge later. Space out study and practice in installments, enough so that practice doesn’t become a mindless repetition. Enough time so that a little forgetting has set in. If you’re practicing something over and over in rapid-fire fashion, you’re leaning on short-term memory, and very little mental effort is required. Retrieving a memory from long-term storage can both strengthen the memory traces and connect to more recent learning. The more you’ve forgotten about a topic, the more effective relearning will be in shaping your permanent knowledge. When you’re asked to struggle with solving a problem before being shown how to solve it, the subsequent solution is better learned and more durably remembered. When letters are omitted from words in a text, retention improves. Unsuccessful attempts to solve a problem encourage deep processing of the answer when it is later supplied. Review what has been learned, asking yourself questions: What are the key ideas? What are some examples? How do these relate to what I already know? What went well? What could have gone better? What might I need to learn for better mastery? Write to learn: express the main ideas in your own words. People who are taught that learning is a struggle that often involves making errors will go on to exhibit a greater propensity to tackle tough challenges. Desirable difficulties: Difficulties are desirable because they trigger encoding and retrieval processes that support learning, comprehension, and remembering. If, however, the learner does not have the background knowledge or skills to respond to them successfully, they become undesirable difficulties. Learning is at least a three-step process: initial encoding of information is held in short-term working memory before being consolidated into a cohesive representation of knowledge in long-term memory. Consolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them meaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory. Retrieval updates learning and enables you to apply it when you need it. Meta is Greek for “about”. Our understanding of the world is shaped by a hunger for narrative that rises out of our discomfort with ambiguity. Overhearing one side of a conversation proved more distracting than overhearing both sides, and the content of those partial conversations was better recalled later by the unintentional eavesdroppers. Hypothetical events that are imagined vividly can seat themselves in the mind as firmly as memories of actual events. The better you know something, the more difficult it becomes to teach it. As you get more expert in complex areas, your models in those areas grow more complex, and the component steps that compose them fade into the background of memory. “Unskilled and Unaware of It”: the Dunning-Kruger effect. Incompetent people overestimate their own competence and see no need to try to improve. Incompetent people can be taught to raise their competence by learning the skills to judge their own performance more accurately. Students will learn better under an instructor who knows where improvement is needed and structures the practice required to achieve. Replace subjective experience as the basis for decisions with a set of objective gauges outside ourselves, like cockpit instruments. Your judgment and learning are calibrated by working alongside a more experienced partner: The apprentice model. Analytical intelligence is our ability to complete problem-solving tasks such as those typically contained in tests Creative intelligence is our ability to synthesize and apply existing knowledge and skills to deal with new and unusual situations Practical intelligence is our ability to adapt to everyday life—to understand what needs to be done in a specific setting and then do it - what we call street smarts. Strengthening one skill does not automatically strengthen others. Learning and memory strategies are effective for enhancing intellectual abilities in the material or skills practiced, but the benefits don’t extend to mastery of other material or skills. The benefits are more likely the fruits of better habits, such as learning how to focus attention and persist at practice. A kid who is genetically just a little bit more curious becomes significantly smarter if she’s in an environment that feeds curiosity.",Great core point: that effortful learning - not easy - is more effective. Also the importance of self-testing as a learning tool.
The Power of No,James and Claudia Altucher,1401945872,3,"Decide who in your life drains you of energy, and then purge them so you can soar. The best way to negotiate is to take the time and space to determine what is best for you. You succeed by saying yes only when you are ready and the conditions are right. In removing yourself temporarily from the situation, you reduce the supply of yourself. In basic economics, value is a function of supply and demand. When supply goes down, value goes up. To stop negative chatter: Imagine someone you love. Imagine what you would say to him or her. Now say it to yourself. I wrote down ideas every day for articles I could write and businesses I could start. If you don’t exercise the idea muscle, it atrophies just like any other muscle. And it atrophies quickly. You must work the idea muscle every day to turn into an idea machine. Being clear about which relationships and which people we let into our lives is the key to access our creative forces. Filtering the people we allow into our lives is probably the most important factor in determining whether we will live a happy life or not. The primary people in your life: Rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how you feel after your interactions with that person, 10 being the best. Anyone lower than an 8, begin to pull back from. Lower than a 5, stay a little farther away from. It doesn’t mean you cut people off completely if they rate low on your list. This is a dimmer switch, not an on-and-off switch. Nobody had been on that date that night. As far as I could see, two bodies were out and about in Orlando, but no souls. Gary and Lisa were not there; rather, it was two sets of rules playing against each other, two books filled with instructions, pick-up lines, controlling strategies, and a ten-step guide. I had never been present on a date either. I had never met a man without having an agenda. Women will also tell you who they are in this way. Actions, words, being on time or not, playing games or not, all of these details reveal us. People who are disrespectful or manipulative early on are likely to continue the pattern. Take them at face value. Whenever I feel abused or disrespected, I go into a cycle of thinking that is difficult to stop. You think again about the person, whisper in your head somewhat louder, “No.” And then louder. And then actually whisper it aloud. You will eventually stop thinking about that person. Jealousy is the road map to the place where I feel unloved. “Think of your life as a train station,” I said. “You are on the platform and you see a train approaching. You really want this train to be your train. You like the way it shines and how it seems so cool and strong - you are convinced it is the one that will take you home. And so you start making signals to it, and then you even start jumping up and down close to the tracks. “But this train is not meant to stop here. The conductor of the train is confused. She starts to slow down and wonders what you are doing. She is nervous. “Sensing that the train is not stopping, you jump onto the tracks, to the horror of all the people around you, and make even bigger arm signals while you jump up and down. By now the horrified conductor is calling the police and pressing all sorts of red buttons. Emergency vehicles are arriving on the scene. Everything is coming to a halt. “Meanwhile, the train that is meant for you, the one that is your train by divine design, is right behind this one. Only you cannot see this because you are too busy causing unnecessary drama. “Your train is waiting somewhere, feeling lonely, unable to pull into your station. The conductor of the train that is meant for you wonders what may be causing the delays. She longs to arrive home, and all the while it is you who is causing the traffic jam, because you just can’t stop jumping up and down.” To say no to self-sabotage, get out of the train tracks and accept the flow of life. Let the train continue, wish it well as it leaves, and trust that yours is coming. The next time someone has an opinion you strongly disagree with, try this: Don’t argue; it’s pointless. You will never change their mind. Let them state their opinion. Try to learn one thing from it. Try to respect one angle of their point of view. Everyone just wants to be heard. Listen. Don’t do anything you don’t want to do. When you agree to do something you don’t want to do, you will resent the person who asked you to do it. There is a psychological law that says we all tend to follow our own ways of thinking without changing because we want to appear “consistent.” You have to domesticate your brain the way you domesticate a dog. The useful/not useful technique: With each thought that comes up, label it either useful or not useful. Saying no to others means first saying no to your brain - to the anxieties and the regrets and the not-useful thoughts. Attempt one week of living without any complaints whatsoever. There are “rules” to follow if you want the girl or the guy to like you and love you. What happens when she finds the real you is another story. By that time there might not be a real you anyway. Between black and white there is a beautiful spectrum. Not of grays but of all the colors of the universe. Everywhere you go there are rules and there are gatekeepers of those rules: total strangers whose job it is to prevent you from doing something you want to do. Showing compassion toward those gatekeepers will allow those gates to magically swing open more often than you can possibly hope to expect otherwise. Why? Because the gatekeepers are not used to receiving a sudden onslaught of compassion or genuine love. Ask yourself, What do I really need to understand? And be quiet. Listen for the answers. How do you recognize an abusive person? These are some of the most common ways: a) They try to make you feel guilty. b) They try to make you angry. c) They try to make you afraid. d) They try to make you feel wrong. e) They try to make themselves the victim. How do I feel about myself when I am around this person? Do I feel good about myself? If the answer is no, you know you need to move away from the person. Many people say, “Live life like it’s your last day.” It’s everyone else you need to think about. Treat everyone else as if it’s their last day. Try to help them be less stressed. Try to fulfill their dreams for the day. You don’t talk badly about someone about to die. Really listen to them. Learn from them. Honesty to a point. I will never harm anyone. Whoever needs to manipulate is actually in the weaker position. Everything you say might seem to them like a suicide note, when I first started revealing the most intimate issues of my life. Notice those things that you tend to passionately dislike in others. These traits live in you, too. They are the part that you’d rather not look at. Ask the question, “Where am I like this?” To keep living in scarcity is to reject the next phase in our evolution. Clichés exist for a reason: they contain the seeds of truth. Write a things-I-did list at the end of the day. The people who use luck as an accusation who will never have it. Luck is something that is earned, and once you have earned it, you will always know how to get it back. You will say no to the people who try to bring you down, who try to use their own bad luck to control you Luck equals (1) diversification plus (2) persistence. Diversification means coming up with a thousand ideas and implementing the 1 or 2 percent that seem reasonable. Persistence is a sentence filled with failures punctuated by the occasional success. When you are speaking with other people, silences are good. Pauses mean love. Rushing our words means fear. It shows our inability to pay attention, that we don’t want to let anything in, we must fill in the silences, and we think we know better. Lead lives that teach by example, that show instead of tell. Sit. For one hour. All at once. Every day. Be silent, and let your thoughts go. Silence works. Nobody can teach anyone how to do this. Be careful that your definition of minimalism doesn’t border on a sort of material anorexia, where you deny yourself the small celebrations that life wants you to have. Silence is the sign of a professional. You know not to ask a professional what he’s working on. What he’s seen. The less supply you give of your words and wisdom, the greater value that wisdom will have. The less you talk, the more the brain conserves its energy for when words are important. Before, during, and after you think, say, or do anything, determine if it will harm someone. To practice positive thinking on legitimately bad situations will only make you more stuck. When you go on a long trip, you see the road in front of you. You trust that if you stay on that road, you will get to where you need to be. You don’t try to see the end of the road. You surrender to the fact that the road knows better than you what is at the end of it. Outsource 90 percent of mentorship to books. Time it takes to reinvent yourself: five years. Here’s a description of the five years: Year One: You’re flailing and reading everything and just starting to do. Year Two: You know who you need to talk to and network with. You’re doing every day. You finally know what the Monopoly board looks like in your new endeavors. Year Three: You’re good enough to start making money. It might not be a living yet. Year Four: You’re making a good living, and you can quit your day job. Year Five: You’re making wealth. When people say, “It’s not about the money,” they should make sure they have a different measuring stick. Take your favorite story by your favorite author and type it word for word. Ask yourself why he wrote each word. He’s your mentor today. If you want to start a business, write all the specs and details of the idea for your business. How do I know what I should do? Whatever area you feel like reading 500 books about. Use your spare time to reinvent. Reinvention is collecting little bits and pieces of time and carving them the way you want them to be. Say no to the superfluous distractions because you must find some time for you. After books, you can read websites, forums, magazines. But most of that is garbage. Start with 500 books. Sleep is the number-one key to successful health. Remember the last day of school, there was this massive feeling of “Who cares?” because there was nothing left to care about. No exams, no assignments, no boring classes. Death. It’s like the last day of school all over again.","Quite scattered book, but inside the mess was a nice reminder of the importance of saying no to anything that doesn't serve you well."
How to Learn and Memorize French Vocabulary,Anthony Metivier,1482667002,3,"I have lived in eight cities, twenty-five houses (or apartments) and sixteen neighborhoods within those cities. Sub-divide locations into individual stations. When you consider each apartment, home or building a “location,” then each individual room will be a station within that location. Exaggerate the size and colors because the larger and more colorful the image, the more memorable. Every word that begins with “inter” can be automatically associated with, say, Anne Hathaway, who played an intern in The Devil Wears Prada. The images themselves are the training wheels. They are not necessarily meant to stay after you’ve grown with the system. When the mind is tense, busy or exhausted, it will resist attempts at memorization.

The apartment was on Feurigstraße, I used that apartment and every station in that palace to remember words that begin with the letter ‘F.’ Because I don’t have to spend any time remembering that all ‘F’ words are connected with the Feurigstraße palace, I don’t have to make any odd leaps in my mind searching for words that start with “F.” Every location is a Memory Palace and as much as possible, that location should start with the same letter of the words that you will store there. a) Never cross your own path b) Never trap yourself In creating these “journeys” through the stations of a Memory Palace, Select at least 10 different locations that you remember well. If you are feeling motivated, you can list all 26 giving you locations enough for the entire alphabet. These locations could be apartments or houses you’ve lived in, schools, libraries, workplaces. Select and list at least 10 “stations” within each of the locations. Stations can be entire rooms, which I recommend when you are just getting started, or they can be more specific. You could use an armchair and then the lamp table beside it as two different stations, for instance. Take a walk through each palace and the stations that you have identified. While wandering, make each and every station vivid in your mind. Give yourself an exam. Write out everything fresh and then compare the list you wrote out from memory with the original. Create multiple Excel files. T = Trevor’s House U = University Library V = Valleyview Beer & Wine Leave yourself with the ability to add another 10 stations in each location. For some letters, you may need up to 500 stations. Create a special palace just for grammar rules. For an excellent online French conjugation resource, visit: http://www.conjugation-fr.com/ I associate all masculine nouns with a boxer and all feminine nouns with a skirt. For example, to remember that “fruits” (fruit) is masculine and therefore “le fruits,” I see a pineapple wearing boxing gloves. To give you an example of a feminine noun, take “la lune” (the sun). It’s a simple matter to see the moon wearing a skirt. Don’t do anything until you’ve fully and clearly understood how to use location, imagination and action in order to effectively memorize at least ten items. It will take between 1-5 hours to come up with 26 locations and at least 10 stations within each. Learn the genders of every word right away. Decide upon what will signify masculine and feminine and use them consistently. Make adjectives a priority. Adjectives allow you to flavor your speaking and deepen your understanding of innuendo and metaphor. When you do work with verbs, pick strong verbs and learn more than one version of each (instead of just “run,” also learn “jog” and “sprint”). As for nouns, use a Visual Dictionary to find your words. Sit with a dictionary as often as possible. You are literally going to siphon the dictionary into your mind. Find the words that interest you the most or that you think will be the most useful and focus on them. Focus on steady progress rather than being a completionist. Many words you will encounter can mean several things at once. Focus on just one meaning at a time. Gather together “clusters” of related words. For example, you could focus on words related to health, education, a particular sport or any particular category. Gather together words based on a theme that start with the same letter and then place them in palace accordingly. Going back and compounding the images. In most cases, a second pass will do the trick. I have used both the Toronto, New York and Berlin subway systems as Memory Palaces. One of the best methods for reading a book quickly is to pretend that you will be interviewing the author on live television the next day. All learning is memorization and all memorization is learning. I have had people regularly tell me about learning 100 words in under an hour. When I sit down to read a sophisticated novel, I need to put in some time extending my Memory Palaces and inserting new words. I do this before reading, during reading and after reading. Avoid rote learning at all costs. Let your Memory Palace skills do the work. Compound your images when testing routines reveal weaknesses. The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School and at Play is a wonderful resource. Get it here: http://memorizegermanvocabulary.com/harrylorayne Lorayne’s website is also well worth visiting. You’ll also want to read Tony Buzan. I recommend Use Your Perfect Memory. http://memorizegermanvocabulary.com/tonybuzan My favorite audio program is Dominic O’Brien’s Quantum Memory Power: Learn to Improve Your Memory. He reads the book himself, making it a wonderful experience. His passion for memorization techniques really shines through. http://memorizegermanvocabulary.com/quantummemorypower Mega Memory is one of the best memory products I’ve ever encountered: http://memorizegermanvocabulary.com/megamemory If ever you are uncertain of how to pronounce French words, check out this amazing resource: http://www.forvo.com Saying the alphabet backwards is the equivalent of skipping rope with your brain. Create a 26-station Memory Palace. Place each object must start with a letter of the alphabet in reverse order, i.e. zebra, yolk, xylophone, weathervain, etc. Each car has 13 locations: The front driver’s side headlight The front passenger’s side headlight The engine hood The windshield The steering wheel The driver seat The passenger seat, etc. Each car having 13 locations is that I don’t feel like I have to memorize an entire deck. Instead, I only need to remember 13 cards per car. I like my stations to be as close together as possible.","Only interesting if you haven't read anything else about the “loci” / “memory palace” method of memorization. Had almost nothing to do with French. Obviously made from copy-n-paste with his other books about German, Spanish, Russian, etc. Just change a few words, and voila! New ebook."
The Checklist Manifesto,Atul Gawande,53096448,3,"We have just two reasons that we may fail: 1. Ignorance 2. Ineptitude - knowledge exists, yet we fail to apply it correctly. Much of the world is outside our understanding and control. There are substantial realms, however, in which control is within our reach. Three different kinds of problems in the world: 1. SIMPLE ... like baking a cake from a mix. There is a recipe. Sometimes a few basic techniques to learn. But once these are mastered, following the recipe brings a high likelihood of success. 2. COMPLICATED ... like sending a rocket to the moon. They can sometimes be broken down into a series of simple problems. But there is no straightforward recipe. Success frequently requires multiple people, often multiple teams, and specialized expertise. Unanticipated difficulties are frequent. Timing and coordination become serious concerns. 3. COMPLEX ... like raising a child. Every child is unique. Although raising one child may provide experience, it does not guarantee success with the next child. Expertise is valuable but most certainly not sufficient. Outcomes for complex problems remain highly uncertain. It is possible to raise a child well. It’s complex, that’s all. CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE: A line-by-line, day-by-day listing of every building task that needed to be accomplished, in what order, and when. The whole checklist is sent to the subcontractors and other independent experts so they can double-check that everything is correct, that nothing has been missed. What results is remarkable: a succession of day-by-day checks that guide how the building is constructed and ensure that the knowledge of hundreds, perhaps thousands, is put to use in the right place at the right time in the right way. Submittal schedule specified communication tasks. Managers dealt with the unexpected and the uncertain by making sure the experts spoke to one another - on X date regarding Y process. The experts could make their individual judgments, but they had to do so as part of a team that took one another’s concerns into account, discussed unplanned developments, and agreed on the way forward. While no one could anticipate all the problems, they could foresee where and when they might occur. The checklist therefore detailed who had to talk to whom, by which date, and about what. COMMUNICATION: Trust in the power of communication. Don’t believe in the wisdom of the single individual, of even an expert. Believe in the wisdom of the group, the wisdom of making sure that multiple pairs of eyes were on a problem and then letting the watchers decide what to do. When you’re confronted with complex, nonroutine problems, push the power of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. Give people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility. They had made the reliable management of complexity a routine. That routine requires balancing a number of virtues: freedom and discipline, craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration. And for checklists to help achieve that balance, they have to take two almost opposing forms. They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but critical stuff is not overlooked, and they supply another set of checks to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances RESTAURANT: A checklist for every customer. When an order was placed up front, it was printed out on a slip back in the kitchen. The ticket specified the dishes ordered, the table number, the seat number, any preferences required by the customer or noted in a database from previous visits - food allergies, for instance, or how the steak should be cooked, or whether this was a special occasion like a birthday or a visit from a VIP. GROUP: “That’s not my problem” is possibly the worst thing people can think. Silent disengagement, the consequence of specialized technicians sticking narrowly to their domains. We need them to see their job not just as performing their isolated set of tasks well but also as helping the group get the best possible results. People who don’t know one another’s names don’t work together nearly as well as those who do. USABLE CHECKLISTS: The checklist was too long. It was unclear. And past a certain point, it was starting to feel like a distraction. The checklist cannot be lengthy. A rule of thumb some use is to keep it to between five and nine items, After about sixty to ninety seconds at a given pause point, the checklist often becomes a distraction from other things. People start “shortcutting.” Steps get missed. So you want to keep the list short by focusing on what he called “the killer items” - the steps that are most dangerous to skip and sometimes overlooked nonetheless. Ideally, it should fit on one page. It is common to misconceive how checklists function in complex lines of work. They are not comprehensive how-to guides. They are quick and simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert professionals. Balance between brevity and effectiveness. Cut too much and you won’t have enough checks to improve care. Leave too much in and the list becomes too long to use. Furthermore, an item critical to one expert might not be critical to another. BAD CHECKLISTS ... are vague and imprecise. They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical. They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in which they are to be deployed. They treat the people using the tools as dumb and try to spell out every single step. They turn people’s brains off rather than turn them on. GOOD CHECKLISTS ... are precise. They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most difficult situations. They do not try to spell out everything - a checklist cannot fly a plane. They provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps - the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss. Good checklists are, above all, practical. The power of checklists is limited. They can help experts remember how to manage a complex process or configure a complex machine. They can make priorities clearer and prompt people to function better as a team. By themselves, however, checklists cannot make anyone follow them. You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed to be used You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO checklist. DO-CONFIRM checklist: ... team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often separately. But then they stop. They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done. READ-DO checklist: people carry out the tasks as they check them off - it’s more like a recipe. We adopted mainly a DO-CONFIRM rather than a READ-DO format, to give people greater flexibility in performing their tasks while nonetheless having them stop at key points to confirm that critical steps have not been overlooked. Must nurses make written check marks? No, we decided, they didn’t have to. This wasn’t a record-keeping procedure. We were aiming for a team conversation to ensure that everyone had reviewed what was needed We had a team in London try the draft checklist and give us suggestions, then a team in Hong Kong. With each successive round, the checklist got better. Even the most expert among us can gain from searching out the patterns of mistakes and failures and putting a few checks in place. INVESTING: Neuroscientists have found that the prospect of making money stimulates the same primitive reward circuits in the brain that cocaine does. And that, Pabrai said, is when serious investors like himself try to become systematic. They focus on dispassionate analysis, on avoiding both irrational exuberance and panic. They pore over the company’s financial reports, investigate its liabilities and risks, examine its management team’s track record, weigh its competitors, consider the future of the market it is in - trying to gauge both the magnitude of opportunity and the margin of safety. He had repeatedly erred in determining how “leveraged” companies were - how much cash was really theirs, how much was borrowed, and how risky those debts were. The information was available; he just hadn’t looked for it carefully enough. In large part, he believes, the mistakes happened because he wasn’t able to damp down the cocaine brain. No matter how objective he tried to be about a potentially exciting investment, he said, he found his brain working against him, latching onto evidence that confirmed his initial hunch and dismissing the signs of a downside. It’s what the brain does. Pabrai added the following checkpoint to his list: when analyzing a company, stop and confirm that you’ve asked yourself whether the revenues might be overstated or understated due to boom or bust conditions. Cook made a checklist. But he was even more methodical: he enumerated the errors known to occur at any point in the investment process - during the research phase, during decision making, during execution of the decision, and even in the period after making an investment when one should be monitoring for problems. He then designed detailed checklists to avoid the errors, complete with clearly identified pause points at which he and his investment team would run through the items. He has a Day Three Checklist, for example, which he and his team review at the end of the third day of considering an investment. By that point, the checklist says, they should confirm that they have gone over the prospect’s key financial statements for the previous ten years, including checking for specific items in each statement and possible patterns across the statements. “It’s easy to hide in a statement. It’s hard to hide between statements,” Cook said. One check, for example, requires the members of the team to verify that they’ve read the footnotes on the cash flow statements. Another has them confirm they’ve reviewed the statement of key management risks. A third asks them to make sure they’ve looked to see whether cash flow and costs match the reported revenue growth. The checklist doesn’t tell him what to do, he explained. It is not a formula. But the checklist helps him be as smart as possible every step of the way, ensuring that he’s got the critical information he needs when he needs it, that he’s systematic about decision making, that he’s talked to everyone he should. With a good checklist in hand, he was convinced he and his partners could make decisions as well as human beings are able. VENTURE CAPITALISTS STYLES OF THINKING: “Art Critics” assessed entrepreneurs almost at a glance, the way an art critic can assess the quality of a painting - intuitively and based on long experience. “Sponges” took more time gathering information about their targets, soaking up whatever they could from interviews, on-site visits, references, and the like. Then they went with whatever their guts told them. As one such investor told Smart, he did “due diligence by mucking around.” “Prosecutors” interrogated entrepreneurs aggressively, testing them with challenging questions about their knowledge and how they would handle random hypothetical situations. “Suitors” focused more on wooing people than on evaluating them. “Terminators” saw the whole effort as doomed to failure and skipped the evaluation part. They simply bought what they thought were the best ideas, fired entrepreneurs they found to be incompetent, and hired replacements. “Airline Captains.” took a methodical, checklist-driven approach to their task. Studying past mistakes and lessons from others in the field, they built formal checks into their process. They forced themselves to be disciplined and not to skip steps, even when they found someone they “knew” intuitively was a real prospect. Smart next tracked the venture capitalists’ success over time. There was no question which style was most effective - and by now you should be able to guess which one. It was the Airline Captain. The Airline Captains had a median 80 percent return on the investments studied, the others 35 percent or less. Smart published his findings more than a decade ago. He has since gone on to explain them in a best-selling business book on hiring called Who. OTHER: The checklist gets the dumb stuff out of the way, the routines your brain shouldn’t have to occupy itself with, and lets it rise above to focus on the hard stuff. All learned occupations have a definition of professionalism, a code of conduct. It is where they spell out their ideals and duties. First is an expectation of selflessness: that we who accept responsibility for others - place the needs and concerns of those who depend on us above our own. Second is an expectation of skill: that we will aim for excellence in our knowledge and expertise. Third is an expectation of trustworthiness: that we will be responsible in our personal behavior toward our charges. Aviators, however, add a fourth expectation, discipline: discipline in following prudent procedure and in functioning with others. Discipline is hard - harder than trustworthiness and skill and perhaps even than selflessness. We are by nature flawed and inconstant creatures. We can’t even keep from snacking between meals. We are not built for discipline. We are built for novelty and excitement, not for careful attention to detail. Discipline is something we have to work at. FLIGHT CHECKLISTS: I went to the library and pulled out a few articles on how flight checklists are made. The handbook was comprised not of one checklist but of scores of them. Each one was remarkably brief, usually just a few lines on a page in big, easy-to-read type. And each applied to a different situation. Taken together, they covered a vast range of flight scenarios. First came what pilots call their “normal” checklists - the routine lists they use for everyday aircraft operations. There were the checks they do before starting the engines, before pulling away from the gate, before taxiing to the runway, and so on. In all, these took up just three pages. The rest of the handbook consisted of the “non-normal” checklists covering every conceivable emergency situation a pilot might run into: smoke in the cockpit, different warning lights turning on, a dead radio, a copilot becoming disabled, and engine failure, to name just a few. They addressed situations most pilots never encounter in their entire careers. But the checklists were there should they need them.","Like Malcom Gladwell, a book that could and should have been an article, but puffed up with 200 pages of supporting stories, mostly great detailed tales of his surgeon experiences where a checklist would have come in handy. Here's the book in one sentence: You should make checklists for any complex procedures or decisions."
Hiring Smart,Pierre Mornell,1580085148,3,"### BEFORE Before the initial interview, pick up the phone and call the candidate. How hard or easy is it to reach the candidate? Does the candidate return your call at the specific times that you suggest? I review time, place, and dress for the initial interview by phone. Five to 10 percent of interviewees will screw up this first test. Regardless of the material already in your file, ask the candidate to send a resume with a one-page cover letter that briefly highlights his or her life and background. Is the response slow or prompt? How long before the letter and resume arrive by mail or fax? Is the candidate literate or illiterate? Sloppy or neat? 65 percent of executive candidates lie about their academic credentials. Forty-three percent lie about their job responsibilities. Forty-two percent lie about previous compensation. A resume must always be verified. It is a red light if a person behaves deceptively on something as basic as a resume. Ask the candidate to visit one of your stores, plants, campuses, offices, or Web page before the interview. Then ask for the candidate’s observations. Most candidates wait for the beginning of the “official” interview like a runner waits for the starter’s gun to fire. These few minutes are a terrific opportunity to take a brief stroll about the office and make small talk, while lowering anxieties. “How was your drive? Any trouble finding the office? Would you like some coffee?” Look for curiosity - does the candidate ask questions? What other behavior does the candidate exhibit? Curiosity is a valuable asset in an employee. It demonstrates a desire to gratify the mind with new discoveries, to learn about novel and extraordinary things. Read the top candidates’ resumes in teams of three to five people. Watch for one of your team members to emerge, often unpredictably, as your in-house resume expert. Let a wide range of people know that you’re looking. What Dave observed at the dinner party and hotel were the potential candidates’ behaviors. Casting the widest net possible, he is always on the lookout for the best candidates available, Microsoft assumes that the best candidates are not looking for new jobs. In fact, candidates who approach Microsoft are actually less attractive to the company. Hiring people from big companies to little companies, top-down to bottom-up organizations, or structured to entrepreneurial settings, can be a dangerous route. Before interviewing new candidates for old jobs, it’s an excellent time to rethink the job itself. Keep your initial interview short. ### DURING Interviews test how well someone interviews. Trust your gut. Chemistry is usually determined in the first few minutes of an interview. ‘Never do business with anybody you don’t like.’ If you don’t like somebody, there’s a reason. Chances are it’s because you don’t trust them, and you’re probably right. As the official interview commences, as the starter’s gun cracks and the race begins, ask all your questions at once. That’s right. Put all your initial questions on the table up front. This strategy accomplishes three things. First, in a manner of speaking, you pass the baton. You’ve asked the questions, now the candidate must respond. Performance depends upon the candidate, not selling yourself and the organization. Second, and more importantly, this strategy directly confronts the most common problem in interviewing: not listening, and talking too much. This technique forces you to listen. Settle back and watch a candidate’s behavior as well as listen to his or her words. How do you recognize incompetence? What do you do about it? How do you recognize excellence? What do you do with it? What about yourself would you like to improve most? What makes you lose your temper? Tell me about the last time it happened. “Are you lucky?” Henry Ford’s favorite question, “Are you curious?” Disingenuous questions. “I’m just a legal and financial guy who never really understood the HR department. What exactly does a HR director do?” If the candidate could explain the job in detail, clearly and concisely, Larry went on to the next question. Watch out if the candidate spoke in jargon and buzzwords. “How are you going to lose money for me?” Three quarters of the way through the interview, give the candidate a task to perform. Not only does this demonstrate the candidate’s behavior - it also breaks the monotony of most interviews. The interviewer asks the candidate how she would market the new furniture and why. “We have about five more minutes …” is a useful statement before closure. Pay attention to “By the way …,” “Oh, one more thing …,” and “I almost forgot …,” which mean, “This is the most important thing I’m going to say.” Our strengths, in the extreme, may predict our weaknesses. Therefore ask candidates about their strengths, and consider what might exist on the other side. If candidates can go into detail and depth about a subject, they probably have some expertise in that area. If not, the opposite is true. On the other hand, the key is to ask questions in your areas of expertise. Use a pad with a line drawn down the middle. On one side of the page, make appropriate notes about what the candidate tells you regarding jobs, dates, strengths, weaknesses, etc. On the other side, note what you’re thinking. Nothing is too minor to write down: questions, missing pieces, thoughts, feelings, likes, dislikes. I have all candidates sign a release form, an at-will clause, and an arbitration agreement three times during the hiring process. They sign when they fill out an application, co-sign an employment agreement, and after they read our policy and procedures manual. ### AFTER Before a candidate leaves my office I make a simple request. “Please call me back on Monday.” I say, “You’ll probably have a few thoughts on the way home, maybe some questions, so let’s talk for five minutes, even to touch base, if you’re available by phone next week.” Then we settle on a time and day. Give finalist candidates a current project you’re evaluating and ask for an analysis. Give finalist candidates a post-interview project that evaluates attention to detail, as well as the ability to analyze problems and suggest solutions. Meet the candidate’s spouse or significant other. What worries or anxieties does that person have about the candidate’s possible job? For the candidate worried about his sick child’s health insurance, or about missing Little League practice with his son, or about his spouse’s isolation, these issues need to be addressed, fully and satisfactorily, in advance of new employment. Always have a final interview in which you talk about potential problems. If you’ve not discovered any, you’re missing something in the candidate’s background. Your goal is to address whatever difficulties might arise. Give prospective employees a fifteen-minute psychological inventory. Offer the assurance that there are no right or wrong answers. I’m not as interested in the MBTI results, which identify a candidate as one of sixteen personality types, as I am in how long it takes to return the inventory, and how the person discusses the results, which we always do by phone or in a follow-up visit. In our conversation afterward, the candidate has plenty of time to agree or disagree with the test results as it fits her personality. More significantly in terms of my task, does the candidate laugh? Does she elaborate on her independence? Her rigidities? Does she give examples? Do the results open up our discussion? Or does she clam up? Does the candidate think she can make an end run by saying, in all seriousness, as many candidates do, “Oh, I used to be like that, but I’ve really changed over the years.” ### REFERENCES Digging deeper - asking the candidate’s references for other references, Call references at what you assume will be their lunchtime - you want to reach an assistant or voice mail. Jones is a candidate for (the position) in our company. Your name has been given as a reference. Please call me back if the candidate was outstanding.” If the candidate is outstanding or excellent, I guarantee that eight out of ten people will respond quickly and want to help. Take such a response as a green light. If only two or three of the ten references selected by the candidate return your call, this message is also loud and clear. And yet: No derogatory information has been shared. No libelous statements have been made. No confidences or laws have been broken. For all references, the higher you go up an organization, the more likely you are to get helpful information. Tap the enormous wealth of publicly available data banks that may contain information on a candidate’s driving and financial records, real estate dealings, court appearances, and litigation history. Perfectly legal, this is all public information and is readily available. Always ask the candidate, “What am I likely to hear - positive and negative - when I call your references?” Candidates always deserve the courtesy of explaining the peaks and valleys of their work history. Call and ask about: 1. Technical Competence Can the candidate perform the required tasks? Can the university president raise money? Can the secretary spell? Can the receptionist handle phones? These are easy pitches, and references should be able to hit the ball out of the park. 2. Intelligence This topic can take a few seconds to consider. “On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate the candidate’s intelligence?” Most references respond well to a ten-point scale for rating people. 3. People Skills Ask about the candidate’s interpersonal skills. How does she get along with bosses? What about subordinates and peers? You’ll usually get a ringing endorsement, but listen for silences, gaps, and omissions in this part of the conversation. 4. Motivation What motivates the candidate? Financial rewards? Meaningful assignments? A job well done? Pats on the back? Independence? All of the above? I have seen candidates decline offers because of relationships (“My fiance just accepted an offer in Salt Lake”), money (“My company just beat your offer”), and educational concerns (“My daughter’s special school needs aren’t available in your city”). How you structure your offer depends upon a person’s motivations and your understanding of these motivations. 5. Everything Else Finally you should say, “Is there anything that I haven’t asked?” Then listen carefully. Here’s a second format for phone references: • Did you like the person? • What did they fail at doing? • Reputation in the company? • How did they communicate? • Reputation in the industry? • How did they react to authority? • Reason for leaving? • Level of energy, drive? • What did they accomplish? • What would you change about the person if you could? ### FINAL: It helps enormously to have a colleague you can trust - or entrust - to tell you when you’re making a mistake. Do people like working for your candidate? Contact the people who currently work for him - secretaries and administrative assistants, direct reports and coworkers. Do they revere the candidate? Or do they fear or resent him? All employees, past and present, can help predict future behavior. Give the candidate a longer assignment or hire a candidate on a temporary basis Ask three questions at once. See if the candidate remembers the questions without reminders. Give conflicting opinions early in the interview. Then see if the candidate agrees with both opinions throughout the interview.","Good advice on hiring. No big surprises, but some useful tips."
A Gift to My Children,Jim Rogers,1400067545,3,"The most common reason why people do not succeed is that their research is faulty or limited to the confines of what is immediately available. Only through meticulous research will you obtain the knowledge necessary for success. Look through each and every financial statement you can get your hands on, including the detailed notes. If you just read the annual reports of companies, you will have done more than 98 percent of investors. If you read the notes of the financial statements, you will be ahead of 99.5 percent. Verify those financial statements, as well as future projections announced by the top executives, by doing your own legwork. Talk to customers, suppliers, competitors, and anyone else who might affect the company. Do not invest unless you can say with absolute certainty that you are more knowledgeable about this particular firm than 98 percent of Wall Street analysts. Believe me, it can be done. But only with the extra effort. When investing widely in a particular nation, begin by checking the strength of the country's basic institutions. Does it have respect for the rule of law? Does it crack down on corruption? Does the legal system facilitate ethical corporate behavior? You cannot do this by simply reading articles in magazines and newspapers. You must go to the country yourself and see, for example, if there is a currency black market. If one exists, then you know that the country has problems. Black market exchange rates exist only when the government is imposing artificial controls. The difference in parity between the official currency rate and the black market rate indicates the gravity of the problem in that nation. In cases where I'm making an investment decision (or a decision about for whom to vote, et cetera), I cross-check information from the media with other available sources including government reports, international organizations, company reports, competitive views - whatever I can find. George Patton once put it, “If everyone is thinking the same thing, someone is not thinking.” If you are ever in a country that descends into war, I suggest you leave until it is over. Truth is always the first casualty of war, so you need to get your distance. Your mother and I explored moving to Shanghai or Spain, and spending time in Punta del Este, Uruguay, or Cochabamba, Bolivia. To think outside the established framework, to examine things independently - this is true philosophy. Studying philosophy trains a person to examine every concept and every “fact.” Two ways of thinking: Induction (proceeding from a specific conclusion to more general observations) Deduction (proceeding from general evidence to a specific truth) Neither method is better than the other. What is important is that you train yourself to apply both, so that you can think in a balanced way. As an investor, I am always in search of “what is bearish.” When people are crazed about an overheated market and are oblivious of other investment possibilities, that's when I find a good deal. Before you take your first overseas trip, study the history of your destinations. Without the historical context, you will not be able to fully understand much of what you observe. You can be a tourist and enjoy the scenic sites, but understanding is a far richer experience. As soon as I hear everyone making claims for something that supposedly is innovative and unprecedented, I check whether the market is overheated and often pull out my capital. Be extremely doubtful when you have people proclaiming, “It's different this time.” Historically, nothing emerges as so entirely different; such claims are indicative of a state of mass hysteria. As soon as you hear in the news about a hard landing in the Chinese economy similar to those in 1989 and 1994, consider it the best opportunity to buy into Chinese stocks or commodities. Things were growing so fast that companies could not even get more office space (a sign of trouble, I now know). Don't sell short simply because prices are high. Never sell short unless prices are astronomically expensive, and you detect negative change coming. A good rule of thumb is to sell during times of market hysteria and buy during times of panic. A cheap price alone is not sufficient reason to invest. If something is forever cheap, then it has no recognized value, and its stock may very well remain a worthless piece of paper. For a bargain to soar in price, there has to be a catalyst, and from an investment perspective, that catalyst is change. Whatever the change may be, it must have a significant impact within a country or an industry, and it must also be recognized as significant externally within a few years. If the change is real, others will notice the improvement, and prices will rise to reflect the new circumstances. New investors will catch on and prices can rise considerably for years. If you are looking for success, be quick to start something new, something that no one else has tried. And if you want to invest, look for the bear market. Many have frequently profited by investing where no one else saw potential. You can be rich if you have the courage to buy something while it is still under the radar of conventional wisdom. The more certain something is, the less likely it is to be profitable. Do not think in terms of what you wish. Never act upon wishful thinking. Anytime that you think you've become a financial genius - when, in fact, you simply have had the good luck to turn a profit - it is time to sit back and do nothing for a while. If you stumble upon success in a bull market and decide that you are gifted, stop right there. Investing at that point is dangerous, because you are starting to think like everybody else. Wait until the mob psychology that is influencing you subsides. My most successful investments were those in which I invested the most time and hard work, collecting all available information and researching every detail. If you don't understand something - I mean truly understand it - you will never be successful. Likewise, if you merely dabble in an area, you are gambling, not investing. Ignorance is born of an outsized sense of self-importance. Never let yourself become arrogant. Study hard. The more you learn, the more you will realize how little you know - and armed with this humility, you will never lose sight of the distance that separates self-confidence and self-importance. Anything that is a “must see,” “must try,” “must read,” should almost certainly be avoided, especially if it is popular. Never ask someone how much money he or she makes, or how much something costs. Never tell someone how much your things cost. Never discuss how much money you make or have. Always be early for appointments.","A nice short book of unconventional wisdom, mostly about investing."
Pomodoro Technique Illustrated,Staffan Nöteberg,1934356506,3,"You get lots of stuff done, not by focusing on getting stuff done but by focusing on focusing! ""You can't dance at two weddings with one rear end."" In other words, you should focus on one activity at a time. You will always be doing the thing that matters most and nothing else. You should change it every day to avoid doing unnecessary routines. What makes you stop an activity before you are done? Where is the best place to read to help you really focus? What do you do to avoid starting on a boring task? What type of activities usually take more time than you initially estimated? Are you bound to do administrative activities that steal time from more important activities? Since I brush my teeth every night before I go to bed, I am now sleepy already when I put toothpaste on the toothbrush. Similarly, when using the Pomodoro Technique, I have trained my brain to start to focus as soon as I wind up the kitchen timer and to drop the focus when it rings. Even the ticking sound now reinforces my concentration. Thinking, planning, and calculating future time as a duration is very unpredictable - at least when it comes to doing things that we haven't done before in the same way. For me and for most people, this property of unpredictability produces anxiety. Anxiety will most certainly lead to lower productivity and may even spoil the result. If we can treat our work effort as a chain of events, it will increase our productivity. Flow: clear goals, concentration and focus, a loss of the feeling of self-consciousness, a distorted sense of time, direct and immediate feedback, balance between ability level and challenge, a sense of personal control, intrinsically rewarding, the merging of action and awareness. Procrastination is a mechanism for coping with the anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or decision. There are three outstanding sources of procrastination: That other people force you to do something against your will Your own pressure for making a perfect performance Fear of making mistakes or receiving criticism These are the five stages that you'll follow: 1. Planning: You start the day by extracting the most important activities from your backlog - called the Activity Inventory - and writing them in a list on your To Do Today sheet. This is your commitment for the day. 2. Tracking: Once you've decided on your activities for the day, you wind up the timer for 25 minutes and then start in on the first one. During every 25-minute timebox - called a Pomodoro - you collect a small amount of process metrics. You may, for example, count the number of times that you get interrupted. 3. Recording: At the end of the day, you file your daily observations on the Records sheet. If you tracked the number of interruptions, then this number is saved here. 4. Processing: After recording, you convert the raw data into information. For example, you might calculate how many interruptions you get in an average 25-minute timebox. 5. Visualizing: Finally, you organize the information in a way that helps you see how to improve your process. This is basically a daily retrospective and when you acclimatize your working habits to your reality. Every day starts with the Planning stage and ends with Recording, Processing, and Visualizing stages. In between, there is an iterative loop of 25-minute Tracking sessions. Plan-Do-Check-Act: Plan: You define your goals and the processes you need to deliver the expected results. Do: You implement the new process. Check: You measure the new process and compare the results to the expected outcome in order to find discrepancies. Act: You analyze the discrepancies and try to understand the root cause of them. Select the most important activities from the Activity Inventory sheet and write them in a list on my To Do Today sheet. Choose the highest-priority activity on the To Do Today sheet, wind up the clock to 25 minutes, and start focusing on that Select only the number of activities that you realistically stand a chance of completing today. Selecting activities for To Do Today sheet also means that you refuse all activities that you don't write down on this list. To develop motivation, you need to extract an activity set from the inventory that is adequate for a timebox that you can foresee. If you extract this set yourself and you believe that it's an attainable goal within the timebox, then you will be committed. Rating 25 minutes of effort as a success gives us immediate feedback. Every four Pomodori, I take my set break. Typically, a set break is 15 to 30 minutes of recreation. You can even glance at your email inbox. But don't start to write any important replies. That task should be scheduled like all the other activities. Ideally, the goal of the break should be light sleep for five minutes. You should be answering these questions every day: Do I need smaller activities? Am I bothered by a recurring distraction? Do I have unnecessary overhead in my standardized activities and personal process? Doing the improvement work in a scientific way helps me remember to do it. First I standardize a practice. Then I measure the standardized practice in some way. Then I compare the metrics to the requirements. Maybe I have to change how I work to meet the requirements. Then I measure again, and finally I standardize the new, improved way of working. You can't see the big picture and focus on details at the same time. Your focus will benefit from a process where you minimize the points where you have to sort and allocate priorities. Writing the apostrophe is essentially tracking. It represents one internal interruption. At the end of the day I can count the number of apostrophes and reflect. This number is a cold hard fact of how many interruptions I had, not just a hectic feeling of forgetting something. The strategy when you get an internal interruption is to first accept it, then record it, and then immediately continue with what you were doing before you got interrupted. Take the time to look back. Then you'll see how what you thought you could do maps to what you actually achieved. Try looking at each new activity on your Activity Inventory sheet and estimating the number of Pomodori it will take to complete it. Psychologist Edward Vul showed in an experiment that averaging multiple guesses from one person about a fact provides a better estimate than any single guess. Since a Pomodoro is atomic, you can't use numbers like 1/2 or 2.2 Pomodori. A national weather service spent a gigantic amount of money on a new forecast system. All the emerging technology was included, and it had an accuracy rate of almost 70 percent. Then a clever person challenged the super machine with a much simpler algorithm. It was called Yesterday's Weather, and it said, ""Tomorrow will be like today."" Guess what? It had the same accuracy as the super machine. Estimating future achievements is basically guessing. So, why not use the history and assume it will repeat itself?","Pretty cool technique of working in 25-minute chunks. Better to start with a simple article about it, then read the book after if you love it. I do, so far."
Discover Your Inner Economist,Tyler Cowen,0452289637,3,"You can pay to have a group of “artists” kidnap and then humiliate you. In India it is possible to rent a crowd for your next public demonstration. The central concept of economics is not money but rather incentives. Quite simply, an incentive is anything that motivates human behavior, or encourages an individual to make one decision rather than another. An incentive can be money, but it can also be a tip, a smile, or an act of praise. An incentive can be a promise of lifelong devotion. Good economists believe that we live our lives according to economic principles that anyone can understand. With pieces placed on the board randomly, in no particular order, when asked to re-create the observed patterns, the masters did no better than the novices. The masters were remembering the piece placements not by having flawless memories, but by recognizing familiar patterns. We can use economics to expand our repertoire of “recognition chunks” for seeing patterns in human behavior. Steven Levitt of Freakonomics fame made his name by studying statistics about unusual or under-explored walks of life, such as crime, real estate agents, and sumo wrestling. The thirty-one U.N. diplomats from Norway and Sweden had no unpaid parking tickets over this period of time. Diplomats from Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Japan also had no unpaid parking tickets. In contrast, Kuwaiti diplomats incurred more than 246 unpaid parking violations per diplomat. Egyptian diplomats were a distant second with a mere unpaid 139.6 violations per diplomat. The next eight worst violators, in order, were: Chad, Sudan, Bulgaria, Mozambique, Albania, Angola, Senegal, and Pakistan. The higher a country ranks on indexes of domestic corruption, the higher the number of unpaid New York City parking tickets reaped by its U.N. diplomats. Offer monetary rewards when performance at a task is highly responsive to extra effort. Clerical work requires attentiveness. Filing papers in the right order is tedious, but it is within reach of most of us. We need only try to get it right. Pay us more for a good result and we will try harder. This has been confirmed by laboratory experimentation. Prizes and rewards also boost simple memory and recall skills, again provided the tasks are within the reach of most people. Prizes also motivate individuals to spot typographical errors. For the reasonably literate this task is largely a matter of vigilance. Prizes and payments also induce individuals to endure more pain. Criminals almost always perceived themselves to be in a situation of crisis. Stressed people tend to conform more to social opinion. They feel out of control and so they look to groupthink and the security blanket of other people’s approval. Too many external incentives can diminish internal motivations. When rewards and penalties will motivate, especially for simple tasks, the quality of the person matters less. Hire a drudge and pay him a bonus to file those papers. We should pay more for talent when bonuses and intrinsic motivation will work together for very high levels of effort and achievement. In these cases social status reinforces rather than displaces monetary rewards. The drive to perform really matters. The problem with Soviet communism was not just that healthy incentives were too weak, but also that bad incentives were too strong. For most people in the Soviet Union, the only way to have a decent life was to court the Communist Party. The Soviet Union offered less scope for incentive-free behavior than does capitalism. A state-controlled economy led to less play, most of all in the realm of creating and implementing new business ideas. Play was pretty much restricted to close friendships and family relations. The result was less creativity and less personal human investment in making our world a better place. Scarcity refers to the fact that most of what we want is not in free supply. Of course, some scarcities are more important than others. A good intuitive economist approaches a practical problem by asking “What is the relevant scarcity hindering a better outcome?” In every room ask yourself which picture you would take home - if you could take just one - and why. This forces us to keep thinking critically about the displays. If the alarm system was shut down and the guards went away, should I carry home the Cezanne, the Manet, or the Renoir? In a room of Egyptian antiquities, which one caught my eye? And why? We should discuss the question with our companion. At the end of the visit, ask which paintings stuck with you. Museums are not put there to make you happy. Donors do not want exactly what visitors want. Visitors want that the museum be fun and easy to use. Donors are more concerned that the museum confers status upon them in the arenas of high culture, high society, and perhaps high finance. Donors like fancy receptions, which is why museums hold them. A tragedy of the commons occurs when individual actions, taken together, destroy the value of an asset or resource. Who are the people who like just about everything, from Chinese pipa music to Bach to Algerian Rai to Stockhausen to bebop to 1920s blues? They are either musical professionals or nerdy upper-middle-class professionals, usually with some experience living abroad. That’s me. Sadly I am no less predictable than the Grand Rapids stoner. Few of us escape the need to rebel against something. This is, as you might have guessed, a way of establishing a sense of being in control. A story achieves force by linking past, present, and future events. Valuing our stories means giving credence to our past decisions and narratives; this means we will often honor sunk costs. Bygones are never truly bygones. By honoring past investments, and our past cultural attachments, we are building up a narrative and a self-image. Sometimes our current actions confer redemptive value on past actions and prove that our previous sacrifices were not in vain. We go so far as to invent new ends, so we can see our earlier investments as part of a coherent pattern. The psychological research on “status quo bias,” which shows that people tend to overvalue goods, services, and identities simply because they already own or possess them. “Hard to get” is too easy for the losers to mimic. An economic approach suggests we should insure only against catastrophes that would wipe us out. We should refuse to buy most product warranties. To get at a person’s real opinion, ask what she thinks everyone else believes. When we talk about other people, we are often talking about ourselves, whether we know it or not. Another trick for eliciting honest answers is simply to ask for advice. When people tell us what we should do, their true selves, true desires, and true worldviews come to light. Counter-signaling. The Japanese business card doesn’t suggest the person does no business; on the contrary, he is so successful and important at his work that no introduction is needed. Counter-signaling is when the very rich dress like bums. Paradoxically, reporting good news can make a person look bad. If we look anxious to reveal good news, our listeners assume that we don’t come by good news very often. Or perhaps our listeners believe we consider the good news a stroke of marvelous luck. Counter-signals work only because their users have, at some point in the past, engaged in prior signaling. Who should engage in counter-signaling? I see a rough rule of thumb. If a profession has a great deal of upside potential but low downside risk, counter-signaling should be common. When it comes to getting things done, the biggest enemy for most of us is a day spent not writing, not a day spent writing too little. If a person can write a page a day, that adds up to about a book a year, an enviable pace. Our natural tendency is to want to feel that we are taking care of everybody. We will favor policies that give us this reassurance. In the process we will often reject policies that take care of a greater number of people. If presidents, prime ministers, and popes were the only individuals who felt “they mattered,” our world would collapse. Similarly, if we are to expect the full energies and brilliance of our artists, they need to believe that their creative works are of earth-shattering social and aesthetic importance. At a fancy restaurant the menu is well thought out. The time and attention of the kitchen are scarce. An item won’t be on the menu unless there is a good reason for its presence. If it sounds bad, it probably tastes especially good. For those looking to take a food vacation, I have a recommendation. Choose a country with a great deal of inequality. It sounds heartless, but look for a big gap between the rich and the poor. Iron bars on the windows and barbed wire on the fences, however bad for the residents or for your safety, are both good signs for the food. The presence of a wealthy class of people, all other things equal, is good for food because the wealthy are a strong market for a tasty meal. That encourages quality food. But when we look at producers, a certain amount of poverty is, sad to say, likely to produce gourmet meals. The higher the level of wages at the bottom, the harder it is to employ labor to cook the food, prepare the raw ingredients, and serve and bus the tables. So the committed foodie should look to regions where some people are very rich and others are very poor. The poor people will end up cooking for the rich people. My meals in Mexico, India, and Brazil are typically delicious and cheap. Haiti, despite being the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, has some of the best food in the Caribbean. Paternalistic laws cannot be adequately enforced, or those laws create harmful and counterproductive black markets. Advice on overcoming self-control problems: cultivate a healthy self-image and a set of narratives about who you are and why it is important to contribute to society, rather than yielding to every temptation. Cornell University researcher Robert Frank asked economics students to play a variety of games for monetary prizes. The rewards the student received depended on how much he or she was willing to play noncooperative strategies at the expense of competitors. In these games, the individuals who had studied economics behaved more selfishly and less cooperatively than the control group. Furthermore a given student, after studying economics, played more selfishly than before. If you are going to give, pick the poor person who is expecting it least. Give to Bengalis who are sleeping, Bengalis who are cooking, and Bengalis who are otherwise occupied doing something from normal life. It is not hard to find very poor Bengalis engaged in all of these activities. It is quite easy to find a Bengali sleeping under a piece of cardboard. We will know we have picked the right person if the object of our generosity is totally surprised. The surprise means he or she was not eating up valuable time and energy angling for a donation. “Seed money” also encourages people to give more to charities. Seed money refers to the practice of lining up major grants in advance, before announcing a “capital campaign” to raise a certain sum of money, often as high as $100 million or more. The seed money shows that prestigious and wealthy donors are already committed to the cause. When the initial seed money is high, the subsequent fund-raising tends to go very well. One of List’s experiments found that raising seed money from 10 to 67 percent leads to a nearly sixfold increase in subsequent contributions. Like a matching grant, seed money signals that the charity is part of a powerful and noble endeavor; the charity is the winning team, so to speak. A number of charities have been buying and freeing slaves in Sudan. These activities sound virtuous, but there is a danger: if we buy out slaves, we bid up the price of slaves. In turn more victims will be enslaved. For a long time economists have debated the best way to use speculation to discourage the development of a market. The answer is counterintuitive, but it makes sense upon consideration: buy up a great deal of the item. When other sellers are ready to take their profits, dump the entire stock on the market at once, thereby lowering the price. Other market players will not receive much, if any, profit. Once the existence of this strategy becomes known, the market will wither rather than flourish. Why not leave the tip on another table, served by the same waiter, rather than on my table? So for just a moment, I put the money down on the other table. I knew the same waiter would receive it. But upon a very brief reflection I recoiled in horror and quickly grabbed the money back. That waiter would think I stiffed him. He would think badly of me. I realized I don’t care how much the waiter gets. But I did wish - strongly - to uphold my side of the dining bargain.","The book title is misleading. It ends up being mostly the author's recommendations for the transactions of life. When to give to charity, what restaurants to choose, what insurance to buy, etc. He makes a rational case for these, that is often very interesting, but still feels like just his opinion."

Every game you played, you played at top speed, sprinting like crazy as you kicked cans, freed all, and attacked jungle outposts in your neighbors’ backyards. Half the fun of doing anything was doing it at record pace, making it probably the last time in your life you’d ever be hassled for going too fast. You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom, give her all your love and attention, and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous, and follow you. “Let us live so that when we come to die, even the undertaker will be sorry,” Mark Twain used to say. Zatopek found a way to run so that when he won, even other teams were delighted. The most advanced weapon in the ultrarunner’s arsenal: instead of cringing from fatigue, you embrace it. You refuse to let it go. You get to know it so well, you’re not afraid of it anymore. The only way to truly conquer something, as every great philosopher and geneticist will tell you, is to love it. No wonder your feet are so sensitive. They’re self-correcting devices. Covering your feet with cushioned shoes is like turning off your smoke alarms. Runners who stretched were 33 percent more likely to get hurt. Your legs and feet instinctively come down hard when they sense something squishy underfoot. When you run in cushioned shoes, your feet are pushing through the soles in search of a hard, stable platform. The best injury-prevention advice he’s ever heard came from a coach who advocated “running barefoot on dewy grass three times a week.” Next time your feet are sore, walk on slippery stones in a cold creek. Unbelievable! Clipped a small electric metronome to his T-shirt. “What’s this for?” “Set it for one hundred eighty beats a minute, then run to the beat.” “You ever see one of those barefoot guys in a 10K race?” “Yeah. It’s like they’re running on hot coals.” Imagine your kid is running into the street and you have to sprint after her in bare feet. You’ll automatically lock into perfect form - you’ll be up on your forefeet, with your back erect, head steady, arms high, elbows driving, and feet touching down quickly on the forefoot and kicking back toward your butt. Eric also had me get a heart-rate monitor so I could correct the second-most common mistake of the running class - pace. Most of us are just as clueless about speed as we are about form. “Nearly all runners do their slow runs too fast, and their fast runs too slow,” Ken Mierke says. “So they’re just training their bodies to burn sugar, which is the last thing a distance runner wants. You’ve got enough fat stored to run to California, so the more you train your body to burn fat instead of sugar, the longer your limited sugar tank is going to last.” The way to activate your fat-burning furnace is by staying below your aerobic threshold - your hard-breathing point - during your endurance runs. Tip for managing heart rate and pace: “Only go as fast as you can while holding a conversation.” Because it’s a low-fat, whole-grain food, pinole can slash your risk of diabetes and a host of digestive-system cancers - in fact, of all cancers. According to Dr. Robert Weinberg, a professor of cancer research at MIT and discoverer of the first tumor-suppressor gene, one in every seven cancer deaths is caused by excess body fat. The math is stark: cut the fat, and cut your cancer risk. Pinole isn’t as hard to get as you think. Nativeseeds.org sells it online, along with heritage seeds in case you want to grow your own corn and whiz up some homemade pinole in a coffee grinder. “Grow some wild geranium,” he suggested. “Or buy the extract online.” Geranium niveum is the Tarahumara wonder drug; according to the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, it’s as effective as red wine at neutralizing disease-causing free radicals. As one writer put it, wild geranium is “anti-everything - anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antioxidant.” Under her Tarahumara-style eating plan, lunch and dinner were built around fruit, beans, yams, whole grains, and vegetables, and breakfast was often salad. “You get leafy greens in your body first thing in the morning and you’ll lose a lot of weight,” she urged me. Because a monster salad is loaded with nutrient-rich carbs and low in fat, I could stuff myself and not feel hungry - or queasy - when it came time to work out. “Your body needs to be shocked to become resilient,” Eric explained. Follow the same daily routine, and your musculoskeletal system quickly figures out how to adapt and go on autopilot. But surprise it with new challenges - leap over a creek, commando-crawl under a log, sprint till your lungs are bursting - and scores of nerves and ancillary muscles are suddenly electrified into action. Instead of stretching before a run, I got right to work. Lunges, pushups, jump squats, crunches; Eric had me powering through a half hour of raw strength drills every other day, with nearly all of them on a fitness ball to sharpen my balance and fire those supportive ancillary muscles. Early humans had separated themselves from all creation by taking their knuckles off the ground and standing up. It was to breathe! To open their throats, swell out their chests, and suck in air better than any other creature on the planet. Women have really been underrated. They’ve been evolutionarily shortchanged. We perpetuate this notion that they were sitting around waiting for the men to come back with food, but there’s no reason why women couldn’t be part of the hunting party.

Enough,John Bogle,0470398515,3,"“I have something he will never have... enough.” Old epigram from nineteenth-century Great Britain: Some men wrest a living from nature and with their hands; this is called work. Some men wrest a living from those who wrest a living from nature and with their hands; this is called trade. Some men wrest a living from those who wrest a living from those who wrest a living from nature and with their hands; this is called finance. The wonderful magic of compounding returns has been overwhelmed by the powerful tyranny of compounding costs. Investing is all about the long-term ownership of businesses. Speculation is precisely the opposite. It is all about the short-term trading, not long-term holding, of financial instruments—pieces of paper, not businesses—largely focused on the belief that their prices, as distinct from their intrinsic values, will rise. Keynes defined investment - he called it “enterprise” - as “forecasting the prospective yield of an asset over its entire life.” He defined speculation as “the activity of forecasting the market.” In the very long run, all of the returns earned by stocks are created not by speculation but by investment. The message is clear: In the long run, stock returns have depended almost entirely on the reality of the relatively predictable investment returns earned by business. The totally unpredictable perceptions of market participants, reflected in momentary stock prices and in the changing multiples that drive speculative returns, essentially have counted for nothing. It is economics that controls long-term equity returns; the impact of emotions, so dominant in the short term, dissolves. Therefore, as I wrote in my Little Book of Common Sense Investing, “the stock market is a giant distraction from the business of investing.” In the real market of business, real companies spend real money and hire real people and invest in real capital equipment, to make real products and provide real services. If they compete with real skill, they earn real profits, out of which they pay real dividends. But to do so demands real strategy, real determination, and real capital expenditures, to say nothing of requiring real innovation and real foresight. In the expectations market, by contrast, prices are set, not by the realities of business just described, but by the expectations of investors. Crucially, these expectations are set by numbers, numbers that are to an important extent the product of what our managements want them to be, too easily managed, manipulated, and defined in multiple ways. When the perception—interim stock prices—vastly departs from the reality—intrinsic corporate values—the gap can be reconciled only in favor of reality. It is simply impossible to raise reality to perception in any short time frame; the tough and demanding task of building corporate value in a competitive world is a long-term proposition. Still, whenever stock prices lose touch with corporate values and bubbles begin to form, too many market participants seem to anticipate that values will soon rise to justify prices, instead of the other way around. The brilliant 2001 memoir, On Money and Markets, by economist and investor Henry Kaufman, one of the wisest of all the wise men in Wall Street’s long history. Innovation in finance is designed largely to benefit those who create the complex new products, rather than those who own them. Returns to expect from simple, broadly diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds over the next decade are 7 and 5 percent, respectively. Warren Buffett: “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.” Warren Buffett: “There are three i’s in every cycle: first the innovator, then the imitator, and finally the idiot.” Commodities have no internal rate of return. Their prices are based entirely on supply and demand. That is why they are considered speculations. The aggregate profits of our corporations are closely linked, indeed almost in lock-step, with the growth of our economy. It has been a rare year when corporate profits accounted for less than 4.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), and profits only rarely account for as much as 9 percent. Indeed, since 1929, after-tax profits have grown at an average rate of 5.6 percent annually, actually lagging the 6.6 percent growth rate of the GDP. In a dog-eat-dog capitalistic economy where the competition is vigorous and largely unfettered and where the consumer is king, how could the profits of corporate America possibly grow faster than our GDP? When corporations fail to meet their numeric targets the hard way—over the long term... by raising productivity by improving old products and creating new ones by providing services on a more friendly, more timely, and more efficient basis by challenging the people of the organization to work more effectively together (and those are the ways that our best corporations achieve success) ... they are compelled to do it in other ways: ways that often subtract value from you, from me, and from society. Vow: “I will create value for society, rather than extract it.” Since 1950, direct ownership of U.S. stocks by individual investors has plummeted from 92 percent to 26 percent, while indirect ownership by institutional investors has soared from 8 percent to 74 percent. The trite bromide “If you can measure it, you can manage it” has been a hindrance. How can we possibly measure the qualities of human existence that give our lives and careers meaning? How about grace, kindness, and integrity? What value do we put on passion, devotion, and trust? How much do cheerfulness, the lilt of a human voice, and a touch of pride add to our lives? Tell me, please, if you can, how to value friendship, cooperation, dedication, and spirit. Beware of the apparently easy shortcuts of life. If a job is to be done, best to do it right. Joseph Schumpeter: In his Theory of Economic Development, written nearly a century ago, Schumpeter dismissed material and monetary gain as the prime mover of the entrepreneur, finding motivations like these to be far more powerful: (1) The joy of creating, of getting things done, of simply exercising one’s energy and ingenuity (2) The will to conquer: the impulse to fight... to succeed for the sake, not of the fruits of success, but of success Benjamin Franklin’s creation of a mutual insurance company was the classic example of his community-minded approach to entrepreneurship. He also founded a library, an academy and college, a hospital, and a learned society—none for his personal enrichment, all for the benefit of his community. Benjamin Franklin believed that “Knowledge is not the personal property of its discoverer, but the common property of all. As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours, and this we should do freely and generously.” He ultimately listed 13 virtues—including temperance, silence, order, frugality, industry, sincerity, and justice—even ranking them in order of importance. He began each day with “The Morning Question: What Good shall I do this day?” and ended with “The Evening Question: What Good have I done today?” Bill George book: Authentic Leadership Ask ourselves whether we’re chasing the fake rabbit of success or the real rabbit of meaning, defined by the contributions to our society that stem from principle, virtue, and character. No career is the right career if it is undertaken solely to get rich, or to gain public fame, or to throw one’s weight around. Nor is it the right career if it is undertaken to meet the expectations of others. And no success is the right success if it is achieved at society’s expense. René Descartes reminded us four full centuries ago, “A man is incapable of comprehending any argument that interferes with his revenue.” Albert Schweitzer got it exactly right. “Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.” It’s not money that determines our happiness, but the presence of some combination of these three attributes: (1) autonomy, the extent to which we have the ability to control our own lives, “to do our own thing” (2) maintaining connectiveness with other human beings, in the form of love of our families, our pleasure in friends and colleagues, and an openness with those we meet in all walks of life (3) exercising competence, using our God-given and self-motivated talents, inspired and striving to learn I'll leave some resources behind for my six children (enough so that they can do anything they want, but not enough that they can do nothing). Each of us who prospers in this great republic has a solemn obligation to recognize his or her good fortune by giving something back.","Legendary investor, now 80, looks back with long-view wisdom on investing, living, and giving."
How to be a Billionaire,Martin Fridson,82189439,3,"The less-informed parties who wind up on the short end are not the ones who subsequently write autobiographies recounting their ascent to billionaire status. The one objective that ties them all together: Overcome the levelers. You must vanquish the mighty economic and social forces that conspire against your rise to massive wealth. The levelers against which you must struggle are the Menace of Competition and the Obstacle of Social Conventions. If you succumb to them, you will never rise above a comparatively modest level of wealth. Entrepreneurs trapped in this system may prosper through general growth in the economy, but they will not become fabulously wealthy. To pull out of the pack, they must earn much higher profits than the economy as a whole is generating. In short, if you hope to become a billionaire, you must overcome the scourge of competition, one way or another. Lawful Sources of Pricing Power 1. Brand identity 2. Patent protection 3. Dominant market share 4. Sustainable cost advantage In Walton's case, the key to obtaining lower costs was a willingness to violate the retailing industry norm of cordial relations with vendors. Wal-Mart deviated even further from convention when it tried to go around manufacturers' representatives to deal directly with manufacturers. Do not waste energy on the leveling tones of latter-day socialists who consider it a crime to get rich. Ignore, as well, the envious types who call you greedy. New ideas have given birth to many immense fortunes, but the original thinkers have not generally been the ones who made the fortunes. A more dependable strategy is to learn how to make money from ideas, and then be prepared to capitalize on an original notion dreamed up by someone who is more skilled at that sort of thing. Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart, prided himself on having appropriated nearly all of his good ideas from his competitors. More than any of the other retailing magnates, however, Walton thoroughly understood how to turn ideas into dollars. You will not reach even the hundred-million-dollar level without a clear focus and single-minded commitment. The best odds of becoming a billionaire, in summary, exist in industries that ride the key trends of economic development. This suggests that in newly industrializing countries, great opportunities may remain in infrastructure and basic industries. In the world's most developed economies, however, the cream of tomorrow's billionaires probably will emerge from communications, services, and technology. The entrepreneur who pulls away from the pack in a young industry has a genuine shot at a billion-dollar net worth. Overcome the leveling effects of competition by applying superior management skills or investing in political influence. • Take Extraordinary Risks • Do Business in a New Way • Dominate Your Market • Consolidate an Industry • Buy Low • Thrive on Deals • Outmanage the Competition • Invest in Political Influence • Resist the Unions • Pursue the Money in Ideas • Rules Are Breakable • Copying Pays Better Than Innovating • Keep on Growing • Hold on to Your Equity • Hard Work Is Essential • Use Financial Leverage • Keep the Back Door Open • Make Mistakes, Then Learn from Them • Frugality Pays • Enjoy the Pursuit • Develop a Thick Skin He first asked a farmer to name a price for the drilling rights on his land. Then, Hunt hurried to town and offered the rights to an oil driller at a higher price. Once he had both sides of the trade in place, he would buy and sell nearly simultaneously, pocketing a profit without risking a nickel. The route chosen by Perot and Walton, requires exceptional resistance to the levelers. If you sincerely want to be superrich, you cannot let yourself be deterred by the unavoidable fact that change upsets people. Along with his keen instinct for turning a profit, a key ingredient in Perot's success was his ability to build an organization. He recruited self-starters like himself and let them operate with a minimum of bureaucratic rules. World's shortest procedural manual: ""Do what makes sense."" Adopting the motto ""whatever it takes,"" they put in excruciatingly long hours on projects that sometimes kept them away from home for months at a time. His methods represent a veritable checklist of the techniques that can be culled from studying the careers of the most successful moneymakers. In most cases, he carried the concept far beyond limits that ordinary mortals would find reasonable. ""What sets us apart,"" Walton said in explaining Wal-Mart's success, ""is that we train people to be merchants. We let them see all the numbers so they know exactly how they're doing within the store and within the company; they know their cost, their markup, their overhead, and their profit."" Success is more likely to accrue to people who find intrinsic satisfaction in the accumulation of wealth, as opposed to the possession of wealth. • Dominate Your Market • Do Business in a New Way • Take Monumental Risks • Consolidate an Industry.

This term refers to the tactic of announcing a software product before it exists, typically to discourage rivals from proceeding with development of competing versions. High-growth industries that most often spawn vast personal fortunes tend to be characterized by fierce struggles for survival. No one islikely to emerge from such battles without a willingness to push the envelope. Like Sam Walton, Gates exemplifies the success achievable by those who do not fall victim to the not-invented-here syndrome. Don't be too proud to take advantage of undeserved good fortune. Operated within the services category, favoring rental businesses that generate recurring revenues. ""If I rent something,"" he explains, ""basically I'm selling the same thing over and over again."" He was eager to move on, spurred less by the trappings of wealth than by the challenge of increasing it. ""Wayne always keeps the carrot far enough out in front of him and he never really wants to catch it,"" observes Dean Buntrock. ""That's his personality. He's never satisfied."" He once remarked that auto sales and rentals represented a trillion-dollar market and that he only wanted his fair share: half. Associates report being sent back to the negotiating table 15 times or more until they emerge with terms that satisfy him. ""A deal,"" Huizenga once told an interviewer, with a smile, ""it's like chasing a girl. You work at it until she says yes."" Determined to realize his vast ambitions, Huizenga labored hard to master his emotions and channel his immense energy productively. What could be less complicated than purchasing an asset when nobody wants it, then selling it when no one can live without it? ""If it's truly as simple as that, why isn't everybody rich?"" The standard answer offered by financial gurus is that most investors lose their nerve when they see the crowd rushing toward the exit. Proactive behavior is one common theme to watch for as you read the following sketches of champion bargain hunters. Observe as well the two distinct ways in which billionaires squeeze pennies until they scream. Not only do they pay as little as possible for the assets they buy, but they relentlessly strive to reduce the operating costs of their properties. Meanwhile, in 1929, the stock market crashed. While others despaired, Getty recognized the debacle as a golden opportunity to satisfy his predilection for paying bottom dollar. Thanks to the plunge in oil company shares, petroleum could be found more cheaply on Wall Street than in the oil patch. ""It was foolish,"" Getty reasoned, ""to buy oil properties with 100-cent dollars when you could buy them indirectly with maybe 50-cent dollars. Laurence Tisch's immense wealth derives mainly from buying low and selling high. Observers commonly overlook the negotiating skill that has enabled him to obtain bargains that otherwise might have gone to his rivals. A typical assessment runs along these lines: To triumph as often as he has, Tisch has thumbed his nose at conventional wisdom. He buys companies or stocks when they are wildly unpopular and shuns anything that is remotely in vogue. In many such comments over the years, the press has celebrated Tisch's knack for finding value, while obscuring his effectiveness in adding value. Buying when others appear to be panicking sometimes proves nothing except that there was good reason to panic. Buffett has not merely bought some shares of a company he likes, but instead has acquired a controlling interest. Buffett enhanced the value of his investments by becoming an active member of the board of directors. He began buying entire businesses near the beginning of his stint as a money manager, long before his assets were great enough An insurance company's potential as the base of an industrial empire has three sources, namely: • Use of funds that will eventually belong to others. • Tax benefits. • Financial leverage. The opportunity to use other people's money arises from cash reserves created by insurance premiums. Eventually, the reserves must be paid out in claims, but until then, the insurance company can invest the funds. Moreover, the earnings generated by those investments are heavily tax-favored. The third benefit of investing through an insurance company, financial leverage, arises from the ability to generate annual premiums several times as great as the equity invested in the business. Consider, for example, a company capitalized with $200 million and generating $800 million of annual premiums. If the insurer earns 6 percent on the resulting investment portfolio of $1 billion, or $60 million, its return on investment (before expenses and taxes) is $60 million over $200 million, or 30 percent. When one reads that ""Warren Buffett"" has bought, [for example], an interest in General Foods, it usually means that an insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway using its reserves built up against future claims-has made the investment, which can cost more than Berkshire Hathaway, the parent company, could readily afford. He did not immerse himself in day-to-day operations. By and large, Buffett relies on strong managers who share his passion for return on investment. A bad business usually prevails over a good management. Buffett downplays the importance of IQ in material success, stressing instead the importance of character and drive. Fair enough, but there are several different proven strategies for turning those traits into billion-dollar fortunes. Not all of them require exceptional intellectual capacity. To the extent that Buffett's success has relied on discerning superior values among stocks being scrutinized by millions of other investors, on the other hand, brainpower has been an invaluable asset. This is a fact worth considering as you try to match your own talents to a specific strategy for reaching the billion-dollar circle. ""The big print giveth and the fine print taketh away."" - Bishop Fulton J. Sheen There are several different ways to realize value in buying and selling businesses. Negotiating favorable prices, both on the way in and on the way out, is only the most obvious. Another means of maximizing the gain on the round trip is to finance the purchase on advantageous terms. Further gains are achievable from increasing the asset's value, following its purchase, through capable management. Not to be ignored, either, is the compensation that can be extracted during the ownership/management phase. By exploiting all these profit sources in every transaction, and by doing many transactions, it is possible to amass a sizable fortune. Identifying the opportunities requires a keen sense of where the deals are at a given time. Clues can be found in the economic environment, the state of the capital markets, and conditions in various industries. Essential to astute deal making, as well, is a grasp of complex transactions in which one side may wind up with a subtle, but ultimately decisive, edge. Tenacity, willingness to risk a huge loss, and creativity in forging agreements are recurring themes. Wayne Huizenga's creation of Waste Management: In acquiring independent waste haulers, he minimized the haggling over price by beginning at a level within 5 or 10 percent of the maximum that he would pay. Then, he would focus the discussion on such issues as the tax benefits of taking Waste Management stock in payment and the seller's ongoing relationship as an operator. Wayne was famous for, ""Do the deal now for $100, do it tomorrow for $90."" Huizenga sought to get deals completed quickly. His team would begin negotiating on Monday morning and work 18 hours a day, seven days a week, until the transaction closed. He stuck rigorously to two rules: Wayne Huizenga's Cardinal Rules for Closing Deals 1. Don't lose a deal by failing to pay attention to it 2. Never talk about a deal until it is signed Deal making on the scale that produces billionaires requires nerves of steel. At one time or another, the three superb negotiators profiled in this chapter have all been in tight spots, facing potential bankruptcy. If they did not enjoy the rush of adrenaline that accompanies a successful deal, they could not have pursued the deal maker's route to massive wealth accumulation. To replicate their success, you too will have to learn to love the deals for their own sake. Kerkorian employed a core billionaires' technique of sidestepping petty regulations. Kerkorian lost his investment. He resolved not to invest thereafter in a business he did not run. The impetus behind Kirk Kerkorian's success has been his restlessness. The wide variety of businesses he has engaged in supports his claim that he started out with no specific ambition. ""I just tend to get dissatisfied easily and want to do something else,"" he once explained. Day-to-day operations hold little appeal for him, but buying and selling companies clearly does, even when incumbent management fights him tooth and nail. Thriving in the high-stakes environment he relishes requires a strong stomach for fluctuations in fortune. In his first go-around with MGM alone, Kerkorian came close to being wiped out on three separate occasions. If (weaker people) got into the kind of situation Kirk got into they'd blow their brains out or just fall to pieces. Kirk goes right back in there and says, ""Well, what can we do here? Let's start working on it."" It was impossible to deal with Icahn. Every time he thought he had reached an agreement, Icahn would come back to the negotiating table with a new wrinkle or a revised number that altered the terms radically in his favor. He delighted in extracting one wage concession after another. When a transportation officer admitted he did not know the whereabouts of a customer's overdue shipment, Moyers snarled, ""Well, you'd better know tomorrow or you won't have a job."" Soon after arriving at Southern Pacific, Moyers called together 27 vice presidents and told them that within two months many of them would be gone. The meeting was over. The transaction created the nation's largest railroad and left Phil Anschutz as its largest shareholder. Now it was time for him to go into high gear by applying the billionaires' principle ""Keep on Growing."" An ordinary entrepreneur might have simply declared victory after parlaying $90 million into $1.4 billion, but not Anschutz. While cashing in his railroad investment, he held on to a fiber-optics operation he had constructed along the Southern Pacific's rights-of-way. The company, Qwest Communications International, went public less than a year after the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger cleared its last regulatory hurdle. Within six months, the stock had risen by about 175 percent. The 85 percent stake that Anschutz retained was valued at $3.5 billion; his initial investment in the venture amounted to only $55 million. Phil is very astute in analyzing what it is that is going to be the next most important business or marketplace. He takes advantage of his assets in ways most other people don't. Like most successful deal makers, Anschutz showed a keen eye for value from his earliest days. He was only 27 when he learned of a collection of western art in the basement of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway's Chicago headquarters. The railroad had originally commissioned the paintings as models for travel posters. Managing to gain an interview with the company's chairman, Anschutz offered to catalog the largely forgotten works in exchange for the right to purchase a few. The 85 paintings that he bought for a song a few days later were eventually valued at several million dollars. ""It's important to have your back to the wall,"" Phil Anschutz commented, recollecting the oil-field fire. ""It teaches you how to think outside the box."" Sheer determination has been a consistent theme of the marathon runner's long-run success in amassing wealth. He lays down his stipulations and then won't budge. He's a smart guy out to make a buck. The amount he's already made doesn't matter. It would be inaccurate to characterize the subjects of How to Be a Billionaire as hands-on managers. Getting bogged down in operational details would have diverted their attention from the more essential task of amassing personal wealth. Instead, they have focused on three essential aspects of management: organization, recruitment, and motivation. Group-thinkers have not cracked the Forbes 400 in significant numbers for one simple reason: Doing the same thing in the same way as everyone else is decidedly not the way to overcome the leveling effects of competition. Outorganizing the competition, in contrast, is one proven method of breaking away from the pack. The opportunity arises precisely because of certain maladies that give the word ""organization"" a negative connotation. Companies that exhibit the following sorts of behavior become sitting ducks for rivals that can respond quickly and effectively to an evolving competitive environment: • Long lines of communication keep senior management unaware of changes in the marketplace. • Fear of rocking the boat discourages employees from coming forward with worthwhile ideas. • Primary focus on avoiding mistakes deters managers from taking risks. • Obsession with defending turf diverts managers from capitalizing on business opportunities. What makes the self-made billionaires' knack for building effective companies distinctive has little to do with the formal elements, such as organizational charts and performance measurement. It is more a matter of giving their organizations the stamp of their invariably strong personalities. Most self-made billionaires have preferred to focus on more lucrative activities. By swinging more deals and overcoming the leveling effect of competition, they have become far wealthier than managers who were much more adept at handling the details. John D. Rockefeller Sr. hired talented people whenever he found them, rather than according to need, confident that Standard Oil's growth would create many spots to fill. He recognized talent even in opponents. Perot put extraordinary effort into evaluating new hires. He devised a 20-page application that asked candidates, among other questions, what they considered the greatest accomplishments of their lives. He met with the wives of the candidates, exploring whether they would tolerate the demands that EDS would put on their husbands. In the early days, a candidate did not get hired before interviewing with every single existing EDS employee. While Microsoft has attracted aggressively intellectual types characterized as clones of Bill Gates, Sam Walton's top aides were typically ambitious small-town men like himself. Wayne Huizenga's senior managers have tended to be former football players with middle-class, Midwestern backgrounds. Ross Perot created EDS in his own image by hiring hard chargers with military backgrounds. In recruiting people who shared their views of the world, however, the billionaires did not seek yes-men. Confident enough not to feel threatenedby strong subordinates, they generally valued aides who were willing to defend opposing points of view. Gates estimates that he devotes 70 percent of his time to review meetings with small product development teams. The main reason for taking Perot Systems public in 1999, he says, was to motivate employees. ""I want them to know what their work has produced in the way of value. Nothing motivates a team like having them have stock."" The personal loyalty that Perot commanded by taking a direct interest in his employees' lives. • Attract managers with enough self-confidence to challenge your own judgment on matters. • Delegate authority to detail-oriented executives who can free you to concentrate on billion-dollar ideas. • Stay close enough to operations to be aware of problems and opportunities, making sure that your lieutenants follow up on suggestions for improvement. • Constantly reinforce a focus on controlling costs. • Use equity incentives to provide your managers and other key employees a realistic chance to become millionaires. • Show genuine, personal concern for people within your organization. • Promote morale by maintaining a sense of fun along with seriousness of purpose. Branson motivates employees to excel by putting them into slightly higher positions than they expect. Like Kirk Kerkorian, Branson has no difficulty delegating day-to-day operations, much preferring to spend his time on new ventures. As long as a business is doing well, he does not bother to meet with management, while making himself available for crises. ""He's only interested in the chase of the deal-at the point he feels he has it locked up, he loses interest in the details."" Associates of consummate deal maker Wayne Huizenga describe him in similar terms. You will have to supplement your native talent with acquired skills. To become an outstanding builder of organizations, Wayne Huizenga had to correct an early tendency to be curt toward people who did not grasp points he considered self-evident. Intimidated by this reaction, employees would sometimes fail to pass along important information. Ross Perot and Sam Walton had to revise their original inclination to reward only senior managers generously, which caused lower-level employees to feel like second-class citizens. This sort of adaptability is one of the most important traits that you should strive to stamp on your organization. ""Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort."" - Franklin D. Roosevelt An analysis of the great fortunes founded since the nineteenth century showed you that they greatly improved their chances by focusing their energies in high-growth industries. You then studied the nine fundamental strategies that the self-made billionaires pursued: • Take Monumental Risks • Do Business in a New Way • Dominate Your Market • Consolidate an Industry • Buy Low • Thrive on Deals • Outmanage the Competition • Invest in Political Influence • Resist the Unions The billionaires' stories showed you the extraordinary power of the following key principles: • Pursue the Money in Ideas • Rules Are Breakable • Copying Pays Better Than Innovating • Keep on Growing • Hold on to Your Equity • Hard Work Is Essential • Use Financial Leverage • Keep the Back Door Open • Make Mistakes, Then Learn from Them • Frugality Pays • Enjoy the Pursuit • Develop a Thick Skin Genuinely resolving to become a billionaire means committing yourself wholeheartedly to the goal. It requires a dedication no less intense than training to swim the English Channel. Making up your mind to be superrich means subordinating other goals to an all-consuming quest for wealth. You will not prosper by performing any activity in a perfunctory way, regardless of whether it has to do with making money. Far from distracting you from the goal of becoming superrich, intensely applying yourself to other aspects of your life will cultivate the habit of excelling. Bill Gates's intensity extends beyond the workplace. When he was dating Ann Winblad, another pioneer in the computer software industry, the couple chose motifs for the brief vacations they could spare the time to take. On a physics-themed vacation, for example, they read as many books on the subject as they could pack and listened to recordings of a lecture series by Richard Feynman. To perform like a champion, you also have to outflank thousands of competitors who are perspiring every bit as profusely as you are. To avoid being leveled out with the rest of them, you must do something different. You have to contemplate bigger risks, try unorthodox business strategies, or raise the ante in making deals. It is all right to copy someone else's idea, but you have to execute it better. Ordinary efforts and conventional approaches do not produce extraordinary wealth.","Biographical look at billionaires from the last 200 years, and lessons learned from how they did it. Some lessons aren't really applicable to the rest of us, like changing government laws to protect your monopoly. But some are."
Reality Check,Guy Kawasaki,1591842239,3,"Mantra: 3 or 4 words that explain why your company should exist. Read The Stragegy Paradox by Michael Raynor. Entrepreneurs are apt to stick with a flawed business plan they spent months drafting. The executive summary is the most important part. It must be fantastic, eyeball sucking, and pulse altering. Explain why your product is curve jumping, paradigm shifting, and revolutionary. The more important reason to write a business plan is to force the management team to solidify the objectives (what), strategies (how), and tactics (where, when, who). When you write your plan, act as if you know exactly what you're going to do. You are deliberate. As you execute the plan, be flexible and fast-moving. Set measurable goals. 3-5 goals measured on a weekly basis are plenty. Achievable: take 10% of your forecast, make this your goal, and blow it away. Postpone touchy-feely goals. Companies that reach on measurable goals are happy. Communicate: Employees should wake up in the morning thinking about how they're going to help achieve these goals. Good employees accept responsibility. Great employees seek responsibility. Follow through on an issue until it is done. Reward the achievers. Serve notice to everyone that ""this person delivered"". Establish a culture of execution in the early days. The CEO should set an example of meeting goals, responding to customers, and heeding and measuring employees. This obsession should include the CEO's answering emails and responding to phone calls. When your product is ""good enough"", get it out, because cash flows when you start shipping.

Fooled by Randomness,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,1400067936,3,"POSSIBLE WORLDS: (risk and uncertainty) Consider all possible parallel paths of outside effects : janitor who won the lottery would have had 999,999 lives with unsuccessful lottery tickets, and one possible life winning. Whereas a dentist who followed the dental-school and self-practice path has a smaller range of possibilities : ranging only from a dentist practice for poor people versus a dentist practice for rich people. Challenge the notion that probability is about what may happen in the future, not events in the observed past - that an event that has already taken place has 100% probability. $10 million earned playing Russian Roulette does not have the same value as $10 million earned through the diligent and artful practice of dentistry. One's dependence on randomness is greater. The higher-up the corporate ladder, the lower the evidence of contribution. The degree of randomness in an activity : someone ""lower"" who does something well repeatedly wrongly gets less credit than the CEO who might have made one or two good decisions. The difference between someone who goes to Vegas, puts a single coin in a machine and wins $1 million. You can be sure if that same person put one million $1 bets, they would not have come out as well. This is the core of sampling theory : ""the law of large numbers"". MEDIA INFLUENCE: The market movements in the 18 months after September 11 were far smaller than the ones in the 18 months prior - but somehow in the minds of investors they were very volatile. Discussions in the media of the ""terrorist threats"" magnified the effect of the market moves in people's heads. This is one of the many reasons that journalism may be the greatest plague we face today. Conventional wisdom favors things that can be explained instantly and in a nutshell. Most poetic sounding adages are plain wrong. Einstein said common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age 18. What sounds intelligent is suspicious. Almost all the smart things that have been proven by science appeared like lunacies at the time they were first discovered. A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point. SURVIVAL OF THE LEAST FIT: At a given time in the market, the most successful traders are likely to be those that are best fit to the latest cycle. This does not happen too often with dentists or pianists because these professions are more immune to randomness. Regime switch : all attributes of a system change, to the point of becoming unrecognizable. Darwinian fitness applies over a very long time. Time aggregation eliminates much of the effects of randomness/noise. Things balance out over the long run. We do not live in a world where things ""converge"" continuously toward betterment. Things in life don't move continuously at all. The longer animals go without encountering the rare event, the more vulnerable they will be to it. MARKET FOOLS OF RANDOMNESS CONSTANTS: * - An overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs in some measure, either economic or statistical. (Not considering it is coincidence.) * - A tendency to get married to positions. (Loyalty to ideas is not a good thing for anyone.) * - The tendency to change their story. (To explain foolish behavior.) * - No precise game plan ahead of time as to what to do in the event of losses. * - Absence of critical thinking expressed in absence of revision of their stance with ""stop losses"". (No allowance for flaws.) * - Denial. (No clear acceptance of what has happened. Ignoring the message from reality.) SKEWNESS: ""Skewed bets"" : I try to benefit from rare events, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently, but present a large payoff when they occur. I try to make money as infrequently as possible, because I believe the rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price. We read too much into shallow recent history, with statements like ""this has never happened before"". (Things that never happened before in one area tend eventually to happen.) History teaches us that things that never happened before do happen. People tend to be sensitive to the presence or absence of a given stimulus rather than its magnitude. A loss is first perceived as just a loss, with further implications later. Same with profits. The agent would prefer the number of losses to be low and the number of gains to be high, rather than optimizing the total performance. We take past history as a single homogeneous sample and believe we have considerably increased our knowledge of the future from the observation of the sample of the past. What if things have changed? If rational traders detect a pattern of stocks rising on Mondays, then immediately such a pattern becomes detectable, it would be ironed out by people buying on Friday. There is no point searching for patterns that are available to everyone. Once detected, they would be self-cancelling. If you expect Arizona weather to be 60 degrees -+ 10, that's quite different than Chicago weather being 60 degrees -+ 30. My activity in the market depends far less on where I think the market or the random variable is going so much as it does on the degree of error I allow around such a confidence level. THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION: George Soros knew how to handle randomness by keeping a critical open mind and changing his opinions with minimal shame. (Which carries the side effect of making him treat people like napkins.) Karl Popper says science is not to be taken as seriously as it sounds. There are only two types of theories: 1. Theories that are known to be wrong, as they were tested and adequately rejected. 2. Theories that have not yet been known to be wrong, not falsified yet, but are exposed to be proved wrong. Why is a theory never right? Because we will never know if all the swans are white. (Story of how it was believed as fact that all swans are white, until a black swan was discovered hundreds of years later.) I speculate in all of my activities on theories that represent some vision of the world, but with the following stipulation: no rare event should harm me. In fact, I would like all conceivable rare events to help me. LOSER TAKES ALL: The larger the deviation from the norm, the larger the probability of it coming from luck rather than skills. I wonder if those ""experts"" who make foolish and self-serving statements like ""markets will always go up in any 20-year period"" are aware of this problem of randomness. Real randomness does not look random. Like actors into stardom, people patronize whatother people like to do. Forcing rational dynamics on the process would be impossible. This is called a ""path dependent outcome"" and has thwarted many mathematical attempts at modeling behavior. Imagine practicing piano every day, barely able to perform ""Chopsticks"", then suddenly finding yourself capable of playing Rachmaninov. People cannot comprehend the nonlinear nature of the rare event. There are routes to success that are nonrandom, but very few people have the mental stamina to follow them. Those who go the extra mile are rewarded. In trading, one may own a security that benefits from lower market prices, but may not react at all until some critical point. Most people give up before the rewards. Too much success is the enemy (think of the punishment delt to the rich and famous) - and too much failure is demoralizing. I would like the option of having neither. THE GOOD SIDE OF RANDOMNESS: Imagine a donkey equally hungry and thirsty, standing exactly between sources of food and water. He would die of both thirst and hunger, unable to decide which to get first. Now inject some randomness by randomly nudging the donkey closer to one source, no matter which. The impasse is broken, and our happy donkey will be both fed and hydrated. ""Flipping a coin"" breaks some of the minor stalemates in life where one lets randomness help with the decision process. A slightly random schedule prevents us from optimizing and being exceedingly efficient in the wrong things. A little bit of uncertainty (taking the subway home after dinner) can make you relax at dinner instead of hurrying to catch a scheduled train. Helps you be a satisficer instead of maximizer. RANDOMNESS AND OUR MIND: Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky : behavioral finance and economics. Heuristics. Example : the inability to accept anything abstract as risk. Normative science = how things should be. Positive science = how people are actually observed to behave. (Normative economics is like religion without the aesthetics.) Biases do not disappear when there are incentives. Russian legal system has conflicting and contradictory laws : sometimes you have to violate a law to comply with another. This legal system came from the piecewise development of the rules. You add a law here and there and there is no central system consulted every time to ensure compatibility. Napoleon had a similar situation in France, so he remedied it by setting up a top-down code of law for a full legal consistency. Our brains are like the Russian system. Your brain reacts differently to the same situation depending on which chapter you open to. ""I'm as good as my last trade"" = Prospect Theory = Looking at differences, not absolutes, and resetting to a specific reference point. ""Sound-bite effect"" or ""Fade the fears"" = Affect heuristic, Risk-as-Feeling Theory = People react to concrete and visible risks, not abstract ones. ""It was so obvious"" = Hindsight Bias = Things appear to be more predictable after the fact. ""You were wrong"" = Belief in the law of small numbers = Inductive fallacies; jumping to general conclusions too quickly. ""Brooklyn smarts / MIT intelligence"" = Two systems of reasoning = The working brain is not quite the reasoning one. ""It will never go there"" = Overconfidence = Risk-taking out of an underestimation of the odds. You do not have everything you know in your mind at all times, so you retrieve the knowledge in a piecemeal fashion, which puts these retrieved knowledge chunks in their local context. You have an arbitrary reference point and react to differences from that point, forgetting that you are only looking at the differences from that particular perspective of the local context, not the absolutes. When you take a gamble, do you say ""My net worth will end up at $99k or $101.5k after the gamble"" or do you say, ""I lose $1000 or make $1500?"" Your attitude toward the risks and rewards of the gamble will vary according to whether you look at your net worth or changes in it. Because of this resetting, wealth itself does not really make one happy, but positive changes in wealth may, especially if they come as ""steady"" increases. This anchoring to a number is the reason people do not react to their total accumulated wealth, but to differences of wealth from whatever number they are currently anchored to. We do not *think* when making choices, but use heuristics. We make serious probabilistic mistakes in today's world. QUIZ: A test of a disease presents a rate of 5% false positives. The disease strikes 1/1000 of the population. People are tested at random, regardless of whether they are suspected of having the disease. A patient's test is positive. What is the probability of the patient having the disease? Most doctors say 95%! True answer is 1/50. (2%). The positive reading just made it 20 times more likely the patient has it. Now 1/1000 chance is increased to 1/50 chance. Very few option traders can maintain a ""long volatility"" position : a position that will most likely lose a small quantity of money, but is expected to make money in the long run because of occasional spurts. Very few people can lose $1 for most expirations and make $10 once in a while, even if the game were fair. We think with our emotions, and there is no way around it. JOURNALISTS: People get mixed up between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. When news says ""Dow up 1.3 on lower interest rates"", it's less than a 0.01% move, which requires no explanation, nothing to explain, no reasons to adduce. But journalists being paid to provide explanations will gladly provide them. Unless something moves by more than its usual daily percentage, it's noise. A 2% move is 4-10 times more significant than a 1% move. A 7% move can be several billion times more relevant than a 1% move. Too many people read explanations. We cannot instinctively understand the nonlinear aspect of probability. Unless the source of a statement has extremely high qualifications, the statement will be more revealing of the author than the information judged. Unless you have confidence in the ruler's reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table, you may also be using the table to measure the ruler. Put wax in your ears and ignore the news. EMOTIONS: I cannot help it, but I am emotional and derive most of my energy from emotions. So the solution is not to tame my heart. Since my heart does not agree with my brain, I need to take serious action to avoid making irrational trading decisions. Most of us know how we should behave. It's the execution that's the problem, not the absence of knowledge. Ignore the noise component in market performance. We need tricks to get us there, but we need to accept the fact that we are mere animals in need of lower forms of tricks, not lectures. STOICS / SKEPTICS / CHANGING YOUR MIND: The skeptics' main teaching was that nothing could be accepted with certainty, conclusions of various degrees of probability could be formed, and these supplied a guide to conduct. We learned from Popper how to remain self-critical, to respect him more, as he did not hew stubbornly to an opinion for the mere fact that he had voiced it in the past. Your average literature professor would fault him for his contradictions and his change of mind. Proust did not consider that the diplomat might have changed his mind. We are supposed to be faithful to our opinions. One becomes a traitor otherwise. What characterizes real speculators like Soros from the rest is that their activities are devoid of path dependence. They are totally free from their past actions. Every day is a clean slate. Say you own a painting you bought for $20k, and is now worth $40k. If you owned no painting, would you buy it at the current price? If not, then you are said to be married to your position. There is no rational reason to keep a painting you would not buy at its current market rate - only emotional investment. Many people get married to their ideas all the way to the grave. Beliefs are said to be path-dependent if the sequence of ideas is such that the first one dominates. Researchers found that purely rational behavior can come from a defect in the amygdala that blocks the emotions of attachment, meaning that the subject is literally a psychopath. You attribute your successes to skills, but your failures to randomness. Scientists attributed their failures to an ""extremely rare"" event : they thought they were right but luck played against them. Why? It is a human heuristic that makes us actually believe so in order to not kill our self-esteem and keep us going against adversity. Science is great, but scientists are dangerous. They are human, and often forced to act like a cheap defense lawyer rather than a pure seeker of the truth. PERSONAL ELEGANCE: No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word. We are left only with dignity as a solution : dignity defined as the execution of a protocol of behavior that does not depend on the immediate circumstance. It may not be the optimal one, but it is certainly the one that makes us feel best. Start stressing personal elegance at your next misfortune. Try not to blame others for your fate, even if they deserve blame. Never exhibit self-pity. Do not complain. The only article Lady Fortuna has no control over is your behavior.",Mr Black Swan sure does love the sound of his own voice. Interesting thoughts on investing and misjudging randomness inside lots of blather.
The Obsolete Employee,Michael Russer,0966248465,3,"Business owners will always have issues with their support staff as long as they don't feel truly fulfilled by their work, no matter what perks the employer gives them. You (the business owner) are working for the person (employee) who asks, ""What can you do for me today?"" A team full of people resenting the team leader is no team at all. Have formal written business processes for every signifiant job function. Outsource it to a consultant who specializes in creating and maintaining written business processes. Talent on demand rather than having to pay for employees all the time, whether you need them or not. You are hiring an independent contractor who is an expert at what they do (rather than a jack of all trades).

Important to have a written business process for each support function a VA does for you. This discipline will quickly disappear into a mist of good intentions as soon as you try to broaden the scope of your VAs. COO : Must have extensive experience assisting businesses from the strategic, operational, and HR perspectives. Start with the small steps of hiring VAs for specific, measurable tasks. After you have two or more working with you and everything is going smoothly, consider hiring an executive level VA to grow your virtual team beyond that point. If your VA team interacts with your prospects, customers, or suppliers, have them use your email signature (with their name not yours).","How to run a company without employees, but with a loose network of work-from-home freelance agents.

Secrets of the Millionaire Mind,T. Harv Ecker,0060763280,3,"WEALTH PRINCIPLEs: Your income can only grow to the extent you do. If you want to change the fruits, you first have to change the roots. To change the visible, first you have to change the invisible. Money is a result, wealth is a result, health is a result, illness is a result, your weight is a result. We live in a world of cause and effect. Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life. Thoughts lead to feelings. Feelings lead to actions. Actions lead to results. When the subconscious mind must choose between deeply rooted emotions and logic, emotions will always win. If your motivation for acquiring money or success comes from a nonsupportive root such as fear, anger, or the need to prove yourself, your money will never bring you happiness. The only way to permanently change the temperature in the room is to reset the thermostat. The only way to change your level of financial success ""permanently"" is to reset your financial thermostat. Consciousness is observing your thoughts and actions so that you can live from true choice in the present moment, rather than being run by programming from the past. You can choose to think in ways that will support you in your happiness and success instead of ways that don't. Money is extremely important in the areas in which it works, and extremely unimportant in the areas in which it doesn't. When you are complaining, you become a living breathing ""crap magnet"". There is no such thing as a really rich victim. If your goal is to be comfortable, chances are you'll never get rich. If your goal is to be rich, chances are you'll end up comfortable. The number one reason most people don't get what they want is that they don't know what they want. If you are not fully totally and truly committed to creating wealth, chances are you won't. The law of income : you will be paid in direct proportion to the value you deliver according to the marketplace. Leaders earn a heck of a lot more money than followers. The secret to success is not to try to avoid or get rid of or shrink from your problems; the secret is to grow yourself so that you are bigger than any problem. If you have a big problem in your life, you are being a small person. If you say you're worthy, you are. If you say you're not worthy, you're not. Either way you will live into your story. If a hundred-root oak tree had the mind of a human, it would only grow to be ten feet tall. For every giver there must be a receiver, and for every receiver there must be a giver. Money will only make you more of what you already are. How you do anything is how you do everything. There's nothing wrong with getting a steady paycheck, unless it interferes with your ability to earn what you're worth. There's the rub. It usually does. Never have a ceiling on your income. Rich people believe you can have your cake and eat it too. Middle-class people believe cake is too rich, so they only have a little. Poor people don't believe they deserve cake, so they order a donut, focus on the hole, and wonder why they have nothing. The true measure of wealth is net worth, not working income. Where attention goes, energy flows, and results show. Until you show you can handle what you've got, you won't get any more. The habit of managing your money is more important than the amount. Rich people see every dollar as a ""seed"" that can be planted to earn a hundred more dollars, which can then be replanted to earn a thousand more. Action is the bridge between the inner world and outer world. A true warrior can tame the cobra of fear. It is not necesssary to try to get rid of fear in order to succeed. If you are only willing to do what's easy, life will be hard. If you are willing to do what's hard, life will be easy. The only time you are actually growing is when you're uncomfortable. Training and managing your own mind is the most important skill you could ever own, in terms of both happiness and success. You can be right, or you can be rich, but you can't be both. Every master was once a disaster. To get paid the best, you must be the best. *** WEALTH FILES: Rich people believe ""I create my life"". Poor people believe ""life happens to me"". Rich people play the money game to win. Poor people play the money game to not lose. Rich people are committed to being rich. Poor people want to be rich. Rich people think big. Poor people think small. Rich people focus on opportunities. Poor people focus on obstacles. Rich people admire other rich and successful people. Poor people resent rich and successful people.

Rich people have their money work hard for them. Poor people work hard for their money. Rich people act in spite of fear. Poor people let fear stop them. Rich people constantly learn and grow. Poor people think they already know. ========= SOMEONE ELSE'S NOTES ON THIS BOOK: p 10 WEALTH PRINCIPLE: Your income can grow only to the extent that you do! ...The vast majority of people simply do not have the internal capacity to create and hold on to large amounts of money and the increased challenges that go with more money and success. that, my friends, is the primary reason they don't have much money. p 13 What you cannot see in this world is far more powerful than anything you can see. You may or may not agree with this statement, but to the extent that you do not apply this principle in your life, you must be suffering. Why? because you are going against the laws of nature, whereby what is under the ground creates what is above the ground, where what is invisible creates what is visible. p 15 Now hear this: A lack of moeny is never, ever a problem. A lack of money is merely a symptom of what is going on underneath. ...All energy travels in frequencies and vibrations. therefore, each declaration you make carries its own vibrational frequency. p 32 Money is not the root of the problem; fear is. What's even worse is that fear is not just a problem; it's a habit. p 56 If victims aren't blaming, you'll often find them justifying or rationalizing their situation by saying something like ""Money's not really important."" Let me ask you this question: If you said that your husband or your wife, or your boyfriend or your girlfriend, or your partner or your friend, weren't all that important, would any of them be around for long? I don't think so, and neither would money!...No rich people believe that money is not important. p 57 Try paying your bills with love. Still not sure? then pop on over to the bank and try depositing some love and see what happens. p 58 ..Law of Attraction (says) ""like attracts like"", meaning that when you are complaining, you are actually attracting ""crap"" into your life. ...WEALTH principle: When you are complaining, you become a living, breathing ""crap magnet"". ..Have you ever noticed that complainers usually have a tough life? it seems that everything that could go wrong does go wrong for them. they say, ""Of course I complain -- look how crappy my life is."" And now that you know better, you can explain to them, ""No, it's BECAUSE you complain that your life is so crappy. Shut up...and don't stand near me!""...Which brings us to another point. you have to make darn sure not to put yourself in the proximity of complainers. if you absolutely have to be nearby, make sure you bring a steel umbrella or the crap meant for them will get you too! p 59 For the next seven days I challenge you to not complain at all. Not just out loud, but in your head as well. But you have to do it for the full seven days. Why? Because for the first few days, you may still have some ""residual crap"" coming to you from before. Unfortunately crap doesn't travel at the speed of light, you know, it travels at the speed of crap so it might take a while to clear out. p 60 Wealth Principle: There is no such thing as a really rich victim! p 61 It's time to decide. You can be a victim OR you can be rich, but you can't be both. Listen up! Every time, and I mean EVERY time you blame, justify or complain, you are SLITTING YOUR FINANCIAL THROAT... It's time to take back your power and acknowledge that you create everything that is in your life and everything that is not in it. p 63 When your intention is to have enough to pay the bills, that's exactly how much you'll get -- just enough to pay the bills and not a dime more....There's a big difference between being comfortable and being rich. p 67 The universe, which is another way of saying ""higher power,"" is akin to a big mail-order department. it is constantly delievering people, events and things to you. You ""order"" what you get by sending energetic messages out to the universe based on your predominant beliefs. Again, based on the law of Attraction, the universe will do its best to say yes and support you. But if you have mixed messages in your file, the universe can't understand what you want. One minute the universe hears that you want to be rich, so it begins sending you opportunities for wealth. But then it hears you say, ""Rich people are greedy,"" so the universe begins to suport you in not having much money. But then you think, ""Having a lot of money makes life so much more enjoyable,"" so the poor universe, dazed and confused, restarts sending you opportunities for more money. The next day you're in an uninspired mood so you think, ""Money's not that important."" The frustrated universe finally screams ""Make up your frickin' mind! I'll get you what you want, just tell me what it is!"" p 69 This is the warrior's way. No excuses, no ifs, no buts, no maybes--and failure is not an option. The warrior's way is simply: ""I will be rich or I will die trying."" p 73 Wealth File #4: Rich people think big. poor people think small. ""Everything changed the moment I began to think big."" I refer you to the law of Income, w hich states, ""You will be paid in direct proportion to the value you deliver according to the marketplace."" p 76 The world doesn't need more people playing small. it's time to stop hiding out and start stepping out. it's time to stop needing and start leading. it's time to start sharing your gifts instead of hoarding them or pretending they don't exist. It's time you started playing the game of life in a ""big"" way. p 80 Rich people focus on what they want, while poor people focus on what they don't want. Again, the universal law states, ""What you focus on expands."" Because rich people focus on the opportunities in everything, opportunities abound for them...because poor people focus on the obstacles in everything, obstacles abound for them and their biggest problem is handling all the incredible obstacles they see. p 92 Resenting the rich is one of the surest ways to stay broke. We are creatures of habit, and to overcome this or any other habit, we need to practice. Instead of resenting rich people, I want you to practice ADMIRING rich people, I want you to practice BLESSING rich people, and I want you to practice LOVING rich people. That way, unconsciously you know that when you become rich, other people will admire you, bless you, and love you instead of resent the heck out of you the way you might do them now. Bless that which you want. if you see a person with a beautiful home, bless that person and bless that home... The point is, if you resent what people have, in any way, shape or form, you can never have it! p 97 (people in your life with nonsupportive energy)...I respect myself and my life and i deserve to be as happy and successful as possible. they way I figure it, there are over 6.3 billion people in the world and there's no way I'm going to saddle myself with a downer. Either they move up or I move on! Again, energy is contagious: either you AFFECT people or you INFECT people. The same holds true the opposite way around; either people affect you or infect you.... ""Birds of a feather flock together."" Did you know that most people earn within 20 percent of the average income of their closest friends? That's why you'd better watch whom you associate with and choose whom you spend your time with carefully. p 100 My friends, it's not about ""touching"" millionairs, it's about deciding that you are just as good and worthy as they are, and then acting like it. p 107 Wealth Principle: The secret to success is not to try to avoid or get rid of or shrink from your problems; the secret is to grow yourself so that you are bigger than any problem. p 113 Wealth Principle: If you say you're worthy, you are. If you say you're not worth, you're not. Either way you will live into your story. p 121 Say to yourself, hand on your heart: I AM AN EXCELLENT RECEIVER. I AM OPEN AND WILLING TO RECEIVE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO MY LIFE: Touch your head and say..""I have a millionaire mind!"" p 137 Wealth File #13 Rich people focus on their net worth. Poor people focus on their working income. p 143 Wealth Principle: Where attention goes, energy flows and results show. p 147 Wealth Principle: Until you show you can handle what you've got, you won't get any more! p 153 Wealth Principle: Either you control money, or it will control you. p 167 Wealth Principle: Action is the ""bridge"" between the inner world and the outer world. p 169 Wealth Principle: If you are willing to do only what's easy, life will be hard. but if you are willing to do what's hard, life will be easy. p 171 Wealth Principle: The only time you are actually growing is when you are uncomfortable.","If you suspect that your mindset is holding you back from making more money, read this. Identifies and dissolves the mental baggage we've built up that believes money is evil and those who have it are greedy."
Execution,Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan,0609610570,3,"Execution: - the missing link - the main reason companies fall short of their promises - the gap between what a company's leaders want to achieve and the ability of their organizations to deliver it - a system of getting things done through questioning, analysis, follow-through. meshing strategy with reality, aligning people with goals, achieving results promised - a central part of a company's strategy and the major job of any leader in business The cause : strategies most often fail because they aren't executed well. Things that are supposed to happen don't happen. Unless you translate big thoughts into concrete steps for action, they're pointless. Without execution, the breakthrough thinking breaks down, learning adds no value, people don't meet their stretch goals, and the revolution stops dead in its tracks. What you get is change for the worse because failure drains the energy from your organization. Repeated failure destroys it. Execution must be a core element of an organization's culture. Execution is a systematic process of rigorously discussing hows and whats, questioning, tenaciously following-through, and ensuring accountability. Linking rewards to outcomes. Includes mechanisms for changing assumptions as the environment changes and upgrading the company's capabilities to meet the challenges of an ambitious strategy. Execution is a systematic way of exposing reality and acting on it. Most companies don't face reality very well. You need robust dialogue to surface the realities of the business. You need accountability for results - discussed openly and agreed to by those responsible - to get things done and reward the best performers. You need follow-through to ensure plans are on track. Which people will do the job, and how will they be judged and held accountable? What human, technical, production, and financial resources are needed to execute the strategy? Will the organization have the ones it needs two years out, when the strategy goes to the next level? Does the strategy deliver the earnings required for success? Can it be broken down into doable initiatives? Strategy takes account of people and operational realities. People are chosen and promoted in light of strategic and operational plans. Operations are linked to strategic goals and human capacities. The leader of the business and his leadership team are deeply engaged in all three. THEY are the owners of the processes - not the strategic planners or HR or finance staffs. The leader has to be engaged personally and deeply in the business. Execution requires a comprehensive understanding of a business, its people, and its environment. Only the leader can make execution happen, through deep personal involvement in the substance and details of execution. The leader must be in charge of getting things done by running the three core processes: picking other leaders, setting the strategic direction, and conducting operations. How could would a sports team be if the coach spent all his time in his office making deals for new players, while delegating actual coaching to an assistant? Only a leader can ask the tough questions that everyone needs to answer, then manage the process of debating the information and making the right trade-offs. Dialogue is the core of culture and the basic unit of work. How people talk to each other absolutely determines how well the organization will function. Far too many leaders avoid debating about people openly in group settings. Micromanagers rarely know as much about what needs to be done as the people they're harassing. The leader who boasts of his hands-off style or puts faith in empowerment is not dealing with the issues of the day, not confronting the people responsible for poor performance, or searching for problems to solve, then making sure they get solved. The leader who executes assembles an architecture of execution puts into place a culture and processes for executing, promoting people who get things done more quickly and giving them greater rewards. His personal involvement in that architecture is to assign the tasks and then follow-up. This means making sure that people understand the priorities, which are based on comprehensively understanding the business, and asking incisive questions. The leader who executes often doesn't even have to tell people what to do - he asks questions so they can figure out what they need to do. Coaching them, passing on experience as a leader, educating them to think in ways they never thought before. This helps them expand their own capabilities for leading. Passionate about getting results. Execution has to be embedded in the reward systems and in the norms of behavior that everyone practices. The gap between the desired and actual outcome in everything from profit margins to the selection of people for promotion. Close the gap and move the bar still higher. The leader doesn't just sign off on a plan. He wants an explanation, and will drill down until the answers are clear. (story about leader who messed up) : Joe did all the right things. By the standards of execution, he did almost nothing right. The gap between goals and outcome reflected a chasm between Joe's ambitions and the realities of the organization. Though he chewed out his execs when they didn't make numbers, he never asked WHY they didn't make them. An execution-savvy leader would have asked that right away. Then focused on the cause. Stretch goals can be useful in forcing people to break old rules and do things better. They're worse if unrealistic or if the people who have to meet them aren't given the chance to debate them beforehand and take ownership of them. Involve all the people responsible for the strategic plan's outcome - including the key production people - in shaping the plan. Ask people about the hows of execution : how, specifically, they are going to achieve their projected demand on a timely basis. Set milestones for the progress of the plan, with strict accountability for the people in charge. Make an agreement it will be X% complete by Y date, and Z% of the people would be trained in the process. Set plans to deal with the unexpected. Especially when a business is making major changes, the right people have to be in the critical jobs, and the core processes must be strong enough to ensure that resistance is dissolved and plans get executed. Executives couldn't get info about profit by customer, product line, or channel, so they had no way of making good decisions about where to allocate resources. Innovator's Dilemma : companies with the greatest strength in a mature technology tend to be the least successful in mastering new ones. Listening to tomorrow's customers as well as today's and planning for their needs. Monday-morning conference calls : an ongoing operating review : performance for the previous month compared with the commitments people have made. Early warnings of problems instill a sense of urgency. People who fall short have to explain why, and what they are going to do about it. Show me an organization that's wringing its hands, listening to rumors, anxious about the future, and I will show you leadership that behaves the same way. People imitate their leaders. Develop a compensation system that links rewards to performance, along with a web-based set of evaluation tools to help managers sharpen their assessments of their people. 7 essential behaviours that form the first building block of execution: * - know your people and your business * - insist on realism * - set clear goals and priorities * - follow through * - reward the doers * - expand people's capabilities * - know yourself Tough questions : good people like to be quizzed, because they know more about the business than the leader. When you probe, you learn things and your people learn things. Everybody gains from the dialogue. You dignify the leadership at the management level by allowing them to expound on the business. Both parties came away with a clear agreement about what the manager needed to do to make the business better. Tough questions got the manager to see the realities of his business more clearly and connected them with the external environment. The dialogue schooled them in how to think about the business in a more rigorous and analytical way. Encouraging and motivating the plant team, creating energy. As a leader, you have to show up. You've got to conduct business reviews. You can't be detached and removed and absent. After a business review, write the manager a formal letter summarizing the things he agreed to do, but also write a personal note to say, ""Great job. Things could be better and you need to work on it, but otherwise things are going great."" The personal connection is especially critical when a leader starts something new. The leader's personal involvement, understanding, and commitment are necessary to overcome this passive resistance. Announce the initiative. Define it clearly. Define its importance in the organization. You can't do that unless you understand how it will work and what it really means in terms of benefit. Then follow-through to make sure everyone takes it seriously. You can't do this if you don't understand the problems that come with implementation: talk about them with the people doing the implementing, and make it clear - again and again - that you expect them to execute it. Realism is the heart of execution, but many organizations are filled with people who are trying to avoid or shade reality. Why? Because it makes life uncomfortable. People want to hide mistakes, or buy time to figure out a solution rather than admit they don't have an answer at the moment. They want to avoid confrontations. Nobody wants to be the messenger that gets shot, or the troublemaker that challenges the authority of her superiors. Embracing realism means always taking a realistic view of your company and comparing it with other companies. Focus on 3 or 4 priorities. Simplify things so that others can understand them, evaluate them, act on them, so what they say becomes common sense. Many corporations do such a poor job of linking rewards to performance that there's little correlation at all. They don't distinguish between those who achieve results and those who don't, either in base pay or bonuses. ""When I see companies that don't execute, the chances are they don't measure, don't reward, and don't promote people who know how to get things done. Salary increases in terms of percentage are too close between the top performers and those who are not. There's not enough differentiation in bonus. Leaders need the confidence to explain to an employee why he got a lower-than-expected reward."" Otherwise, people think they're involved in Socialism. That isn't what you want when you strive for a culture of execution. Make it clear to everybody that rewards and respect are based on performance. COACHING Coaching is the single most important part of expanding others' capabilities. The difference between giving orders and teaching people how to get things done. Good leaders regard every encounter as an opportunity to coach. Observe a person in action then provide specific useful feedback. Point out examples of behavior and performance that are good or need to be changed. When the leader discusses business and organizational issues in a group setting, everybody learns. Wrestling with challenging issues collectively, exploring pros and cons and alternatives, deciding which ones make sense increases people's capabilities both individually and collectively - if it's done with honesty and trust. Ask the questions that bring out the realities and give people the help they need to correct problems. 4 core qualities that make up emotional fortitude: * - authenticity * - self-awareness * - self-mastery * - humility Most efforts at cultural change fail because they are not linked to improving the business' outcomes. CREATE A CULTURE OF GETTING THINGS DONE: * - Tell people clearly what results you're looking for. * - Discuss how to get those results. * - Reward people for producing the results. * - If they come up short, provide additional coaching, withdraw rewards, give them other jobs, or let them go. We don't think ourselves into a new way of acting, we act ourselves into a new way of thinking. When people violate one of the company's basic values, the leader must step forth to publicly condemn those violations. Anything less is interpreted as a lack of emotional fortutide. The beliefs that influence specific behaviors are more likely to need changing. If they believe others who do less than they do will get the same rewards, that belief will drain their energy. EXAMPLE OLD BELIEFS: We are in a commodity business. We can't grow at market rates. Profits follow revenues. Each leader owns all resources - control is key. My peer is my competitor. People aren't accountable. EXAMPLE NEW BELIEFS: We can grow faster than the market - profitably and using capital efficiently. We can increase productivity every year. We are committed to our clients' success. Collaboration is key. An agenda for attitude change. Behaviors are beliefs turned into action. This is less about individual behavior than about norms of behavior: the accepted, expected ways groups of people behave. The foundation of changing behavior is linking rewards to performance and making the linkages transparent. A business's culture defines what gets appreciated and respected and rewarded. It tells the people in the organization what's valued and recognized, and in the interest of trying to make their own careers more successful, that's where they will concentrate. If a company rewards and promotes people for execution, its culture will change. People love to give rewards. They love to be loved. But they don't have the emotional fortitude to give honest feedback and either withhold a reward or penalize people. The process has to have integrity: the right information must be collected and used, based on behavior and performance criteria. If you did the same job this year, you're rated lower because you didn't get any better and everyone else did. You've got to realize, the company is improving, everyone's got to improve the job they do, and if you're staying the same, you're falling behind. Other leaders design rewards for new behaviors of execuation but implement them brutally. They don't take the important steps of helping people to master the new required behaviors. They don't coach. They don't teach people to break a major concept down into smaller critical tasks that can be executed in the short term, which is difficult for some people. They don't conduct the dialogues that surface realities, teach people how to think, or bring issues to closure. These are the meetings where there's no robust debate and therefore nobody states their misgivings. Instead they simply let the project they didn't like die a quiet death over time. Leaders who create disproportionate awards for high performers and high-potential people are creating social software that drives behaviors : people work harder and differentiating themselves. They let people who normally don't have much contact with one other exchange views, share info and ideas, and learn to understand the company as a whole. Spread the leader's beliefs, behaviors, and mode of dialogue throughout the organization. Other leaders learn to bring these beliefs and behaviors to the lowest-level meetings and interactions, including coaching and feedback. It becomes their beliefs, behaviors and dialogue as well. How to work together in constructive debate. No one person has all the ideas or all the answers. If we have a problem in one place, people will respond by getting together and finding a solution, not by sitting around and moaning that they don't have a solution or deciding to engage a consultant. Practicing such constructive debates over time builds confidence in people to tackle unfamiliar issues as they arise. Robust dialogue ends with closure. At the end of the meeting, people agree about what each person has to do and when. They've committed to it in an open forum. They are accountable for the outcomes. Robust dialogue brings out reality, even with that reality makes people uncomfortable, because it has purpose and meaning. It's open, tough, focused, and informal. The aim is to invite multiple viewpoints, see the pros and cons of each one, and try honestly and candidly to construct new viewpoints. This is the dynamic that stimulates new questions, new ideas, and new insights, rather than wasting energy on defending the old order. To build an execution organization, the leader has to be present to create and reinforce the social software with the desired behaviors and the robust dialogue. You hire a talented person, and they will hire a talented person. What are the three non-negotiable criteria for the job? Every business needs a discipline that is embedded in the people process, with candid dialogues about the matches between people and jobs, and follow-through that ensures people take the appropriate actions. Most people know someone in their organization who doesn't perform well, yet manages to keep his job. The usual reason is the person's leader doesn't have the emotional fortitude to confront him and take decisive action. Such failures can do considerable damage to a business. If the nonperformer is high enough in the organization, he can destroy it. Many jobs are filled with the wrong people because the leaders who promote them are comfortable with them. It's natural for leaders to develop a sense of loyalty to those they've worked with over time, particularly if they've come to trust their judgements, but it's a serious problem with the loyalty is based on the wrong factors. For example, the leader may be comfortable with a person because that person thinks like him and doesn't challenge him, or has developed the skill of hiding the boss from conflict. The most important question : how good is this person at getting things done? There's very little correlation between those who talk a good game, and those who get things done. You're searching for people with an enormous drive for winning. People who get their satisfaction from getting things done. You can easily spot the doers by observing their working habits. They're the ones who energize people, are decisive on tough issues, get things done through others, and follow-through as 2nd nature. Never finish a conversation without summarizing the actions to be taken. GETTING THINGS DONE THROUGH OTHERS Getting things done through others is a fundamental leadership skill. Indeed if you can't do it, you're not leading. Some smother their people, blocking their initiative and creativity. They're the micromanagers, insecure leaders who can't trust others to get it right because they don't know how to calibrate them and monitor their performance. They wind up making all of the key decisions about details themselves, so they don't have time to deal with the larger issues they should be focusing on, or respond to the surprises that inevitably come along. Others abandon their people. They believe wholeheartedly in delegating: let people grow on their own, sink or swim, empower themselves. They explain the challenge (sometimes at such a high level of abstraction that it amounts to superficiality) and toss the ball entirely into their people's court. They don't set milestones, and they don't follow through. Then, when things don't get done as expected, they're frustrated. Both types reduce the capabilities of their organizations. The 80-hour-week is actually a major weakness. ""You have to come in here less, but your performance can't change. It must be as good as it is now. Learn how to get things done through others."" Follow-through is the cornerstone of execution. It ensures that people are doing the things they committed to do, according to the agreed timetable. It exposes any lack of discipline and connection between ideas and actions, and forces specificity. Never finish a meeting without clarifying what the follow-through will be, who will do it, when and how they will do it, what resources they will use, and how and when the next review will take place and with whom. Never launch an initiative unless you're personally committed to it, and prepared to see it through until it's embedded in the DNA of an organization. Look for energy and enthusiasm for execution. Does the candidate get excited by doing things, or just talking about them? Is her life full of achievement and accomplishment? What does this person want to talk about? The thrill of getting things done, or keeps wandering back to strategy or philosophy? Does she detail the obstacles she had to overcome? Does she explain the roles played by the people assigned to her? Does she seem to have the ability to persuade and enlist others in a mission? If you sit down with your boss, and your boss hasn't said something about your weaknesses, go back! Otherwise you're not going to learn anything. The leader sits down with the person and discusses the appraisal. At the end I'll say, ""Now I'm going to give you the last line. You've heard what I think. What would you like to add to this?"" Instead of debating the quality and performance of individuals, they became more focused on how we can help so-and-so overcome this gap in knowledge or experience or capability, or where we should move him. If you have leaders with the right behavior, a culture that rewards execution, and a consistent system for getting the right people in the right jobs, the foundation is in place for operating and managing each of the core processes effectively. PEOPLE PROCESS A robust people process does 3 things: Evaluates individuals accurately and in depth. Provides a framework for identifying and developing the leadership talent - at all levels and all kinds - the organization will need to execute its strategies down the road. Fills the leadership pipeline that's the basis of a strong succession plan. One of the biggest shortcomings of the traditional people process is that it's backward-looking, focused on evaluating the jobs people are doing today. Far more important is whether the individuals can handle the jobs of tomorrow. The shift in skill mix that will be required for the new environment. Make Strategy Milestones: (EXAMPLES:) Near-Term (0-2 years): * expand product selection, *launch new initiative to expand services to installed base, *secure new expertise in technology Medium Term (2-5 years): *engage and evaluage alliance partners, etc. Long Term (5+ years): *become pioneers of leapfrog technology, *build more useful alliances, *develop low-cost sourcing ideas Leadership Assessment Summary: Y-axis is ""PERFORMANCE"" : top = ""exceeds standard"", bottom = ""below standard"" X-axis is ""BEHAVIOR"" : top = ""exceeds standard"", bottom = ""below standard"" Make a square & put people in these. Continuous Improvement Summary: Like a traditional performance appraisal, but not only captures key performance highlights (good & bad) but includes clear specific useful information on development needs. Helps the individual become a better performer. List of skills on left. 1-5 score on right to match up to each. Below, summary of ""performance highlights"", ""targets missed"", ""challenges"", ""summary strengths"", ""development needs"", ""development plan"", ""potential next moves (long term) & also (short-term)"" Focus on what needs to be done to retain critical people and replace those who leave unexpectedly, are promoted, or fail. Retention Risk Analysis looks at a person's marketability, potential for mobility, risk a business faces if s/he leaves. If she's been in her existing job too long, she's likely to feel blocked from moving upward, and susceptible to headhunter calls. Succession depth analysis determines whether the company has enough high-potential people to fill key positions. Looks at whether there are high-potential people in the wrong jobs and whether key people will be lost if a job is not unblocked for them. When a key person does leave, the process provides a needed replacement within 24 hours. Identifying high-potential and promotable people avoids two dangers. One is organizational inertia - keeping people in the same jobs for too long. The other is moving people up too quickly. Why would an assessment be sent back? Maybe the words are lukewarm. The assessor says a person is doing ""wonderfully"", and under development needs puts ""none"". Who is this manager kidding? How can a leader help a person when he tells her she's got no development needs? I tell these people, ""Go back and do the assesment you've been asked to do."" Sometimes important issues are omitted in the assessments and then brought up in the meeting. Why weren't they on the sheet? How does the manager know about them? Don't talk to me about things you haven't talked to her about. If she's got a problem, put it on the sheet and have her acknowledge it. When several people who've watched the same person over time pool their observations in robust dialogue, subjective views become objective. Even the best people process doesn't always get the right people in the right jobs. It can't make everybody a great peformer. Some managers have been promoted beyond their capabilities and need to be put into lesser jobs. Others just need to be moved out. HR has to be linked to stragegy and operations, and to the assessments that the managers ultimately make about people. Demand that the company use ALL of its capabilities to make money. ""I want bigger margins than anybody else, and to accomplish this, we have to have great people and train them better and faster than everybody else. We need to have educational programs that are focused on key business issues and problems, the things that matter. HR's role is to help me solve those problems."" The HR person not only has to be well trained in the craft : how to teach people, develop them, make them interested in staying with us, and know what's important for building momentum and morale in an organization - but also must have the same characteristics as any business leader has. Business acumen, understanding how a company makes money, thinking critically, a passion for results, linking strategy and execution. Forces executives to really drill down and identify what the critical jobs are. The right people are in the right jobs when information about individuals is collected constantly and leaders know the people, how they work together, and whether they deliver results - or fail to. It's the consistency of practice that develops expertise in appraising and choosing the right people. The people process begins with one-on-one assessments, but when developed and practiced as a total process, it becomes incredibly effective as an execution tool. Strategic plan must be an action plan that leaders can rely on to reach objectives. In creating it, ask whether and how your organization can do the things needed to achieve its goals. Start with identifying and defining the critical issues behind the strategy. Bad stratgegy is disconnected from both external and internal realities. Didn't test its critical assumptions to see if they were robust, and had no alternative plan for what to do if one or more of them proved wrong. Substance of any strategy is summed up by its building blocks : 1-6 key concepts and actions that define it. Pinpointing the building blocks forces leaders to be clear as they debate and discuss the strategy. Helps judge whether it's worth doing and exploring alternatives. If building blocks are clearly defined, the essence of even the most complex strategy can be expressed on one page. Keep strategy up-to-date, reviewing the plan 3 times a year, and refining it as conditions change. To be effective, a strategy has to be constructed and owned by those who will execute it, namely the managers. They know the biz environment and capabilites because they live with them. They're in the best position to introduce ideas, to know which ideas will work in their marketplace and which ones won't. Stragegic plan must answer these questions: * - What is the assessment of the external environment? * - How well do you understand the existing customers and markets? * - What is the best way to grow the business profitably, and what are the obstacles to growth? * - Who is the competition? * - Can the business execute the strategy? * - Are the short term and long term balanced? * - What are the important milestones for executing the plan? * - What are the critical issues facing the business? * - How will the business make money on a sustainable basis? The strategic plan must explicitly state the external assumptions that management is making. Milestones bring reality to a strategic plan. If the business doesn't meet milestones as it executes plan, leaders have to reconsider whether they've got the right strategy after all. The reason your managers have been in on the plan from the beginning : because they helped build it and they own it, they carry it around in their heads all the time. Strategy Review: * - How well versed is each business unit team about the competition? * - How strong is the organizational capability to execute the strategy? * - Is the plan scattered or sharply focused? * - Are we choosing the right ideas? * - Are the linkages with people and operations clear? Focus not on what the competition has done in the past, but what they're up to and likely to do next. * - What are our competitors planning to do to serve their customer segments and prevent us from serving them? * - How good are their sales forces? * - What are our competitors doing to increase market share? * - How will they respond to our product offerings? * - What do we know about the background of our competition's leadership? * - What do we know abou their leader and his motivations, and what does that mean for us? * - What acquisitions will our key competitors make that will affect us? * - Could a competitor form an alliance and attack our segment? * - What new people have competitors added that alter the competitive landscape?",In-depth look at the dirty discipline of getting things done in a large organization.
The Good Ancestor,Roman Krznaric,1615197303,2,"We have colonized the future. We treat the future like a distant colonial outpost devoid of people, where we can freely dump ecological degradation, technological risk, and nuclear waste, and which we can plunder as we please. In your left hand you’ll find a squishy pink marshmallow. And in your right hand there is a shiny green acorn. Are you more likely to post a selfie on Instagram for popularity, or plant a seed in the ground for posterity? The pleasure system goes awry and becomes dominated by short-term desires and impulses that can easily transform into addictions. The acorn brain is the subject of a new field of research known as prospective psychology. If alien scientists wanted to destroy our species, they would invent something like global warming, which would slip under the radar of the human brain because we simply aren’t very good at acting on long-term threats. Although we will swiftly get out of the way of a baseball speeding towards our head, we are far less adept at dealing with a danger coming several years or decades down the line. The fact that we have grandmothers who live long past their reproductive age is likely a result of Darwinian selection; their presence enabled everyone to survive. It was through the grandmother effect that our ancestors became embedded in multigenerational kinship groups that helped them develop time horizons. For most people, the future goes dark after 15 to 20 years. Instead of the Buy Now button, imagine “Buy in a Week,” “Buy in a Month,” “Buy in a Year” buttons. Sends a reminder after the selected time had elapsed to see if you still really wanted the item. The sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle. The moon does the same and both are round. Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. The clock, not the steam engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. It made the artificial construct of minutes and seconds that mattered rather than the natural cycles of the moon or seasons. Oldest living things in world: lichens in Greenland that are over 2,000 years old and grow only one centimeter every hundred years. Our sun is less than halfway through its lifespan. It will not be humans who watch the sun’s demise, six billion years from now. Any creatures that then exist will be as different from us as we are from bacteria or amoebae. A telescope is a time machine enabling me to look deep into the past, since the light hitting my eye had been traveling for years or possibly centuries to reach the earth, and could even be coming from stars that no longer existed. What might our descendants wish we had done better for them? We are all recipients of gifts from previous generations: * the laborers of the past who built the roads and sewers we use every day * the medical researchers who found cures for smallpox and rabies * the campaigners who fought against slavery and for the voting rights we take for granted Legacy has its origins in medieval Europe. A legate - from the Latin legatus, meaning ambassador or envoy - was an emissary sent by the pope to faraway lands, bearing an important message. So someone leaving a legacy can be thought of as being an intertemporal ambassador of the present sending a gift into the distant future. We are all grandchildren and we are all ancestors. We do not inherit the land from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children. Futureholders: just as companies have shareholders, societies have futureholders: future citizens whose interests and welfare should be considered in the decisions that will affect their lives. Asked to allocate funds for the welfare of humankind, how would you distribute the funds through time? How much should be earmarked or invested for the benefit of future generations, and how many generations ahead? Imagine you stand behind a “veil of ignorance,” not knowing what position in society you will be born into - you have no idea what your wealth, sex, ethnic background, intelligence, or values will be. How would you distribute the resources of society? Do unto future generations as you would have past generations do unto you. Remember what we might wish they had never passed on to us: * the inheritance of colonial-era racism and patriarchal attitudes that still have a hold in so many countries * the environmental impacts of an industrial system based on fossil fuels. Jewish Talmud: a man is asked why he is planting a carob tree that will not produce fruit within his lifetime and replies, “Just as my ancestors planted for me, I too am planting for my descendants.” Professional forecasters performed worse on average than even the simplest rule of thumb, such as “always predict no change” or “assume the current rate of change continues uninterrupted.” “A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.” — Oscar Wilde. Utopias offer a vision of an ideal society to which we might aspire, with no illusion that it can be achieved overnight. If I proceed ten steps forward, it swiftly slips ten steps ahead. No matter how far I go, I can never reach it. What, then, is the purpose of utopia? It is to cause us to advance. Mars terraforming could take hundreds of years — the kind of long-term thinking we need. If we truly aspire to be good ancestors, we should embark as soon as possible on the cosmic task of settling Mars and other planets. No place in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. Tackling a problem like climate change might seem daunting, it is far easier than the task of colonizing Mars. Any mountaineer will tell you: make sure your base camp is in good condition with ample supplies before you attempt a risky summit. Survival mode replaces the denial of the climate crisis with another form of denial: the denial that change can happen. You’re not going to be there to take care of your offspring ten thousand generations from now. Take care of the place that’s going to take care of your offspring. Create conditions conducive to life. Future generations are disenfranchised in the same way that slaves and women were in the past. Embed the rights of future generations in the legal system. Nation states are a recent historical invention and have only been the dominant form of political organization for the past two centuries. Cities, in contrast, are the greatest and most enduring social technology ever invented by humankind. That is why cities such as Istanbul have lasted thousands of years, while empires and nations have risen and fallen around them. Don't use Earth’s resources faster than they can be naturally regenerated. Don't create waste faster than it can be naturally absorbed. Think “rewilding” rather than “conservation.” Not trying to restore nature to some remembered prior state but enabling ecological processes to resume by reintroducing plants and animals that can kickstart the recovery of wilderness and wildness. Yellowstone Park: the reintroduction of wolves in 1995 resulted in a “trophic cascade” of ecological regeneration: The wolves kept ravenous deer away from eating saplings, which allowed trees to grow back, which in turn brought back songbirds, beavers, and other creatures down the food chain. The impact of the French Revolution? It's “too soon to say.” Our “ethnosphere” provides the cultural air in which we breathe. It contains the swirl of ideas, beliefs, myths, and attitudes that are prevalent in society, and that constitute the worldviews shaping how we think and act. A genre now often known as “speculative fiction.” The purpose of his writing is to tell “the story of the next century.” John Cage’s intergenerational composition As Slow as Possible is currently being played on an organ in the German city of Halberstadt, over a period of 639 years. One chord began sounding in January 2006 and lasted two-and-a-half years before the next note was struck. The final note will be played in 2640. The ideal of a transcendent legacy: Future people we can never meet but whom we must endeavor to embrace as our kith and kin. Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. Milton Friedman recognized the transformative potential of ideas. After he and his like-minded colleagues worked for nearly half a century seeding free-market thinking in universities, think tanks, newspapers, and political parties, neoliberalism finally overcame its arch-rival, Keynesianism, in the 1980s, and still reigns supreme decades later as one of the most dominant worldviews of our times. A satisfying conversation is one which makes you say what you have never said before. The key question is not “how can I make a difference?” but “how can WE make the difference?” Individual lifestyle choices do not add up to much, unless they are scaled by politics. To fall in love with a place - a mountain, a woodland, a river - can transform us into guardians of the future, instilling a desire to preserve its life-giving wonders for generations to come.","I love the subject, and pre-ordered the book based on the title alone. But I found it hard to sift through the clutter of obvious and unnecessary sentences to find some interesting ideas."
The Elements of Style,William Strunk,9780205309023,2,"Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence. End it in conformity with the beginning. Enable the reader to discover the purpose of each paragraph. The topic sentence comes at or near the beginning. The succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in the topic sentence. The final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or states some important consequence. Avoid ending with a digression or with an unimportant detail. If the paragraph forms part of a larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word or phrase (again; therefore; for the same reason) in the topic sentence. Sometimes, however, it is expedient to precede the topic sentence by one or more sentences of introduction or transition. If more than one such sentence is required, it is generally better to set apart the transitional sentences as a separate paragraph. According to the writer’s purpose, he may, as indicated above, relate the body of the paragraph to the topic sentence in one or more of several different ways. He may make the meaning of the topic sentence clearer by restating it in other forms, by defining its terms, by denying the converse, by giving illustrations or specific instances. He may establish it by proofs. He may develop it by showing its implications and consequences. Express a negative in positive form. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end. Usually the logical predicate, that is, the new element in the sentence. The principle that the proper place for what is to be made most prominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to the sentences of a paragraph, and to the paragraphs of a composition. Less refers to quantity, fewer to number.","This book is legendary, but I learned so much more from “On Writing Well” by William Zinsser.  That said, this book is very tiny, so maybe read it in an hour before reading “On Writing Well”, since that author references this book a few times."
Indistractable,Nir Eyal,9781948836531,2,"Even when we think we’re seeking pleasure, we’re actually driven by the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting. The drive to relieve discomfort is the root cause of all our behavior. Dissatisfaction propels us to do everything we do. Even selfless acts are motivated by our need to escape feelings of guilt and injustice. To master distraction, we must learn to deal with discomfort. Instead of suppressing urges, step back, notice, observe, and let the desire disappear naturally. Doing research is often just a diversion from difficult work. In a smoking cessation study, the participants who had learned to acknowledge and explore their cravings managed to quit at double the rate of those in the American Lung Association’s best-performing cessation program. Tell myself it’s fine to give in, but not right now. I have to wait just ten minutes. When you gently pay attention to negative emotions, they tend to dissipate - but positive ones expand. The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control actually leads to less self-control. Only by setting aside specific time in our schedules for traction (the actions that draw us toward what we want in life) can we turn our backs on distraction. Eliminate all white space on your calendar so you’re left with a template for how you intend to spend your time each day. Success is measured by whether you did what you planned to do. Ulysses pact: a freely made decision that is designed and intended to bind oneself in the future. It's pre-commitment.","A specific guide for how to avoid distraction in your life. 95% of it was how-to stuff I didn't find useful because I'm already doing all of it. If you're not, this book is much more useful to you. It had two interesting points for me: about dissatisfaction driving motivation, and filling your daily calendar with a template of how you want to spend your day."
The Tao of George Carlin,George Carlin,B01DMYLTUK,2,"Picketing, boycotting and letter-writing makes powerless people feel useful. The caterpillar does all the work, and the butterfly gets all the glory. Name six ways we’re better than chickens. See, nobody can do it! You know why? Because chickens are decent people. You don’t see chickens hanging around in drug gangs, do you? When’s the last chicken you heard about came home from work and beat the shit out of his hen, huh? Doesn’t happen. Because chickens are decent people. Cloud nine gets all the publicity, but cloud eight actually is cheaper, less crowded, and has a better view. Comedy is filled with surprise, so when I cross a line, I like to find out where the line might be and then cross it deliberately, and then make the audience happy about crossing the line with me. When they really laugh, their defenses are down. They are completely open, completely themselves when that message hits the brain and the laugh begins. That's when new ideas can be implanted. If a new idea slips in at that moment, it has a chance to grow. There's a humorous side to every situation. The challenge is to find it. There aren't too many people hooked on crack who can play the bagpipes. The earth doesn’t share our prejudice toward plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children. Culture is astonishingly amusing if you are emotionally detached from it. I have always viewed it from a safe distance, knowing I don't belong; it doesn't include me, and it never has. I do not identify with the group, no matter how you care to define it. (Country, race, religion, etc.) The larger the group, the more toxic, the more of your beauty as an individual you have to surrender for the sake of group thought. I don’t like team players. I like people who buck the system. Individualists. Never join a group that has a name. Hobbies cost money. Interests are quite free. When we assign a word to a thought, we’re stuck with that word for that thought. So be careful with words. No one knows what’s next, but everybody does it. Show me a lazy prick who's lying in bed all day, watching TV, only occasionally getting up to piss, and I'll show you a guy who's not causing any trouble. Some people have no idea what they're doing, and a lot of them are really good at it. Some people dream of things that never were and ask, “Why not?” Some people have to go to work and don’t have time for all that shit. Most people with low self-esteem have earned it. If you try to fail, and succeed, which have you done?",I liked the description - that great comedians are like philosophers - but the contents were just some quips.
21 Lessons for the 21st Century,Yuval Noah Harari,9780525512172,2,"I don’t have lessons to teach people in such situations. I can only hope to learn from them. Philosophers are very patient people, but engineers are far less so, and investors are the least patient of all. Panic is a form of hubris. It comes from the smug feeling that one knows exactly where the world is heading: down. Bewilderment is more humble and therefore more clear-sighted. Computers aren’t individuals, and it is easy to integrate them into a single flexible network. So compare the abilities of a collection of human individuals to the abilities of an integrated network. Armed forces need thirty people to operate every unmanned drone. Analyzing the resulting information occupies at least eighty people more. In 2015 the U.S. Air Force lacked sufficient trained humans to fill all these positions. It took AlphaZero Four hours to learn chess from scratch, by playing against itself. Since AlphaZero had learned nothing from any human, many of its winning moves and strategies seemed unconventional. Government regulation can successfully block new technologies even if they are commercially viable and economically lucrative. For example, for many decades we have had the technology to create a marketplace for human organs, complete with human “body farms” in underdeveloped countries and an almost insatiable demand from desperate affluent buyers. Such body farms could well be worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet regulations have prevented free trade in human body parts, and though there is a black market in organs, it is far smaller and more circumscribed than what one might have expected. In Scandinavia, governments follow the motto “Protect workers, not jobs.” When people design web pages, they often cater to the taste of the Google search algorithm rather than to the taste of any human being. The most important customer of all is an algorithm: the Google search algorithm. If we can just catch the eye of the algorithm, we can take the humans for granted. Referendums and elections are always about human feelings, not about human rationality. In the future, people will enjoy the best healthcare in history, but for precisely this reason they will probably be sick all the time. There is always something wrong somewhere in the body. There is always something that can be improved. Human emotions override philosophical theories. Seminarians in a rush will ignore people in distress. This disjunction between the seminary and the road is one of the biggest practical problems in ethics. Philosophers' skills put into computer algorithms could follow ethical guidelines much better than humans - provided we find a way to code ethics in precise numbers and statistics. If we could teach Kant, Mill, and Rawls to write code, they would be able to program the self-driving car to stop and help strangers in distress. We have seen too many science-fiction movies about robots rebelling against their human masters, yet they will probably always obey their masters and never rebel. Since robots have no emotions, they could be trusted to always adhere to the dry letter of the military code, and never be swayed by personal fears and hatreds. The massacre at My Lai never would have occurred. Yet if the code is ruthless and cruel, the results will be catastrophic. A ruthless dictator armed with such killer robots will never have to fear that his soldiers will turn against him, no matter how heartless or crazy his orders. Humans easily develop loyalty to small intimate groups such as a tribe, but not millions of utter strangers. Since there is no *national* answer to the problem of global warming, some nationalist politicians prefer to believe the problem does not exist. They are not racist. They are “culturist.” Traditional racism is waning, but the world is now full of “culturists.” Norms and values that are appropriate in one country just don’t work well under different circumstances. Saying that people tend to commit crimes because they have substandard genes is out; saying that they tend to commit crimes because they come from dysfunctional subcultures is very much in. Culturist arguments might occasionally make good sense, as in the case of different styles of human relations. Since human relations are crucial to many jobs, is it unethical for a Warmlander firm to penalize Coldians for behaving in accordance with their cultural legacy? Culturists often confuse local superiority with objective superiority. If you really want to understand Samoan culture, you will have to pack your bags and visit Samoa. When you clearly define a yardstick, a time, and a place, culturist claims may well be empirically sound. But all too often people adopt very general culturist claims that make little sense. The claim is just far too vague. What do we mean by “intolerant”? Intolerant of whom, or what? A culture can be intolerant toward religious minorities and unusual political views while simultaneously being very tolerant toward obese people or the elderly. Terrorists resemble a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so weak that it cannot move even a single teacup. So how does a fly destroy a china shop? It finds a bull, gets inside its ear, and starts buzzing. The bull goes wild with fear and anger, and destroys the china shop. This is what happened after 9/11, as Islamic fundamentalists incited the American bull to destroy the Middle Eastern china shop. Now they flourish in the wreckage. And there is no shortage of short-tempered bulls in the world. The less political violence in a particular state, the greater the public shock at an act of terrorism. Killing a few people in Belgium draws far more attention than killing hundreds in Nigeria or Iraq. Paradoxically, then, the very success of modern states in preventing political violence makes them particularly vulnerable to terrorism. Citizens have become used to zero political violence. That is why the theater of terror generates visceral fears of anarchy, making people feel as if the social order is about to collapse. People confidently replied that they understood zippers very well - after all, they use them all the time. They were then asked to describe in as much detail as possible all the steps involved in the zipper’s operation. Most people had no idea. This is the knowledge illusion. We think we know a lot, even though individually we know very little, because we treat knowledge in the minds of others as if it were our own. When a thousand people believe some made-up story for one month, that’s fake news. When a billion people believe it for a thousand years, that’s a religion. Humans prefer power to truth. We try to control the world than on trying to understand it - and even when we try to understand it, we usually do so in the hope that understanding the world will make it easier to control. If you want reliable information, pay good money for it. (Paid news sources instead of free.) If some issue seems exceptionally important to you, make the effort to read the relevant scientific literature. Whenever you see a movie about an AI in which the AI is female and the scientist is male, it’s probably a movie about feminism rather than cybernetics. For why on earth would an AI have a sex? Everything you will ever experience in life is within your own mind. Traveling to Fiji won’t make any difference. There are not special emotions and feelings that you can have only in Fiji. Whatever you can feel in Fiji, you can feel anywhere. The last thing people need is more information. Instead, people need the ability to make sense of information, to tell the difference between what is important and what is unimportant, and above all to combine many bits of information into a broad picture of the world. Critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. The ability to deal with change, learn new things, and preserve your mental balance in unfamiliar situations - to reinvent yourself again and again. Immemorial life was divided into two complementary parts: a period of learning followed by a period of working. In the first part of life you accumulated information, developed skills, constructed a worldview, and built a stable identity. In the second part of life you relied on your accumulated skills to navigate the world, earn a living, and contribute to society. You continued to learn, just small tweaks to your well-honed abilities. “Who am I?” will be a more urgent and complicated question than ever before. If you try to hold on to some stable identity, job, or worldview, you risk being left behind as the world flies by you with a whoosh. Past experiences will become less reliable guides. To survive and flourish in such a world, you will need a lot of mental flexibility and great reserves of emotional balance. You will have to repeatedly let go of some of what you know best, and learn to feel at home with the unknown. If you don’t know what you want in life, it will be all too easy for technology to shape your aims for you and take control of your life. As it will become easier to manipulate people’s deepest emotions and desires, and it will become more dangerous than ever to just follow your heart. Work very hard at getting to know your operating system better - to know what you are and what you want from life. You have to run faster than the algorithms - get to know yourself before they do. To run fast, don’t take much baggage with you. Leave all your illusions behind. When people ask about the meaning of life, they expect to be told a story. To give meaning to my life, a story needs to satisfy just two conditions. First, it must give me some role to play. Second, it must extend beyond my horizons. The story must provide me with an identity and give meaning to my life by embedding me within something bigger than myself. It takes surprisingly little to exhaust our imagination. The meaning of life is thus a bit like playing with a live hand grenade. Once you pass it on to somebody else, you are safe. When you are in love, by connecting with a single body here and now, you feel connected with the entire cosmos. If you are really in love with someone, you never worry about the meaning of life. Any story is wrong, simply for being a story. The universe just does not work like a story. “Hoc est corpus!” got garbled into “Hocus-pocus!” Men sacrifice their lives for a colorful ribbon. If you want to know the ultimate truth of life, rites and rituals are a huge obstacle. But if you are interested in social stability and harmony, truth is often a liability, whereas rites and rituals are among your best allies. Most people don’t like to admit that they are fools. The more they sacrifice for a particular belief, the stronger their faith becomes. The universe is only a meaningless hodgepodge of atoms. Nothing is inherently beautiful, sacred, or sexy; human feelings make it so. The real enigma of life is not what happens after you die but what happens before you die. You want to know what anger is? Well, just observe the sensations that arise and pass through your body while you are angry. Whenever I was angry, I focused on the object of my anger - something somebody did or said - rather than on the sensory reality of the anger.","His book “Sapiens” was amazing, so I read this new one. It’s just some thoughts on our present and near future. Not so different from what you find in every-day articles. I’m personally averse to news commentaries, so I shouldn’t have read this. Still, some interesting ideas, and the last chapter was great."
The Geometry of Wealth,Brian Portnoy,0857196715,2,"Three important steps: Define purpose: Illuminate the ingredients for a life well-lived Set priorities: Chart a focused strategy to do the right things in the right order Make decisions: Employ simplified tactics to drive better outcomes Wealth is funded contentment - the ability to underwrite a meaningful life. Priority #1 is risk management. It is to protect ourselves from the potential for loss, especially catastrophe. The proper mindset values avoiding mistakes over demonstrating brilliance. Nothing is so bitter that a calm mind cannot find comfort in it. The more information we gather, the worse choices we make. The more information we gather, the more compelled we feel to make decisions. We don’t like to harvest new information but then do nothing with it. It feels like wasted effort. Deliberation hinders satisfaction. At a certain point, putting too much thought into something undermines the value. Comparison shopping is mentally exhausting. Experiences are more immune to hedonic adaptation. They are harder to get used to, unlike material goods. Smaller, frequent experiences better defy the hedonic treadmill. Pay a small cost to avoid a potential catastrophe. And if the small cost led to large gains, even better. Survive. In the wild, rule one is stay alive. After that, it’s all upside. To achieve great things in life, to come out ahead, to make great investment returns, you need to put your capital at risk (human, financial, social, or otherwise). That could be paying for a pricey education, investing in the stock market, or asking the prettiest girl to the prom. But taking more risk does not produce greater returns. Instead, taking more risk increases the variability of future outcomes. If there were a reliable relationship between more risk and bigger rewards, then technically you wouldn’t be taking more risk. Everyone would bet long shots all the time. We want to be more right than others - to leverage our edge. Choosing the right pre-school, anticipating the next storm. At least at the start, we don’t want to be more right, we want to be less wrong. This is winning by not losing. The aim should be to control risk: “risk control” not “risk avoidance”. Great investors naturally think about being less wrong. They patiently wait until the odds are so stacked in their favor it would be foolish not to bet. Focus on minimizing the damage. Win not by making valid predictions but by allowing yourself to correct false ones. People may believe that who they are today is pretty much who they will be tomorrow, despite the fact that it isn’t who they were yesterday. Take the time to think differently about common problems. Always invert. Immunize your liabilities before you maximize your assets. To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most realize. To achieve superior results is harder than it looks.",I was expecting something more philosophical. Instead mostly just got advice to protect the downside.
Peak Performance,Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness,162336793X,2,"Set a goal on the outer boundaries of what you think is possible, then systematically pursue it. Periodization: Balance the right amount of stress with the right amount of rest. Stress + rest = growth. Challenge is followed by a slight dip in function. But after you rest and recover, you adapt and become stronger, to push a little harder in the future. Figure out the right balance, so you don’t either get hurt or burn out (too much stress, not enough rest) or become complacent and plateau (not enough stress, too much rest). Stress demands rest, and rest supports stress. Almost all great intellectual and creative performers do: 1.Immersion: deep focus on work 2.Incubation: rest, not thinking about work 3.Insight: “aha”: new ideas and growth The more you resist temptation, think deeply, or focus intensely, the better you get at it. Growth comes at the point of resistance. You learn by pushing yourself to the outer reaches of your abilities. Students who were forced to struggle on complex problems before receiving help from teachers outperformed students who received immediate assistance. Don’t multitask. Ever. Compartmentalize your day down to the hour. Each compartment has a concrete objective. Be fully intentional with how you spend your time. Elite runners feel pain and discomfort during their hard workouts, but they react differently. Rather than panicking, they have a calm conversation: “This is starting to hurt now. It should. I’m running hard. But I am separate from this pain. It is going to be okay.” Like meditation, choose how to respond to the stress of a workout. Walking tends to be more effective at fostering creativity than other movements that require greater focus. Being in nature, or even just looking at pictures of nature, helps with the transition from stress to rest and promotes creative thinking. Use a writing-only computer. When an object is isolated for a specific task, the link between subject (writer) and object (computer) strengthens. Over time, the mere sight of that specific computer invites writing. Link key activities to the same context (e.g., time of day, physical environment). Decision fatigue: Judges granted prisoners parole 65 percent of the time at the beginning of the day, but nearly zero percent of the time at the end of the day. Physicians make significantly more prescribing errors as the day wears on. Physical fatigue occurs not in the body, but in the brain. The brain comes in and creates a perception of failure before we actually harm ourselves. We constantly weigh how hard something feels against our motivation to do it. When perception of effort is unbalanced with the motivation, we slow down or ease up until the two are balanced. The more motivated we are, the greater the effort we are willing to tolerate. You can improve your performance by either decreasing your perception of effort (training so that it feels easier) or by increasing your motivation.","A fine summary of the other books on the subject of performance, deliberate practice, mastery, willpower, etc. But I’ve read all the books that this one references, so this had nothing new for me. If you haven’t read those others, this would be a good starting book for you."
Money: Master the Game,Tony Robbins,1476757860,2,"Ray Dalio says to cover: 1. higher than expected inflation (rising prices) 2. lower than expected inflation (or deflation) 3. higher than expected economic growth 4. lower than expected economic growth. 30% in stocks 15% in intermediate term [7-10 year Treasuries] 40% in long-term bonds [20-25 year Treasuries] 7.5% in gold 7.5% in commodities The portfolio must be rebalanced. Meaning, when one segment does well, you must sell a portion and reallocate back to the original allocation. This should be done at least annually. Wharton professor Dr. David Babbel says annuities are one of the most important investment vehicles we have. Annuities, which basically allow you to go to an insurance company and say, ‘You know what? I am going to take my money and put it with you, you’re going to manage it, grow it, and you’re going to pay me back income every month for as long as I live.’ Five types of annuities that could change your life. There are really only two general categories of annuities: immediate annuities and deferred annuities. Immediate annuities are best used for those at retirement age or beyond. An immediate annuity is really a form of income insurance. “Yes, but if you die early, they keep your money!” You are dead, who cares?! Deferred annuity. This simply means you give the insurance company money either in one lump sum or over a period of years, and instead of receiving an immediate income, your returns are reinvested in a tax-deferred environment so that when you’re ready you can, at will, turn on the income stream you want for the rest of your life. There are roughly only three primary types of deferred annuities. They are: 1. Fixed annuity: This is where you get a fixed, guaranteed rate of return every year (independent of any stock market ups or downs), very much like you would receive with a CD or bond, but the rates are different. 2. Indexed annuity: This is where your rate of return is tied to how the stock market does, but you get a percentage of the upside of the market (not all) with no downside and no possibility of loss. 3. Hybrid “indexed” annuity: This is where you get the benefits of an indexed annuity with the addition of a “lifetime income” rider. This lifetime income feature gives you the ability to turn on a paycheck for life! A guarantee is only as good as the insurance company that issues it, so highly rated insurance companies are key. There are insurance guaranty associations run by the state insurance departments that will guarantee up to a certain amount/deposit of the product you buy. Essentially every insurance company that operates in that state is basically agreeing to insure all the other ones. Variable annuities should be avoided. Guaranteed rate of return (for instance, 3% or 4%) for a specific period of time (like 5-10 years). The money grows tax deferred, and at the end of the term, you have a few options. You can walk away with your money, you can “roll your money” into a new annuity and keep the tax protection, or you can convert your account balance into a guaranteed lifetime income. There are no annual fees in a fixed deferred annuity. A fixed deferred annuity offers a specific longevity insurance Guaranteed rates of income from, for example, age 80 or 85 until your passing. Since I am only 54, my payments at age 85 would be $83,000 per year for the same onetime $100,000 deposit today! The day I make the deposit, I’m given a schedule of what the annual income payments will be at any age I want to begin taking income. Deferred fixed-income annuity. Income insurance payments Advanced-life deferred annuity, which is essentially longevity insurance. A fixed indexed annuity (FIA). A powerful financial product, a hybrid annuity, that gives us great upside potential during its growth phase but also provides a guaranteed lifetime income down the road, Two relatively new types of deferred annuities that have surged in popularity since they were introduced in the early 1990s: 1. the indexed annuity, where the rate of your return is tied to a stock index, and . . . 2. the even more popular hybrid version, where you get both a fixed rate of return and the option of a return tied to the growth of the stock market index as well as a guaranteed lifetime income feature. These hybrid annuities are more commonly known as fixed indexed annuities, with a lifetime income rider or a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit. • In a fixed indexed annuity, your deposits remain entirely in your control. You are not giving up access to your cash. • It offers the potential for significantly higher annual returns than other safe-money solutions such as CDs or bonds. • It provides a 100% guarantee of your principal - you can’t lose money. • The growth is tax-deferred, providing maximum compounded growth for the expansion of your Freedom Fund. • It provides income insurance, or a guaranteed income for life, when you select an optional income rider. A fixed indexed annuity is fixed, which means your account is guaranteed never to go down. No matter what happens, you will not lose your original deposit. If the market index drops, even if it’s one of those nasty 20%, 30%, or 50% drawdown years, you don’t lose a dime. Advisors Excel is now the largest annuity wholesaler in the country. The minimum age for most fixed indexed annuities was 50 or 55. Selecting the right annuity products for your specific situation: www.lifetimeincome.com. Private placement life insurance (PPLI), Here are the astounding benefits available to all: • unlimited deposit amounts (with no income limitations) • no tax on the growth of your investments • no tax when accessed (if structured correctly) • any money left over for your heirs cannot be taxed. Think of it as an ‘insurance wrapper’ you are buying to place around your investments. Your deposits will be legally sheltered from tax in this insurance wrapper. They can be invested in a variety of different funds, and you will not pay tax on the growth or when you access your cash if we do it right.” There are very strict rules around the investment management, which must be done by a third-party investment professional, not the policy owner. You will have to pay tax if you take a withdrawal. But - and it’s a huge but - you also have the ability to “borrow” from your policy. In other words, you can call the insurance company and access your cash value, but it’s legally deemed and actually is a loan - and loans are not taxable. You can repay the loans at a future date of your choosing or allow the life insurance proceeds to pay off the loans when you pass away. It’s a legitimate loan, and it does get paid off. One more huge benefit to stack on? Life insurance death benefit proceeds are income tax free when your kids receive the benefit. In order to access PPLI, you must be what’s called an accredited investor and the typical minimum annual deposits are $250,000 for a minimum of four years. There is a “version” of PPLI that is now available to nonaccredited investors: www.tiaa-cref.org/public Don’t wait to set up a living trust. Everyone needs one. Even though each of these financial legends has a distinct approach, I found that they share common obsessions: 1. Don’t Lose. All of these masters, while driven to deliver extraordinary returns, are even more obsessed with making sure they don’t lose money. Defense is ten times more important than offense. You have to be very focused on the downside at all times. 2. Risk a Little to Make a Lot. He doesn’t make an investment until he can potentially get a return of at least $5 for every $1 he risks. 3. Anticipate and Diversify. === When you have a good position in something, you don’t need to look at it; it will take care of itself. Where you need to be focused is where you’re losing money. Risk control is the number one single most important focus that I have, every day. You always want to be with whatever the predominant trend is. You don’t ever want to be a contrarian investor. My metric for everything I look at is the 200-day moving average of closing prices. “How do I keep from losing everything?” If you use the 200-day moving average rule, then you get out. You play defense, and you get out. Get out of anything that falls below the 200-day moving average. You sell an asset only when you think you have found a different asset that’s a 50% better bargain. Money is a good servant but a bad master. - Sir Francis Bacon The secret to wealth is simple: Find a way to do more for others than anyone else does. Become more valuable. Do more. Give more. Be more. Serve more. We all need to feel important, special, unique, or needed. So how do some of us get significance? You can get significance by having more or bigger problems than anybody. Spending a lot of money can make you feel significant, and so can spending very little. Sam Walton drove around Bentonville, Arkansas, in his old pickup, demonstrating he didn’t need a Bentley - but, of course, he did have his own private fleet of jets standing by. The secret to living is giving.","Though it has some great information and mindset advice, holy crap it's so damn verbose - 688 pages! - which keeps me from recommending it.  But it might be worth skimming to find specific things you're looking for.  I had never heard of annuities or private placement life insurance.  (That said, I don't want them.)  What a weird mix of for-dummies and super-sophisticated advice."
Simple Rules: How to Thrive in a Complex World,Donald Sull,0544409906,2,"Simple rules are shortcut strategies that save time and effort by focusing our attention and simplifying the way we process information. The rules aren’t universal - they’re tailored to the particular situation and the person using them. Simple rules allow people to act without having to stop and rethink every decision. Simple rules apply to a well-defined activity or decision. Rules that cover multiple activities or choices end up as vague platitudes. Simple rules are tailored to the person using them. Use simple rules not as a mechanistic tool but as guidelines within which they exercise judgment. Three types of rules that improve decision making by structuring choices and centering on what to do (and what not to do). Boundary rules can help you decide between two mutually exclusive alternatives to pick which opportunities to pursue and which to reject. Prioritizing rules rank options to decide which alternatives will receive limited resources. Useful when you lack sufficient resources or time to do everything, or when people hold conflicting views about what to do. Stopping rules dictate when to reverse a decision. They provide guidance: On when to sell a stock, end the search for a mate. Burglars used a single rule to pick their target: “Avoid houses with a vehicle parked outside.” An important benefit of boundary rules - they narrow down the alternatives. PRIORITIZING RULES: Medical triage: Prioritize for care those wounded soldiers who can be saved but only if treated immediately. Whenever alternatives present themselves sequentially (as opposed to appearing all at once), the question of when to stop searching and make a choice arises. Tendency among human decision makers, known as the status quo bias, leads individuals to hold ’em when they should fold ’em Stopping rules can help investors by providing some guidance on when to sell their assets. Rule: “If an investment loses 10 percent of its initial value, sell it.” Did not intend his rule to be applied mindlessly. Detest a mechanistic formula for anything. Concrete guidance on how to be creative gave the students an effective starting point and channeled their creativity. In contrast, the group that was encouraged to be creative without any simple rules performed no better than the group that was simply given the assignment. Artists work by imposing constraints on themselves. Elmore Leonard: simple rules of writing, which include “Avoid prologues,” “Never use a verb other than ‘said’ to carry dialogue,” and “Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.”","Not a book that gives you simple rules. Instead it's on the meta-topic of simple rules. Gives examples from medicine, crime, gambling, investing, etc."
Quirkology,Richard Wiseman,0465090796,2,"Quirkology uses scientific methods to study the more curious aspects of everyday life. High self-monitors tend to be concerned with how other people see them. They are happy being the center of attention, can easily adapt their behavior to suit the situation in which they find themselves, and are skilled at manipulating how others see them. We don’t smile simply because we are happy, but rather to let others know that we are happy. Only 4 percent of bowlers smiled when they obtained a good score, but they were facing away from their colleagues. However, when the bowlers turned around and looked at their friends, 42 percent of them had a huge smile. Many people become superstitious to help them cope with uncertainty. Almost every week in Britain, a truly amazing coincidence takes place, an event that we know is extremely unlikely to happen by chance alone. In fact, the odds of this event’s happening are 15 million to one: Someone wins the lottery jackpot. Why does this unlikely event routinely happen week after week? Because a huge number of people buy lottery tickets. It is exactly the same with other coincidences. There are millions of people in the world living complex lives, and so it is not surprising that once in a while someone wins the coincidence jackpot and experiences a genuinely unlikely event. The room contained a low-frequency sound wave that fell below the human hearing threshold. These waves, usually referred to as “infrasound,” can’t be heard, they carry a relatively large amount of energy, and so are capable of producing weird effects. The potential to vibrate the chest, affect respiration, and produce gagging, headaches, and coughing. Additional research suggested that certain frequencies can also cause vibration of the eyeballs and therefore the distortion of vision. The waves can also move small objects and surfaces and even cause the strange flickering of a candle flame. Vic speculated that some buildings contain infrasound (perhaps caused by strong winds blowing across an open window, or the rumble of nearby traffic), and that the strange effects of such low-frequency waves might cause some people to believe that the place is haunted. People whose hearts were already beating faster would be more likely to find someone attractive. When the men on the high bridge were approached by the female market researcher, they unconsciously attributed their increased heart rates to her rather than to the bridge. Two ducks were sitting in a pond. One of the ducks said: “Quack.” The other duck said: “I was going to say that!” Those who had their faces forced into a smile felt happier. Words featuring the k sound force the face into a smile. This may account for why we associate the sound with happiness: the “comedy k” effect. Woody Allen once remarked: “Most of the time I don’t have much fun, the rest of the time I don’t have fun at all.” Man goes to a psychoanalyst. The analyst gets out a stack of cards containing ink blots, shows them to the man one at a time, and asks him to say what the ink-blots remind him of. The man looks at the first ink blot and says, “Sex.” Then he looks at the second ink blot and says, “Sex,” again. In fact, he goes through the whole stack of images, saying the word “sex” in response to every one. The psychiatrist looks concerned and says, “I don’t wish to worry you, but you seem to have sex on the mind.” The man looks surprised, and answers, “I can’t believe you just said that—you are the one with all the dirty pictures.” There is a natural incompatibility between religious fundamentalism and humor. The creation and appreciation of humor requires a sense of playfulness, an enjoyment of incongruity (“Two fish in a tank . . . ”), and a high tolerance for uncertainty. Humor also frequently involves mixing elements that don’t go together, that threaten authority, and that contain sexually explicit material. In addition, the act of laughter involves a loss of self-control and self-discipline. All these elements, argues Saroglou, are the antithesis of religious fundamentalism. Humor is the shortest distance between two people. A dog goes into a telegraph office, takes a blank form, and writes: “Woof Woof. Woof Woof Woof. Woof Woof Woof Woof.” The clerk examines the paper and politely tells the dog: “There are only nine words here. You could send another ‘Woof’ for the same price.” The dog looks confused and replies, “But that would make no sense at all.” One shopper managed to get twenty-nine items through the express line. About 80 percent of the transgressors were female van drivers. 96 percent of female van drivers exceeded the speed limit, compared to just 86 percent of male van drivers. 94 percent of motorists failed to comply with the sign, versus 99 percent of female van drivers. People parking their vehicles in a prohibited fire zone at a shopping center. Again, female van drivers were the least compliant, accounting for about 35 percent of all violations. He has speculated that women are still getting used to their newfound power in society, and may have developed an unconscious need to outdo behaviors previously associated with men, such as breaking speed limits, parking in restricted areas, and ignoring traffic signs. 1997, U.S. News and World Report conducted a poll in which they asked Americans who was “somewhat likely” to go to heaven. Bill Clinton didn’t do too badly, with 52 percent of respondents thinking that he would be welcome at the pearly gates. Diana, Princess of Wales, fared a little better with 60 percent of the vote, and in second place came Mother Teresa with 79 percent. But who won the poll, scoring a massive 87 percent? Most people placed themselves on top. People in high-population cities tend to experience a greater amount of “sensory overload.” They are constantly being bombarded with information from other people, their cell phones, traffic, and advertising. As a result, they do what all systems tend to do when receiving too much information—they set priorities, and they spend less time dealing with the sources competing for their attention. Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and San Jose (Costa Rica) heading the list of highly helpful countries. Lilongwe (Malawi) in Africa came in third. Singapore (Singapore), New York (United States), and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) filled the bottom three places. The differences were far from trivial. In Rio de Janeiro and Lilongwe, “blind” experimenters were helped across the street on every occasion, whereas in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur they encountered only a 50 percent success rate. Zimbardo secretly filmed what happened when he left a used car unlocked with its hood up on a street opposite New York University. After just ten minutes, a passing car stopped and a family got out. The mother quickly removed items of value from the interior of the car, the father removed the radiator with a hacksaw, and their child rooted through the trunk. About fifteen minutes later, another two men jacked up the car and removed its tires. Over the next few hours, other people stripped the vehicle until nothing of value remained. In just two days, Zimbardo secretly filmed more than twenty instances of destruction (mostly committed by middle-class white adults in broad daylight), and the resulting carnage was so bad that two trucks were required to remove the wrecked car from the street. Zimbardo then left a similar car (again with its hood raised) in a location that had a much greater sense of community—opposite Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. In stark contrast to the events that took place in New York City, not one instance of vandalism was recorded over the course of a week. When it started to rain, one passerby lowered the car’s hood to protect the motor. When Zimbardo eventually went to remove the car, three people called the police to report that an abandoned car was being stolen. ---- 2nd reading in 2019: The universal horoscope: You have a need for other people to like and admire you. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as an independent thinker, and do not accept others’ statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic. Chronopsychology: study of time and mind. Lucky people were optimistic, energetic, and open to new opportunities and experiences. Unlucky people were more withdrawn, clumsy, anxious about life, and unwilling to make the most of the opportunities that came their way. Novelty and sensation seeking are fundamental aspects of our personalities. High sensation seekers can’t stand watching movies that they have seen before, enjoy being around unpredictable people, and are attracted to dangerous sports such as mountain climbing or bungee-rope jumping. Low sensation seekers like to see the same movies again and again, enjoy the comfortable familiarity of old friends, and don’t like visiting places that they haven’t been to before. The month in which people are born exerts a small, but real, influence over the way in which they behave. Those with summer births were the risk takers. Those born in the summer (March to August) also rated themselves as luckier than those born in the winter (September to February). The resulting levels of luckiness across the twelve months showed an undulating pattern that peaked in May and was at its lowest in October. Only June failed to fit the pattern - something that we put down to a statistical blip. Those born in the summer months of the Southern Hemisphere (September to February) considered themselves significantly luckier than those born in winter (March to August). The rich and famous were prepared to misreport their birthdays so that they could bask in the reflected glory of well-known days of the year. Louis Armstrong claimed to have been born on July 4. However, he was actually born on August 4. Some parents deliberately misreported the dates of their children’s births to make the events seem astrologically “auspicious.” Such parents could have then subsequently provided their children with the schooling, and other resources, required to turn these alleged “heavenly predictions” into self-fulfilling prophecies. Three American presidents, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe, all died on July 4, thus raising the intriguing possibility that they held on long enough to ensure an auspicious date of death. Chinese death records around the event showed that the death rate dipped by 35 percent in the week before the festival and peaked by the same amount in the week after. A woman is more likely to die during the week after her birthday than at any other time of the year. A man is more likely to die during the week before his birthday. Men in the “pessimistic” group were far more likely to die from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and accidents than those in the “neutral” group. Men in the “optimistic” group exhibited a far lower mortality rate than those in the other two groups. Most people tell about two important lies each day. A third of conversations involve some form of deception. Four in five lies remain undetected. More than 60 percent of adults have cheated on their partners at least once. High self-monitors tend to draw the letter Q in a way in which it could be seen by someone facing them. Low self-monitors tend to draw the letter Q in a way in which it could be read by themselves. High self-monitors tend to be concerned with how other people see them. They are happy being the center of attention, can easily adapt their behavior to suit the situation in which they find themselves, and are skilled at manipulating how others see them. As a result, they tend to be good at lying. Low self-monitors come across as being the “same person” in different situations. Their behavior is guided more by their inner feelings and values, and they are less aware of their impact on those around them. They also tend to lie less in life, and therefore are not as skilled at deceit as high self-monitors. People tried their best to identify lies. None of the groups performed better than chance. On lying: Body language is often so misleading. Use of language becomes a far more reliable guide to the truth. Liars tend to say less, and to provide fewer details, than truth-tellers. Liars include fewer references to themselves, and their feelings. Truth-tellers know that they have forgotten certain details and are happy to admit it. We don’t smile simply because we are happy, but rather to let others know that we are happy. Subliminal messages: The lack of evidence to support a link between televised subliminal messages and behavior has not stopped present-day politicians from worrying about the possible effect of subtle signals on voters. Those with unusual names were significantly more likely than the control group to be diagnosed as psychotic. Online dating profiles: 70 percent “this is me” versus 30 percent “this is what I am looking for” balance attracted the greatest number of replies. A serious work in philosophy could be written entirely of jokes. We help people who are like us - similar in age, background, and fashion sense. It all makes sense from an evolutionary viewpoint. People who look and behave like us are more likely than others to be genetically related to us, or at least from the same tribe.","Cute stories about surprising research on curious aspects of everyday life. I loved these stories the first time I heard them : in everyone else's books. If I would have read this book first, I might have loved it. This author is the one who did the original studies, but his work has been so quoted by others that I found myself quickly skimming through, too familiar."
Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking,Richard Nisbett,66098619,2,"Darwin’s theory of natural selection owes a great deal to Adam Smith’s theory that societal wealth is created by rational actors pursuing their own selfish interests. So much of mental life is inaccessible. Statistics are essential for reasoning about a huge variety of problems. What’s needed is the ability to code events and objects in such a way that rough-and-ready versions of statistical principles can be applied to them. The situations we find ourselves in affect our thoughts and determine our behavior far more than people’s dispositions. Female-named hurricanes don’t seem as dangerous as male-named ones, so people take fewer precautions. Know as much as you possibly can about what kinds of stimuli produce what kinds of effects. A book by Adam Alter called Drunk Tank Pink. A less obvious implication of our susceptibility to “incidental” stimuli is the importance of encountering objects - and especially people - in a number of different settings if a judgment about them is to be of any consequence. That way, incidental stimuli associated with given encounters will tend to cancel one another out, resulting in a more accurate impression. Abraham Lincoln once said, “I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better.” To Lincoln’s adage, I’d add: Vary the circumstances of the encounters as much as possible. Monk 1 asked his abbot whether it would be all right to smoke while he prayed. Scandalized, the abbot said, “Of course not; that borders on sacrilege.” Monk 2 asked his abbot whether it would be all right to pray while he smoked. “Of course,” said the abbot, “God wants to hear from us at any time.” The lesson here is one of the most powerful in all psychology. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. Remember that all perceptions, judgments, and beliefs are inferences and not direct readouts of reality. The situation confronting another person may be impossible for me to see. So I’m particularly likely to underestimate the importance of the situation for another’s behavior. We trust people we ought not to, we avoid people who really are perfectly nice, all because we fail to recognize situational forces that may be operating on the person’s behavior. It’s past behavior over the long run, observed in many diverse situations, that is the excellent predictor, not behavior observed in only a few situations, especially a few situations all of the same type. We should choose our acquaintances carefully because we’re going to be highly influenced by them. This is especially true for young people: the younger you are, the more influenced you are by peers’ attitudes and behaviors.7 One of a parent’s most important and challenging roles is to make sure their children’s acquaintances are likely to be good influences. In a book called The Geography of Thought, I proposed that these different social orientations were economic in origin.16 Greek livelihoods were based on relatively solitary occupations such as trading, fishing, and animal husbandry, and on agricultural practices such as kitchen gardens and olive tree plantations. Chinese livelihoods were based on agricultural practices, especially rice cultivation, requiring much more cooperation. Autocracy (often benevolent, sometimes not) was perhaps an efficient way of running a society where every man for himself was not an option. So it was necessary for Chinese to pay attention to social context in a way that it wasn’t for Greeks. Pay more attention to context. This will improve the odds that you’ll correctly identify situational factors that are influencing your behavior and that of others. Realize that other people think their behavior is more responsive to situational factors than you’re inclined to think - and they’re more likely to be right than you are. They almost certainly know their current situation - and their relevant personal history - better than you do. Recognize that people can change. Westerners have believed that the world is largely static and that objects, including people, behave as they do because of their unalterable dispositions. Belief in mutability is generally both more correct and more useful than a belief in stasis. When many people were involved in surveying land, it made sense to require that almost every student entering a top college know something of trigonometry. Today, a basic grounding in probability, statistics and decision analysis makes far more sense. Microeconomics is the study of the way individuals, corporations, and entire societies make choices. Microeconomists are also in the habit of telling us how we should make decisions. The tongue-in-cheek name that some behavioral economists use to describe their enterprise is “libertarian paternalism.” These economists will tell you how to make choices and arrange the world so that you’ll be likely to make good ones. But they’re not forcing you. You can always choose to ignore the choices they steer you toward making. If our beliefs are incongruent with our behavior, something has to change: either our beliefs or our behavior. We don’t have direct control over our beliefs but we do have control over our behavior. And because dissonance is a noxious state, our beliefs move into line with our behavior. Change people’s behavior and their hearts and minds will follow. Our decision making is characterized by bounded rationality. The rest of your life begins now. Nothing that happened yesterday can be retrieved. Marriage is for getting over the periods of unlove. Sending people a twenty-dollar voucher they can use for ticket purchase nets 70 percent more ticket sales than mailing them a letter with a promo code for a twenty-dollar discount. People don’t want to lose money by failing to cash in on the voucher they possess; but they’re willing to forgo the possible gain of using the promo code Offering to increase pay for teachers if the academic achievement of their students improved had no effect on student performance. Giving teachers the same amount of money at the beginning of the term and telling them they would have to pay back that amount if their students failed to meet a specified target resulted in a significant positive effect on student performance. Children who got the award after having contracted to draw with the markers in order to win it drew with the markers less than half as much as children who got an unanticipated award or no reward at all. The young contractors realized that drawing with the markers was something they did in order to get something they wanted. The other children could only infer that they were drawing with the markers because they wanted to. The people who tell you to give away every article of clothing you haven’t used for a year are right. Frame everyday life events in such a way that the relevance of statistical principles is obvious and you can make contact with them. Code the events in such a way that approximate versions of statistical rules can be applied to them. Performance is a variable, and regression to the mean is expected after an especially good performance - or an especially bad performance. An execution that’s better than average is expected on probabilistic grounds alone to be followed by something closer to the mean, that is, worse. An execution worse than average is expected to get better. Detecting covariation (or correlation): you have to pay attention to all four cells in order to be able to answer the simple question about association. Compute the ratio comparing the number of people who don’t have the disease but do have the symptom with the number of people who don’t have the disease and don’t have the symptom. Since the two ratios are the same, you know that the symptom is not associated with the disease. Often a given correlation is so consistent with plausible ideas about causation that we tacitly accept that the correlation establishes that there is a causal relation. Causal inferences are often irresistible. If I tell you that people who eat more chocolate have more acne, it’s hard to resist the assumption that something about chocolate causes acne. (It doesn’t, so far as is known.) Inquiry is fatal to certainty. - Will Durant, philosopher There is a fairly plausible hypothesis called the “germ exposure theory” that could account for the correlational and natural experiment evidence. Now are you ready to get your baby dirty? Personally, I’m not sure I would be. Natural experiments, correlational evidence, and plausible theories are all well and good. But I would want to see a true experiment of the double-blind, randomized control sort, with babies assigned by the proverbial flip of a coin to an experimental high-bacteria exposure condition versus a control, low-bacteria condition. Both the experimenter and the participants (the mothers in this case) should be ignorant of (blind to) the condition the babies were assigned to. Ignorance resulting from this double-blind design rules out the possibility that results could have been influenced by either the experimenter’s or the participant’s knowing what condition the participant was in. Assumptions tend to be wrong. Scared Straight kids to be more likely to commit crimes than kids in the control group who were exposed to no intervention at all. D.A.R.E., as it has been conducted for the past thirty years at least, doesn’t decrease children’s use of drugs. Why doesn’t D.A.R.E. work? We don’t know. It would be nice if we did, but causal explanations are unnecessary. Studies that rely on correlations to establish a scientific fact can be hopelessly misleading. Experiments in which people (or objects of any kind) are assigned randomly to one treatment versus another (or no treatment at all) are in general far superior to research based on multiple regression analysis. Assumptions are so often wrong when it comes to human behavior that it’s essential to conduct experiments if at all possible to test any hypothesis about behavior that matters. Does classroom size affect learning? Are multivitamins good for your health? Is there employer prejudice against the long-term unemployed - simply because they’ve been out of a job for a long time? All the questions in this chapter ask whether some independent or predictor variable - an input or a presumed cause - affects some dependent or outcome variable - an output or an effect. Pragmatic reasoning schemas, that is, sets of rules useful for thinking about everyday life situations. They’re not concerned with truth or validity at all but with assessing whether a person’s conduct is proper. This branch of logic is called deontic, from the Greek deon, meaning duty. It deals with what kind of situation constitutes an obligation, what kind gives permission, what’s optional behavior, what’s beyond the call of duty, and what ought to be done. Highly general pragmatic reasoning schemas include Occam’s razor, the tragedy of the commons, Some powerful pragmatic reasoning schemas are merely empirical principles that facilitate correct solutions to a broad range of everyday problems. These include the fundamental attribution error, differently, loss aversion, the status quo bias.","Damn I wanted to like this. And even looking at my notes, I see there are some good points about clear thinking, especially by keeping context in mind. But maybe something in his writing style put me off. Not sure why.

Wilde in America,David M. Friedman,0393063178,2,"Celebrity, a word that once referred exclusively to persons of achievement, has expanded its meaning to include persons famous merely for being famous, a status won by manipulating the media. It is a worldview where fame isn’t the end product of a career but the beginning of one. Other Europeans came to learn about America; Wilde came so America could learn about him. The line between fame and notoriety could be blurry. Maybe even nonexistent. In the Victorian world Wilde was born in, fame accrued from one’s deeds, notoriety from one’s persona. The former was bestowed by others as a response to real-world accomplishments. The latter was usually accomplished by oneself, using an identity—or pose—created in one’s imagination. Flashy new category incorporating the best and worst of notoriety and fame. This is the status we now call celebrity. “Epigrams are always better than argument in conversation,” she said. And “paradox is the very essence of social wit.” Identity is a kind of fiction, and that being oneself is a form of playacting. Appearances have their own reality. The most important act of creativity is the creation of one’s image. It was not enough to stand up; one had to stand out. The true master of conversation, is the one who leavens seriousness with humor. Details are the enemy of good talk. The goal of any good conversationalist “is not to instruct but to divert, and to ask him, ‘Is that really true?’ He perfected a verbal trick: replacing a word in a sentence with its unexpected opposite. This sleight of tongue enabled him to take subjects that others deemed serious and treat them irreverently, or take matters that others thought trivial and treat them with great solemnity—producing amusement either way. “I can resist everything except temptation.” “If one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out.” “Don’t be led astray down the path of virtue.” “Only shallow people do not judge by appearances.” “I can sympathize with everything except suffering.” “True friends stab you in the front.” To make his photos more than portraits, which is to say, more than just images presenting an interesting face. He would make them pictures. The difference, he had learned from John Ruskin at Oxford, was that pictures tell a story. (Wilde’s belief in that distinction explains why he later chose the title The Picture of Dorian Gray for his only novel, rather than The Portrait of Dorian Gray.) Celebrity is contagious. Wilde planned to absorb the star power of as many American luminaries as he could while touring the States,",A fine biography of Oscar Wilde's unique approach to America. Best quote: “Other Europeans came to learn about America; Wilde came so America could learn about him.”
Complexity: A Guided Tour,Melanie Mitchell,0199798109,2,"A definition of the term complex system: a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution. An alternative definition of a complex system: a system that exhibits nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors. It’s the best possible time to be alive, when almost everything you thought you knew is wrong. Aristotle believed that earthly objects move in different ways depending on what they are made of. His scientific method was to let logic and common sense direct theory; the importance of testing the resulting theories by experiments is a more modern notion. Calculus, the branch of mathematics that describes motion and change. Physicists call the general study of motion mechanics. Mechanics is divided into two areas: kinematics, which describes how things move, and dynamics, which explains why things obey the laws of kinematics. A small error in initial conditions produce an enormous error in the final phenomenon. Prediction becomes impossible…. Linearity is a reductionist’s dream, and nonlinearity can sometimes be a reductionist’s nightmare. The logistic map, which is perhaps the most famous equation in the science of dynamical systems and chaos. The logistic map is an extremely simple equation and is completely deterministic: every xt maps onto one and only one value of xt+1. And yet the chaotic trajectories obtained from this map, at certain values of R, look very random—enough so that the logistic map has been used as a basis for generating pseudo-random numbers on a computer. Even if we have a simple model in which all the parameters are determined exactly, long-term prediction is nevertheless impossible. As R was increased from 2.0 to 4.0, iterating the logistic map for a given value of R first yielded a fixed point, then a period-two oscillation, then period four, then eight, and so on, until chaos was reached. In dynamical systems theory, each of these abrupt period doublings is called a bifurcation. This succession of bifurcations culminating in chaos has been called the “period doubling route to chaos.” 4.6692016, now called Feigenbaum’s constant. The discovery and understanding of chaos has produced a rethinking of many core tenets of science. Seemingly random behavior can emerge from deterministic systems, with no external source of randomness. Physicists have a specific meaning of “work” done by an object: the amount of force applied to the object multiplied by the distance traveled by the object in the direction that force was applied. Laws of thermodynamics apply to “isolated systems”—ones that do not exchange energy with any outside entity. First law: Energy is conserved. The total amount of energy in the universe is constant. Energy can be transformed from one form to another. However, energy can never be created or destroyed. Second law: Entropy always increases until it reaches a maximum value. It will never decrease on its own unless an outside agent works to decrease it. The second law is the only fundamental law of physics that distinguishes between past and future. All other laws are reversible in time. Shannon’s definition of information involves a source that sends messages to a receiver. “Average amount of surprise” - in which “surprise” means something like the “degree of uncertainty” the receiver had about what the source would send next. Kurt Gödel: incompleteness theorem showed that if arithmetic is consistent, then there are true statements in arithmetic that cannot be proved: “This statement is not provable.” Let’s call this statement “Statement A.” Now, suppose Statement A could indeed be proved. But then it would be false (since it states that it cannot be proved). That would mean a false statement could be proved—arithmetic would be inconsistent. Okay, let’s assume the opposite, that Statement A cannot be proved. That would mean that Statement A is true (because it asserts that it cannot be proved), but then there is a true statement that cannot be proved—arithmetic would be incomplete. Ergo, arithmetic is either inconsistent or incomplete. Turing’s first goal was to make very concrete this notion of definite procedure. The idea is that, given a particular problem to solve, you can construct a definite procedure for solving it by designing a Turing machine that solves it. Turing machines were put forth as the definition of “definite procedure,” Turing’s big result—there can be no definite procedure for solving the Halting problem. The Halting problem is an example that proves that the answer to the Entscheidungsproblem is “no”; not every mathematical statement has a definite procedure that can decide its truth or falsity. Darwin’s theory of evolution: Philosopher Daniel Dennett: If I were to give an award for the single best idea anyone has ever had, I’d give it to Darwin, ahead of Newton and Einstein and everyone else. In a single stroke, the idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm of life, meaning, and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law. Entropy decreases (living systems become more organized, seemingly more designed) as a result of the work done by natural selection. Since this is a simple problem, it would probably be pretty easy for a human to figure out a good strategy for Robby to follow. However, the point of genetic algorithms is that humans, being intrinsically lazy, don’t have to figure out anything; we just let computer evolution figure it out for us. Let’s use a genetic algorithm to evolve a good strategy for Robby. I knew that my strategy wasn’t perfect, but this little trick never occurred to me. Evolution can be pretty clever. GAs often come up with things we humans don’t consider.",Great for what it is. I'm embarrassed to admit most of it went over my head. I'm not interested enough in the subject to give it my full concentration. I might read it again some day when it's more applicable to my life.
Your Memory,Kenneth L. Higbee,1569246297,2,"Three stages: 1. Acquisition or encoding is learning the material in the first place. 2. Storage is keeping the material until it is needed. 3. Retrieval is finding the material and getting it back out when it is needed. Chunking can increase the limited capacity of short-term memory. 376315374264 can be remembered as 12 separate digits, but it is easier to remember as four chunks of 3 digits each: 376 - 315 - 374 - 264. One of the main determinants of how easy something is to learn is how meaningful it is to the learner. If it doesn’t make sense, it will be hard to learn. Rhyme can be used to impose meaning on material that is not inherently meaningful. Cookies, grapes, cheese, can opener, chicken, pie, butter, bananas, bread, pork, gum. Reorganize the items by categories: dairy - butter, cheese; bakery goods - cookies, pie, bread; meat - chicken, pork; fruit - grapes, bananas; and other - can opener, gum. Items in the middle part of a list will take longer to learn and will be harder to remember than will items at the beginning and end of the list. If the items you are learning do not have to be in a certain order, arrange them so that the more complex, less meaningful items are at the ends of the list and the simpler, more meaningful items are in the middle. In motels you enter your room directly from the outside, but in hotels you enter your room from the hallway. Continue learning beyond the point of bare mastery or of mere recall. Anxiety can interfere with memory even without a specific stressful situation being involved. French verbs that are conjugated with the helping verb “to be” is the name of a lady, MRS.

Mark Twain would actually draw the pictures representing his ideas, for remembering his speeches. We need only about 125 basic words to communicate in a new language. Then build interlocking chains of new words by linking them to the 125 basic words and increase your vocabulary until you become fluent in the language. The Link system: two steps. First, form a visual image for each item in the list to be learned. Second, associate the image for each item with the image for the next item. The Story system is a variant of the Link system in which you weave the items into a connecting story.","Read the book “Moonwalking With Einstein” instead.

The Philosophical Baby,Alison Gopnik,0312429843,2,"Babies not only learn more, but imagine more, care more, and experience more. Young children are actually smarter, more imaginative, more caring, and even more conscious than adults are. Developing a new theory about the world allows us to imagine other ways the world might be. Understanding other people and ourselves lets us imagine new ways of being human. To change our world, our selves, and our society we have to think about what we ought to be like, as well as what we actually are like. This book is about how children develop minds that change the world. Learning takes time. It would be a good idea for me to spend a week exploring all the capabilities of my new computer, as my teenage son would, but with grant deadlines and classes breathing down my neck, I’ll just go on relying on the old routines. Children are the R&D department of the human species - the blue-sky guys, the brainstormers. Adults are production and marketing. High IQ is correlated with later maturing and more plastic frontal lobes. Keeping your mind open longer may be part of what makes you smarter. Our protracted immaturity is possible only because we can rely on the love of the people who take care of us. Counterfactuals about the past, and the characteristically human emotions that go with them, seem to be the price we pay for counterfactuals about the future. Because we are responsible for the future, we can feel guilty about the past; because we can hope, we can also regret. Two- and three-year-olds are extremely good at distinguishing imagination and pretense from reality. One of the most distinctive things about pretend play is the fact that it’s accompanied by giggles. It’s the giggles, the knowing look, the dramatic exaggeration, that signal that this is not to be taken seriously. Children may seem confused because they are such expressive and emotional pretenders. They can have real emotional reactions to entirely imaginary scenarios. It may seem that the child trembling under the covers must believe that there really is a monster in the closet. But this is not because children don’t understand the difference between fiction and fact. They are just more moved by both than grown-ups. Children who better understand minds are more socially skillful than those who do not, but they are also better liars. They’re more sympathetic but they’re better at getting under your skin too. Walter Mischel marshmallows: You might think that children just developed more willpower, and there is some truth to that. But children also got better and better at doing things to their own minds to make them behave differently. The successful children put their hands over their eyes, or hummed, or sang. They did much better when they tried imagining that the marshmallows were merely big puffy clouds and not tempting treats. As adults we use similar strategies all the time to regulate our own actions. Children who had imaginary friends were better at predicting how other people would think, feel, or act. Fiction writers reported experiencing their characters as autonomous agents. Fiction writers seemed to maintain an acquaintance with their old imaginary friends. I’ve learned more about human personality and social life from Jane Austen than from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. An American child learns what American minds are like, and a Japanese child learns what Japanese minds are like, But that learning seems to invite her, to make her mind into an American or Japanese one. Does that discovery make her become somebody who values individuality more than cooperation herself? Imaginary worlds seem just as important and appealing as the real ones. They don’t see any particular reason for preferring to live in the real one. Children are useless on purpose. Because children don’t have to restrict our imaginings to the immediately useful, we can freely construct causal maps and exercise our ability to create counterfactuals. We can compute a wide range of possibilities, not just the two or three that are most likely to pay off. We can consider different ways the world might be, not just the ways the world actually is. Inhibition - the ability to keep yourself from acting impulsively. Children are uninhibited. If your agenda is simply to explore both the actual world and all the possible worlds, this apparent defect may be a great asset. Pretend play is notably uninhibited. Lantern consciousness leads to a very different kind of happiness. We lose our selves by becoming part of the world. “Beginner’s mind,” the mind as it is uncontaminated by expertise.","A good friend highly recommended this as one of his favorite books on baby-hood. I just didn't connect with it, after a few attempts. You may love it."
Hire With Your Head,Lou Adler,0470128356,2,"Most hiring processes are geared around the needs of the average candidate, not the best. For the average candidate, a new job is a tactical move based on short-term criteria. For the best, it’s a strategic move. Top people aren’t going to apply for run-of-the-mill jobs that seem the same as everyone else’s. When anyone on the interviewing team finds a candidate they think is hot, they go into immediate sales mode. They also stop listening and stop evaluating competency in a transparent attempt to excite the hot prospect on the merits of the job. This cheapens the job and drives many top people away. Top people don’t look for jobs based on their skills and experience. They look for jobs based on the challenges and opportunities. Define what people need to do with their skills and experiences. Forget the clever questions. Instead, dig deeply into a person’s major accomplishments to observe trends of growth and patterns of behaviors. Use the (first) interview to collect information, not to make a decision. Hiring great people is the single most important thing you can do to ensure your own success. Use standard search-engine techniques to allow top people to quickly find their open positions. Your openings are prominently featured on the first page of your corporate website. Make it fun and compelling. Track the end-to-end yield of those initially viewing an ad to those actually applying. Don’t differentiate on money, differentiate on opportunity. Recruiting the best is not about selling or charming. It’s about providing big challenges and career opportunities and a little money thrown in. Examine all aspects of your hiring process from the perspective of a top person who has little time to spare and multiple opportunities. Core steps: defining the job, sourcing, interviewing, assessing, and recruiting. Redesign each of these steps from the perspective of a top candidate, and then integrate them into a systematic business process. While each step is relatively easy to solve, fixing all of them and making sure they stay fixed for all candidates is the secret to making the hiring of top talent a systematic business process. A performance profile is what the person taking the job needs to do to be considered successful. Describe the real job, not the person taking the job. For most jobs, it takes from three weeks to three months after a candidate starts to determine true competency. One of the biggest problems is that too much emphasis is placed on the interaction between the candidate and the interviewer, and too little on the candidate’s ability and motivation to do the job. This is the primary cause of hiring mistakes. Interpersonal relationships and biases. This is how randomness enters the hiring process. If you like a candidate, you tend to go into chat mode, ask easier questions, and look for information to confirm your initial impression. If you don’t like someone, you put up a defense shield, ask tougher questions, and try to end the interview quickly. You go out of your way to find information to prove your initial belief that the candidate is incompetent. There is a natural tendency to overemphasize the “getting the job” skills when assessing a candidate, rather than the person’s ability to “do the job.” Remaining objective, overcoming the natural tendency to judge people based on first impressions, personality, and a few select traits. Overcoming this problem will eliminate 50 percent of all common hiring errors. Understanding real job needs will eliminate most of the rest of them. Wait 30 minutes before making any decision about a candidate’s ability to do the work. To increase your objectivity during the interview, use the following six ideas: 1. Measure first impressions at the end of the interview. As 2. Disallow the yeslno decision unless the candidate is a complete dud. Make it a rule that you must suspend any decision for at least 30 minutes. During these 30 minutes, conduct a work-history review and get some details about the candidate’s major accomplishments 3. Delay the decision by redefining the purpose of the interview. Use the interview just to collect information, not to make a decision. 4. Ask the same questions to all candidates. 5. Demand evidence before you accept gut feelings. Facts, examples, and details must be provided to justify a ranking, good or bad. 6. Make a “no” harder to justify than a “yes.” Interviewers need to train candidates to give complete information. If you leave it up to candidates to provide this information on their own, you’re measuring interviewing and presentation skills, not job competency. Write compelling job descriptions that describe real job needs, not ads that emphasize skills and qualifications. It should be so clearly written that your top candidate could show it to his circle of personal advisors and easily convince them this is a true career move. Design every aspect of sourcing to attract top people (whether active or passive), which includes where you place the exciting job descriptions, how you design the career web site, how you get referrals, and when you make phone calls. Organize the interview to assess competency and create opportunity at the same time. You do this by asking tougher questions, not by overselling or overtalking. Top candidates must leave the interview knowing they have been assessed completely and properly. They must leave knowing the job offers a true career opportunity. Making the job hard to earn but worthy of earning is how you hire top people. First define superior performance. Performance is about results, not about skills and qualifications. When Teddy Roosevelt was Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy, he purchased a used Brazilian merchant ship, the Nictheroy for $500,000, under the proviso that it must arrive under its own power within a very short time frame to a specific port. The contract didn’t have any of the normal technical specifications. Roosevelt knew that if the ship couldn’t travel the distance required by the date specified it was worthless. Every job, from entry-level to CEO, has six to eight performance objectives that define job success. These objectives spell out what the person in the job must do to be considered successful, Specific: Include the details of what needs to be done so that others understand it. Measurable: It’s best if the objective is easy to measure by including amounts or percent changes. Action-oriented: Action verbs build, improve, change, and help understanding. Results: A definition that complements the measurable piece by clearly indicating what needs to happen. Time-bound: Include a date or state how long it will take to start and complete. Environment: Describe the company culture, pace, pressure, available resources, and politics. Categories: effectively dealing with people, achieving objectives, organizing teams, solving problems, using technology, and making changes. Creating these performance objectives starts by asking what the person taking the job needs to do to be successful, not what the person needs to have. First, determine the top six to eight performance objectives in general terms, then get more specific. The hiring team needs to put the final performance objectives in priority order. 1. Define the majorobjectives. Determine what a person taking this job needs to do over the next 6 to 12 months to be considered successful. Most jobs have two to three major objectives 2. Develop subobjectives. For each major objective, determine the two or three things a successful person would need to do to achieve the major objective. 3. Ask questions to make sure you have all of the key obfectives. 4. Convert having to doing. 5. Convert technical skills into results. Make the creation of these requirements a primary performance objective. During the first interview, the president and the candidate (who ultimately got the job) spent two hours together developing a detailed operational plan for this new business. Determine what the best performers already in the job do differently from everyone else, then look for these same abilities in the people you hire. Also study the worst people, discover what they do that makes them poor performers, and then avoid these traits. During the first _____ days, identify the key resources needs to accomplish this, evaluate actual status against existing plans, and revise and implement as necessary to achieve the planned goals. One of our key technically oriented objectives is manage the [implementation, launch, design, development of] __________. Over the next _________ months, we must [complete, identify, plan, define resource needs] to ensure achieving planned results. During the first ____ days, prepare a strategic plan outlining all the needs of the department to meet the company’s long-term objective of _________ From this, prepare a calendar-based monthly operating budget and implementation plan by _________ [date]. Your employee base needs to mimic your customer base. Compensation is not the primary consideration. The opportunity and challenges inherent in the job are. Top people want to work for leaders and mentors who can help them reach their goals. Tie the actual job to some major company initiative Great ads must meet three criteria: 1. Have a compelling title 2. Write copy that’s focused on what the candidate will learn, do, and become. 3. Describe the most critical skills in the context of how they’re used. Call the best candidates within 24 hours. If someone applies on your site, you’ll need to make sure your backend search engine automatically brings this person to the top of the list. To be a leader of the company, what qualities do you look for? A: You clearly want somebody who can articulate a vision. They have to have enormous energy and the incredible ability to energize others. If you can’t energize others, you can’t be a leader. —Jack Welch The best had four common characteristics that were observable in the initial interview: (1) self-motivation—everyone who achieved any level of success worked hard; (2) an ability to motivate others—inspiring others to work hard, including peers, superiors, as well as their own team; (3) achievement of results that were comparable to what needed to be achieved; and (4) an ability to solve comparable job problems in real time. The best people consistently deliver more results than expected, and they do it on time, all the time. This separates the best from everyone else. Don’t be seduced by affability and social assertiveness. Another common error is to eliminate quiet people assuming there is a lack of energy. “Of all of the things you’ve accomplished in your career, what stands out as most significant? Now could you go ahead and tell me all about it?” Getting the correct answer to this question can tell you 65 percent to 75 percent of everything you need to make an accurate hiring decision. The correct answer comes by fact-finding and getting complete details of the accomplishment. What were the three or four big challenges you had to overcome? What were the actual results obtained? When did this take place and at what company? How long did it take to complete the task? What was the situation you faced when you took on the project? Why were you chosen for this role? Did you volunteer? Why? What was your actual title? Who were the people on the team? What was your supervisor’s title? What technical skills were needed to accomplish the task? What skills were learned? Describe the planning process, your role in it, and whether the plan was met. Provide details of what went wrong and how you overcame them. What was your actual role in this project? Give me three examples of where you took the initiative. Why? What were the biggest changes or improvements? What was the toughest decision you had to make? How did you make it? Was it the right decision? Would you make it differently if you could? Describe the environment—the pace, the resources available, your boss, and the level of professionalism. What was the biggest conflict you faced? Who was it with and how did you resolve it? Give me some examples of helping or coaching others. Give me some examples of where you really had to influence or persuade others to change their opinion. How did you personally grow or change as a result of this effort? What did you like the most and least? In retrospect, what would you do differently if you could? What type of recognition did you receive for this project? Was it appropriate in your mind? Why or why not? The key to using the most significant accomplishment (MSA) question is to ask it multiple times to observe long-term trends for individual, team, and job-related accomplishments. If you want to better understand a candidate’s thinking, planning, and job-specific problem-solving skills, just ask this question: “If you were to get this job, how would you go about solving _______ [describe a typical problem]?” Don’t accept generalities like “Created a new market,” “Turned the department around,” and “Developed a new procedure.” Don’t hesitate to ask for clarifying information. “Please draw an organization chart and tell me how you built and developed this team, and describe the group’s biggest accomplishment.” Determine whether the candidate’s performance is on an upward trend, has flattened out, or is declining. If you were to get the job what additional information would you need to know, and how would you go about accomplishing this objective?” Eight steps provide a brief outline of the interviewing process: 1: Warm-up; do a quick overview and understand the candidate’s motivation for looking. Use the first 5 to 10 minutes to gain a quick sense of the candidate, overcome temporary nervousness, and find out why the person is looking for a job. 2: Wait 30 minutes and Measure the impact of first impressions at the end of the interview. Use the interview to collect information, not decide competency. Decide competency by carefully evaluating the candidate’s responses against real job needs. It’s best to do this at the end of the interview or during a group deliberation where everyone shares information. 3: Conduct a comprehensive work history review. Go through every job and find out what the person accomplished, what the person didn’t accomplish, the team the person worked with, why the person took the job, and any recognition they received. If you spend half of the opening interview on this, you’ll know what you need to do in the second half. 4: Ask about major individual accomplishments. This is the MSA question. During the work history review, ask about the highlights of major accomplishments, then select ones that best meet your job needs to learn more about. 5: Ask about a major team accomplishment. This is the modification to the MSA question with the focus on team leadership. Spend a great deal of time on this, using specific team fact-finding follow-up questions. 6: Ask a problem-solving question. During this visualization question, start a discussion about a realistic job problem, not some hypothetical situation. 7: Recruit and close. Don’t end the interview on a neutral note, but don’t give the farm away either. Done properly, the close can be a useful way to begin the recruiting process without overselling. 8: Measure first impressions again. Most Significant Accomplishment Question In Chapter 7, you discover how to modify the MSA question. “Give me examples of when your personality has hurt your performance.” Don’t ignore this part. Continue probing. Be concerned if you get a run-around or some vague response. Some Fatal Flaws Great communicator, with lots of self-confidence, but the person’s management role doesn’t seem to be growing. You might have found a great individual contributor or a consultant-type person, but a weak manager. Vague, superficial, or short answers when explaining critical issues, especially gaps in employment and why the person changed jobs, or failed to get the recognition deserved. Inconsistent track record—flat, down, roller coaster—that is always blamed on external circumstances. Lots of drive and ambition, but maybe too assertive. This could relate to ego problems, immaturity, or an inability to work in cross-functional teams. Too fast of a track record. The person might have been promoted beyond his capability. Extremes in any behavior—too analytical, too assertive, too friendly, or too persuasive. Usually this leads to problems regarding lack of flexibility or balance. Lots of energy, great personality, but answers are too general. This is the classic—lots of sizzle, but little substance. Lots of excuses about why things didn’t happen, results weren’t achieved, or why recognition didn’t occur. A pattern of excuse making is the biggest clue that you’re hiring the wrong person. If you observe any of these signs, you must get proof to overcome the potential concern. Conduct the reference check just like the interview by getting specific examples to prove a generality and then by fact-finding. You must conduct a background check on every candidate including degree verification, employment history, credit review, driving record, and criminal background. The cost is low and the protection is high. First, never make an offer until it’s accepted. Second, provide your candidate a compelling future vision that overwhelms the past. 30% PLUS Solution = Job Stretch + Job Growth + $$ Increase + Manager’s Total Involvement You can’t tell a person how great a job is. The person needs to learn it on his own. Challenging questions are another way to create interest by pushing the candidate away to see whether the candidate pushes back. This is how you put candidates in the back seat. For example, “While I like your background, I’m concerned you don’t have enough experience in developing international accounting systems. Have I missed something? If not, can you describe something you’ve accomplished that you feel is most related to our needs?” This slight challenge increases the importance of this skill and requires the candidate to sell the interviewer. This approach, used judiciously throughout the interview, can increase a candidate’s interest in a job. If the concern is valid, it demonstrates areas where the candidate can learn and grow if she were to get the job. Use the following as the last question at the end of the first interview. It’s a must for all strong candidates: “Although we’re seeing some other fine candidates, I’m very impressed with your background. What are your thoughts now about this position?” I told the candidate the salary range (only a slightly higher percentage over his current package) and the next steps in the evaluation process. This consisted of a meeting with two board members on the East Coast, a half-day session with an industrial psychologist in the Midwest, and then a dinner with the chairman. This was before the medical and drug test, and a final meeting with the CEO. The candidate was very interested, but when he agreed to continue this arduous process, I knew the deal was almost done.","Great advice on hiring, but insanely repetitive. Maybe this was an editing mistake - that the exact same points are made over and over and over and over - often with the exact same words, sentences, even paragraphs. But those key points are great."
The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work,Alain De Botton,0307277259,2,"Bring to the study of harbour life a devotion more often witnessed in relation to art, their behaviour implying a belief that creativity and intelligence can be as present in the transport of axles around the tip of the western Sahara as they are in the use of impasto in a female nude. It seems easier to respond to our enthusiasms by trading in facts than by investigating the more naive question of how and why we have been moved. Upon arriving in a new country, were apt to express particular curiosity about its granaries, aqueducts, harbours and workshops, feeling that the observation of work could be as stimulating as anything on a stage or chapel wall. No one wants to open up to writers, who bring in no money and are liable to cause trouble. Even in an era of increased political transparency, businesses remain uninterested in acquiring observers. In the hands of an experienced branding expert, decisions about width, shape, coating, packaging and name can furnish a biscuit with a personality as subtly and appropriately nuanced as that of a protagonist in a great novel. When does a job feel meaningful? Whenever it allows us to generate delight or reduce suffering in others. The adults who feature in children’s books are rarely, if ever, Regional Sales Managers or Building Services Engineers. They are shopkeepers, builders, cooks or farmers – people whose labour can easily be linked to the visible betterment of human life. In our society the greatest sums of money so often tended to accrue from the sale of the least meaningful things. Envy: Symons was a particular admirer of this feeling, and lamented the way that its useful role in alerting us to our possibilities was too often censored out of priggish moralism. Without envy, there could be no recognition of one’s desires. List everyone you most regularly envy. Resigned to spending their entire adult lives working at jobs chosen for them by their unthinking sixteen-year-old selves. One might squander one’s life chances because of a high-handed disdain for books with titles such as The Will to Succeed, believing that one was above their shrill slogans of encouragement. One might be doomed not by a lack of talent, but by a species of pessimistic pride. The weight accorded to ideas of nurture and to the development of self-esteem in theories of modern education no longer seemed like a sign that our societies had gone mad or soft. On the contrary, this emphasis was as finely attuned to the demands of contemporary working life as instruction in stoicism and physical bravery had been to the exigencies of ancient times. It owed its existence less to kindness than to practical necessity. Like the rearing methods of every age, it was intended to ensure that the young would be granted the optimal chances of survival in a hostile environment. Most of us stand poised at the edge of brilliance, haunted by the knowledge of our proximity, yet still demonstrably on the wrong side of the line, our dealings with reality undermined by a range of minor yet critical psychological flaws (a little too much optimism, an unprocessed rebelliousness, a fatal impatience or sentimentality). We are like an exquisite high-speed aircraft which for lack of a tiny part is left stranded beside the runway, rendered slower than a tractor or a bicycle. Our individual misfortunes, instead of seeming to us quasi-inevitable aspects of life, will weigh down on us like particular curses. In denying the natural place reserved for longing and error in the human lot, the bourgeois ideology denies us the possibility of collective consolation for our fractious marriages and our unexploited ambitions, and condemns us instead to solitary feelings of shame and persecution for having stubbornly failed to become who we are. Nature, meanwhile, had become an object of concern and pity, like a former foe arrived at one’s gates, bleeding to death. No longer standing as a symbol of all which surpassed us, the natural landscape instead everywhere bore the scars of our quixotic powers. We could look up at the diminishing snows of Kilimanjaro and reflect on the ill effects of our turbines. We could fly over denuded stretches of the Amazon and perceive the rain forest to be no more robust than a single flower in our hands. We had learnt to feel respect for circuit boards and pity and guilt towards glaciers. Works which ordinary gallery visitors might regard as inert entertainment are, for artists, living prescriptions. We might define art as anything which pushes our thoughts in important yet neglected directions. The great works of art have about them the quality of a reminder. Wishing that the rest of mankind would follow the engineers’ example and agree on a series of symbols which could point incontrovertibly to certain elusive, vaporous and often painful psychological states- a code which might help us to feel less tongue-tied and less lonely, and enable us to resolve arguments with swift and silent exchanges of equations. There seemed to be no shortage of feelings to which the engineers’ brevity might be profitably applied. If only a letter could have been identified, for example, with which elegantly to allude to the strange desire one occasionally has to elicit love from people one does not even particularly like (β, say); or the irritation evoked when acquaintances seem to be more worried about one’s illnesses than one is oneself. United by their belief that the manner in which the world was presently organised was in no way representative of its full potential. His varied activities had furnished him with an unusually keen sense of how things worked, freeing him of the naive and childish perspective from which most of us still see the world. He regarded the large artefacts of finance and industry which surround us, and which we often assume to be as inevitable as the earth’s natural features – our warehouses, shopping centres, control towers, banks and holidays resorts – not as the products of remote or obscure processes, but of efforts by people a little like himself, plucky and hard-working types who felt that destiny was theirs to mould. He knew how things fitted together: he knew how to finance a supermarket and go about building a fifty-two-storey skyscraper. He knew which city lawyer could help him to acquire an oil platform and how to negotiate with the government of Australia to buy up private schools in New South Wales. He could look out across any landscape and be confident that it was not the gods who had made it, but people a little like himself. These energetic men and women were undermined by their obvious misunderstanding of how people actually went about making decisions on such matters as how to cross a lake or eat crisps, how to store products in the bathroom or put out a fire. These individuals were writing their stories in a subgenre of contemporary fiction, the business plan, and populating them with characters endowed with deeply implausible personalities. The ideal entrepreneur: In character a judicious fusion of the utopian and the practical, he or she would succeed not only in identifying an important need but also in mastering the challenges of bureaucracy and finance in order to give the resolution of that need an institutional form, and thereby affect others’ lives in ways that theory alone could never do. These enterprising types had not – like me – fled back into their own dreams at the first mention of a sales tax or an employee ledger; they had instead managed to survive the challenges of finance, law and recruitment and, as a result, they had been able to give their flights of fancy a lucrative and consequential dimension. These paragons bore much the same relation to the mere intellectual as a restaurant-owning chef might to a writer of cookery books.","Thoughtful rambling observations on different lines of work. Personal tales of his time spent observing different industries like fishing, counseling, shipyards, or walking along electric towers. Some tangential insights along the way."
Born Standing Up,Steve Martin,1416553657,2,"There is no harm in charging oneself up with delusions between moments of valid inspiration. Any new social philosophy is good for creativity. Philosophy of dressing for the stage: “Always look better than they do.” It was easy to be great. Every entertainer has a night when everything is clicking. These nights are accidental and statistical: Like lucky cards in poker, you can count on them occurring over time. What was hard was to be good, consistently good, night after night, no matter what the abominable circumstances. Performing in so many varied situations made every predicament manageable, What my last year of stand-up was about: I had become a party host, presiding not over timing and ideas but over a celebratory bash of my own making. Moving on and not looking back, not living in the past, was a way to trick myself into further creativity.","A simple autobiography of his early years. Interesting tale, though no usable lessons for me."
Committed,Elizabeth Gilbert,115352490,2,"When you are pushed by circumstance to do the one thing you have always most specifically loathed and feared, this can be, at the very least, an interesting growth opportunity. The more I learned about something, the less it frightened me. Some fears can be vanquished, Rumpelstiltskin-like, only by uncovering their hidden, secret names. Where I come from, the person whom you choose to marry is perhaps the single most vivid representation of your own personality. Your spouse becomes the most gleaming possible mirror through which your emotional individualism is reflected back to the world. There is no choice more intensely personal, after all, than whom you choose to marry; that choice tells us, to a large extent, who you are. The emotional place where a marriage begins is not nearly as important as the emotional place where a marriage finds itself. Plant an expectation; reap a disappointment. In German, zwei means “two,” and zweifel means “doubt” - suggesting that two of anything brings the automatic possibility of uncertainty to our lives. She had dared to ask for happiness, and she had dared to expect that happiness out of her marriage. You can’t possibly ask for more than that. Marriage becomes hard work once you have poured the entirety of your life’s expectations for happiness into the hands of one mere person. Keeping that going is hard work. An “autonomistic marriage.” They created their own wedding vows, speaking during the ceremony about the absolute privacy of their union, and swearing that Edwin would not dominate his wife in any way, nor would she take his name. Moreover, Lillian refused to swear eternal loyalty to Edwin, but stated firmly that she would “make no promises that it may become impossible or immoral for me to fulfill, but retain the right to act always as my conscience and best judgment shall dictate.” This is the singular fantasy of human intimacy: that one plus one will somehow, someday, equal one. Research has also shown that people are far more susceptible to infatuation when they are going through delicate or vulnerable times in their lives. The more unsettled and unbalanced we feel, the more quickly and recklessly we are likely fall in love. When you become infatuated with somebody, you’re not really looking at that person; you’re just captivated by your own reflection, intoxicated by a dream of completion that you have projected on a virtual stranger. Any actual relating is impossible during such a state of pitched fever. Real, sane, mature love - the kind that pays the mortgage year after year and picks up the kids after school - is not based on infatuation but on affection and respect. And the word “respect,” from the Latin respicere (“to gaze at”), suggests that you can actually see the person who is standing next to you, something you absolutely cannot do from within the swirling mists of romantic delusion. Reality exits the stage the moment that infatuation enters. I refuse to burden Felipe with the tremendous responsibility of somehow completing me. (Cheating:) What often happens, though, during so-called harmless friendships, is that you begin sharing intimacies with your new friend that belong hidden within your marriage. You reveal secrets about yourself - your deepest yearnings and frustrations - and it feels good to be so exposed. You throw open a window where there really ought to be a solid, weight-bearing wall, and soon you find yourself spilling your secret heart with this new person. Not wanting your spouse to feel jealous, you keep the details of your new friendship hidden. In so doing, you have now created a problem: You have just built a wall between you and your spouse where there really ought to be free circulation of air and light. Her suggestion would be that you come home and tell your husband or wife about it. The script goes along these lines: “I have something worrying to share with you. I went out to lunch twice this week with Mark, and I was struck by the fact that our conversation quickly became intimate. I found myself sharing things with him that I used to share only with you. This is the way you and I used to talk at the beginning of our relationship - and I loved that so much - but I fear we’ve lost that. I miss that level of intimacy with you. Do you think there’s anything you and I might do to rekindle our connection?” Prenup: It’s better to set your own terms than to risk the possibility that someday down the road unsentimental strangers in a harsh courtroom might set the terms for you. Mutual meekness can make for a successful partnering strategy, if it’s what both people want. Conflict-averse couples prefer to let their grievances dissolve rather than fight over every point. From a spiritual standpoint, this idea appeals to me immensely. The Buddha taught that most problems - if only you give them enough time and space - will eventually wear themselves out. I love him and therefore I want to protect him - even from me, if that makes sense. I didn’t want to skip any steps of preparation for marriage, or leave anything unresolved that might reemerge later to harm us - to harm him. I presented to him a list of my very worst character flaws, just so I would be certain he had been fairly warned. People always fall in love with the most perfect aspects of each other’s personalities. Who wouldn’t? Anybody can love the most wonderful parts of another person. But that’s not the clever trick. The really clever trick is this: Can you accept the flaws? Maybe all our marriages must be linked to each other somehow, woven on a larger social loom, in order to endure. Married men live longer than single men; married men accumulate more wealth than single men; married men excel at their careers above single men; married men are far less likely to die a violent death than single men; married men report themselves to be much happier than single men; and married men suffer less from alcoholism, drug addiction, and depression than do single men. A woman who has managed to keep her vibrant career thriving even with three kids, and who sometimes takes her children with her on overseas business trips, said, “Just go for it. It’s not that hard. You just have to push against all the forces that tell you what you can’t do anymore now that you’re a mom.” The percentage of women who never reproduce in most societies is usually much higher than 10 percent - and that’s not just today in the developed Western world, where childless rates among women tend to hover around 50 percent. In the 1920s in America, for instance, a whopping 23 percent of adult women never had any children. The number can get pretty high. But it never goes below 10 percent. “sparents” = spare parents. On hand wherever help is needed, in anybody’s family whatsoever. There are people I’ve been able to help, sometimes fully supporting them for years, because I am not obliged, as a mother would be obliged, to put all my energies and resources into the full-time rearing of a child. There are a whole bunch of Little League uniforms and orthodontist’s bills and college educations that I will never have to pay for, thereby freeing up resources to spread more widely across the community. In this way, I, too, foster life. There are many, many ways to foster life. “Wifeless Marriage” - which is to say that nobody in our household will exclusively play the traditional role of the wife. It's a luxuriously innocent fantasy: that one is entitled to have unmixed feelings about one’s own life. “flooding” - the point at which you get so tired or frustrated that your mind becomes deluged (and deluded) by anger. A surefire indication that flooding is imminent is when you start using the words “always” or “never” in your argument. They claim they can predict with 90% accuracy whether a couple will still be married in five years merely by studying a fifteen-minute transcript of typical conversation between the husband and the wife. (For this reason, I imagine that John M. Gottman and Julie Schwartz-Gottman make terrifying dinner guests.) You can measure the happiness of a marriage by the number of scars that each partner carries on their tongues, earned from years of biting back angry words. “Let’s just be careful of what we say to each other for the next few hours,” he said. “These are the times, when people get tired like this, that fights can happen. Let’s just choose our words very carefully until we find a place to rest.” Nothing had happened yet, but Felipe was floating the idea that there are, perhaps, moments when a couple must practice preemptive conflict resolution, arresting an argument before it can even begin. So this had become a code phrase of ours, a signpost to mind the gap and beware of falling rocks. He can create a familiar habitat of reassuringly boring everyday practices for himself anyplace, if you just let him stay in one spot. He can assimilate absolutely anywhere on the planet in the space of about three days, and then he’s capable of staying put in that place for the next decade or so without complaint. I have one of the most easygoing relationships you could possibly imagine, but please do not be fooled: I have utterly claimed this man as my own, and I have therefore fenced him off from the rest of the herd. His energies (sexual, emotional, creative) belong in large part to me, not to anybody else - not even entirely to himself anymore. He owes me things like information, explanations, fidelity, constancy, and details about the most mundane little aspects of his life. (Walking in India with beggars everywhere:) I felt poisoned by the constant repetition of the word “NO” coming out of my own mouth again and again: an awful incantation. Wedding is not just to ‘satisfy’ other people. Rather, you have to hold your wedding guests to their end of the deal. They have to help you with your marriage; they have to support you, if one of you falters. “I’m Brazilian.” “But what does that even mean?” Felipe laughed. “Nobody knows! That’s the wonderful thing about being Brazilian. It doesn’t mean anything! So you can use your Brazilianness as an excuse to live your life any way you want. It’s a brilliant strategy, actually. It’s taken me far.” “So how does that help me?” “Perhaps it can help you to relax! You’re about to marry a Brazilian. Why don’t you start thinking like a Brazilian?” “How?” “By choosing what you want! That’s the Brazilian way, isn’t it? We borrow everyone’s ideas, mix it all up, and then we create something new out of it.” No matter how modern and sophisticated Felipe and I might feel, I feared we would step onto the assembly line of marriage and soon enough find ourselves molded into spouses - crammed into some deeply conventional shape that benefited society, even if it did not entirely benefit us. Every couple in the world has the potential over time to become a small and isolated nation of two - creating their own culture, their own language, and their own moral code, to which nobody else can be privy. TRAVEL TIPS: The budget oasis of the Atlanta Hotel in Bangkok. The Atlanta is a wonder that must be seen to be believed, and even then it cannot really be believed. http://www.theatlantahotelbangkok.com/ The Hmong have never really belonged to any of the countries in which they live. They remain some of the world’s most spectacularly independent people - nomads, storytellers, warriors, natural-born anticonformists, and a terrible bane to any nation that has ever tried to control them. Luang Prabang is an exquisite place that has somehow managed over the centuries to wedge forty Buddhist temples onto one small slice of real estate.","If listening to someone think out loud about marriage for 12 hours interests you, you will like this.

What the Dog Saw,Malcolm Gladwell,0316075841,2,"You don’t start at the top if you want to find the story. You start in the middle, because it’s the people in the middle who do the actual work in the world. People at the top are self-conscious about what they say (and rightfully so) because they have position and privilege to protect — and self-consciousness is the enemy of “interestingness.” What we think isn’t the issue. Instead, I’m more interested in describing what people who think about homelessness or ketchup or financial scandals think about homelessness or ketchup or financial scandals. Curiosity about the interior life of other people’s day-to-day work is one of the most fundamental of human impulses. It was a mistake to separate product development from marketing, as most of their contemporaries did, because to them the two were indistinguishable: the object that sold best was the one that sold itself. If, out of a crowd of fifty, twenty-five people come forward to buy, the true pitchman sells to only twenty of them. To the remaining five, he says, “Wait! There’s something else I want to show you!” Then he starts his pitch again, with slight variations, and the remaining four or five become the inner core of the next crowd, hemmed in by the people around them, and so eager to pay their money and be on their way that they start the selling frenzy all over again. The turn requires the management of expectation. That’s why Arnold always kept a pineapple tantalizingly perched on his stand. “For forty years, I’ve been promising to show people how to cut the pineapple, and I’ve never cut it once.” “I know how to ask for the money. And that’s the secret to the whole damn business.” You have to explain the invention to customers — not once or twice but three or four times, with a different twist each time. You have to show them exactly how it works and why it works. Finally, sell them on the paradoxical fact that, revolutionary as the gadget is, it’s not at all hard to use. If Ron had been the one to introduce the VCR, in other words, he would not simply have sold it in an infomercial. He would also have changed the VCR itself, so that it made sense in an infomercial. The clock, for example, wouldn’t be digital. (The haplessly blinking unset clock has, of course, become a symbol of frustration.) The tape wouldn’t be inserted behind a hidden door — it would be out in plain view, just like the chicken in the rotisserie, so that if it was recording you could see the spools turn. The controls wouldn’t be discreet buttons; they would be large, and they would make a reassuring click as they were pushed up and down, and each step of the taping process would be identified with a big, obvious numeral so that you could set it and forget it. And would it be a slender black, low-profile box? Of course not. Ours is a culture in which the term “black box” is synonymous with incomprehensibility. Ron’s VCR would be in red-and-white plastic, both opaque and translucent swirl, or maybe 364 Alcoa aluminum, painted in some bold primary color, and it would sit on top of the television, not below it, so that when your neighbor or your friend came over he would spot it immediately and say, “Wow, you have one of those Ronco Tape-O-Matics!” Nor does he ever bet on the market moving in one direction or another. That would require Taleb to assume that he understands the market, and he doesn’t. Taleb doesn’t even invest in stocks, not for Empirica and not for his own personal account. Buying a stock, unlike buying an option, is a gamble that the future will represent an improved version of the past. And who knows whether that will be true? So all of Taleb’s personal wealth, and the hundreds of millions that Empirica has in reserve, is in Treasury bills. Taleb buys options because he is certain that, at root, he knows nothing, or, more precisely, that other people believe they know more than they do. Karl Popper, who said that you could not know with any certainty that a proposition was true; you could only know that it was not true. He sat down at his kitchen table at 7:30 a.m. He made a plan. Every day, he would write until lunchtime. Then he would lie down on the floor for twenty minutes to rest his mind. Then he would return to work for a few more hours. He was a lawyer. He had discipline. “I figured out very early on that if I didn’t get my writing done I felt terrible. So I always got my writing done. I treated it like a job. I did not procrastinate.” Late bloomers, Galenson says, tend to work the other way around. Their approach is experimental. “Their goals are imprecise, so their procedure is tentative and incremental,” Galenson writes in “Old Masters and Young Geniuses.” Feedback — a direct, personal response by a teacher to a specific statement by a student — seems to be most closely linked to academic success. Not only did the teacher catch the “Me!” amid the wiggling and tumult; she addressed it directly. “Mind you, that’s not great feedback,” Hamre said. “High-quality feedback is where there is a back-and-forth exchange to get a deeper understanding.” The implications are even more profound. They suggest that we shouldn’t be raising standards. We should be lowering them, because there is no point in raising standards if standards don’t track with what we care about. Teaching should be open to anyone with a pulse and a college degree — and teachers should be judged after they have started their jobs, not before. That means that the profession needs to start the equivalent of Ed Deutschlander’s training camp. It needs an apprenticeship system that allows candidates to be rigorously evaluated. Kane and Staiger have calculated that, given the enormous differences between the top and the bottom of the profession, you’d probably have to try out four candidates to find one good teacher. That means tenure can’t be routinely awarded, the way it is now. Currently, the salary structure of the teaching profession is highly rigid, and that would also have to change in a world where we want to rate teachers on their actual performance. An apprentice should get apprentice wages. But if we find eighty-fifth-percentile teachers who can teach a year and a half’s material in one year, we’re going to have to pay them a lot — both because we want them to stay and because the only way to get people to try out for what will suddenly be a high-risk profession is to offer those who survive the winnowing a healthy reward.","A pretty-good collection of his articles from the past few years. While most are somewhat interesting, it felt a little like surfing the net or TV. Lots of “huh”, but no lasting insights. More entertainment than education."
China Road,Rob Gifford,0812975243,2,"In 1989, the Communist Party leaders made an unwritten, unspoken deal with the people of China: stay out of politics, and you can do anything you want. If in the United States you need money to get power, in China you need power to get money. There is nothing anymore in China that defines orthodoxy, in morality or anything else, so people just do what they want. The Dao in Daoism, the Way itself, is by its nature unknowable. The first line of the classic Daoist text, the Dao De Jing, lays this out very clearly: “The way that can be walked is not the True Way, the name that can be named is not the True Name.” I always feel this single line has had more impact on the Chinese psyche than almost any other. There is no absolute spiritual truth. Truth, if it even exists, is unknowable. To write on a computer in Chinese, you must write the character’s transliteration in the Western alphabet (qiu, xia, zhao, meng, or whatever—all of which have multiple characters that make the same sound), hit Return, and a choice of the characters romanized that way comes up. You then choose the one you want. Brilliant book, China Shakes the World, by the former Beijing correspondent of the Financial Times James Kynge. In the West, our better future is supposedly already here, so life is no longer as much of a journey. We have (so we think) reached our destination, so we’ve sat down, put our feet up, and poured ourselves a large drink. In France, workers are restricted by law to a thirty-five-hour workweek. Many Chinese people work that in two days.","Not a business book, unless you want to understand China a bit more.

Hot Commodities,Jim Rogers,0812973712,2,"Almost every time I've made serious money, it's been by heading in the opposite direction of the crowd. I am the world's worst trader. Over decades, I've learned that the best way for me to make money is to find something cheap that I like, take a position, and hold it for the long term. I'm a lousy trader and I avoid short-term investments. Search for opportunities in one or two sectors, then focus on a specific commodity or two that intrigue you. Say copper catches your eye, the overriding question is: #1 : Will the price go higher? This might require serious homework. CRB Commodity Yearbook. Brief summary of inventories and demands in recent years. But you need to look deeper than that. #2 : What to look for? Supply and demand. Always better to invest in the commodity itself, not the companies around it. Saves a lot of effort and reduces a lot of mistakes. Also on average will get 300% the return over the companies! I would not advise anyone to buy a house in New York, Boston, or London. Not only have those cities been subject to overpriced real estate for years, but their economies are much too dependent on financial services, a market sector that has not done well in previous commodity bull markets. If you want to speculate in real estate, buy a house at the lake in a farm state (Iowa or Nebraska), or in an oil and natural-gas area (Oklahoma) or a mining state (Montana or Colorado), where communities will benefit from the rising prices in metals, energy, and agricultural products. If you had bought property several years ago in commodity-rich countries as Canada, New Zealand, Australia or Chile, you would have increased your equity severalfold. I don't like to sell something short, unless it's *unbelievably* expensive. (And I mean unbelievably.

""Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures"" - article by Yale School of Management's Center for International Finance - is a truly revolutionary document. Gary Gorton and Geert Rouwenhorst. Since 1959, commodities futures have produced better annual returns than stocks and outperformed bonds even more. Commodities have had less risk than stocks and bonds, as well as better returns. During the 1970s, commodities futures outperformed stocks. During the 1980s, the exact opposite was true, showing the negative correlation between stocks and commodities.

Poking a Dead Frog,Mike Sacks,9780143123781,1,"Avoid anything you feel is a cheap laugh based on shock or just being dirty. You can always get a laugh, but you don’t want it to come at the price of your dignity. Writers tend to write ordinary people in weird situations. Performers tend to write weird people in ordinary situations. Writers are obsessed, with originality. We must always move forward, never backward. So that once something has been done, it should perhaps be built upon, but never, ever repeated. For performers, the fact that something has been done before isn't a problem. People get extremely angry when you create comedy that isn’t funny. Make everything as personal and specific as you can. It works when screenwriters make their writing too specific to their own lives. The specificity makes it brilliant. “Midnight Run” : the tightest screenplay ever written - not one wasted word - and a dozen indelible characters with strong personalities, each with specific goals and realistic motivations. Sadly, the world - and you might not know this - is imperfect. (I like the comic placement of the middle phrase.) The best ending for a story is at once inevitable and surprising. That it was the only way it could’ve happened, and yet the audience didn’t see it coming. Anything I’ve ever written that I felt was really great, I inevitably will look at two years later and think, Oh, God, this is so amateurish and terrible. But that’s a good thing. Your attitude has to constantly be, “Who is this rank amateur, and how can I teach him how to write?” The teacher would write a phrase from a Shakespeare play on the board. We had two minutes to think, eight minutes to compose, two minutes to correct, and then we put our pencils down: 2-8-2. That is how you train writers. When writers have all the time in the world, we don’t do shit. I want to write a joke so good that it somehow rights the rest of my life. That’s the nice thing about having demons. It makes you very productive. Working aloud, talking out every line, kept the show from sounding overly written. When you write alone, and have all the time in the world, you end up rewording sentences, editing and re-editing clauses, playing around with syntax - and your jokes tend to stiffen up as a result. They sound labored over — unnatural. At The Onion, the goal was to never have something sound like a joke. Comedy was delivered as fact. Because of that, we squeeze jokes into introductory clauses. We mix setups and punch lines together: a really dry and understated approach. The timing is different when something is performed versus when it’s read silently on a page. In front of a live audience - you want laughs. I love comedy that’s a slow burn, where it takes a couple of seconds to connect all the different bits of information in a joke before it lands. Mix emotions. I like comedy that has moments of heart in it, or sadness, or fear. I like comedy that makes people feel different things while they’re laughing. Nothing sharpens your writing faster than the desperate desire for validation. Having your self-worth inextricably linked to your work may be unhealthy, but it’s also responsible for most of my success. Rewriting is everything. Keep rewriting until you get what you want, and then write some more. You never finish anything, you just abandon it. When you say, “I can’t do better,” you stop.","I thought it was going to be about the craft of comedy, but it was mostly about the business: TV staff writers talking shop."
And Never Stop Dancing,Gordon Livingston,0738212490,1,"Many of the rules we follow were constructed to protect the interests and privileges of someone other than us. With the notable exception of those we pay to entertain us, most people tend to underestimate their strengths. Passion between a romantic couple is finite. If it lasts a thousand days, count yourself among the lucky. There is no loneliness like marriage. After listening to someone go on and on about what a terrible person his or her spouse turned out to be, I often say something like, “I guess he changed as a person in a way you would never have predicted.” The response is usually, “Yes, that’s exactly what happened.” Then I say, “OK, that’s called a mistake. One of the rules of life is that, in general, we have to pay for our mistakes. What you’re feeling at the moment is your payment.” How can we know whether we have the ability to love another adult as much as we love ourselves? The best indications are how we behave in their presence. How does this other person make us feel about ourselves? Are we at our best when we are with them? A good marriage is easy provided that both people have been astute in the selection process. If we choose a partner with ample reserves of kindness and a willingness to place us at the center of his or her life, and if we have sufficiently cultivated those virtues in ourselves, we can refute the “hard work” school of marriage and partake of the endless pleasures of renewable love. Don't vent your frustrations. Don't even complain. Anger begets anger. Kindness begets kindness. Most people grew up in homes in which they were socialized by their parents through the use of “discipline” and criticism. This sort of upbringing suggests that, left to their own devices, children are agents of disorder and defiance. These are the assumptions that promote criticism and anger as the normal way to relate to those closest to us. The challenge for all of us is to mobilize our own considerable capacity for change, to refine our judgments about what we want and how to get it, and not to imagine that the instructions or conclusions of someone else will rescue us. Life is not a rehearsal. Our time, while uncertain, is finite. People at every age are dying every day, most with a lot of unfinished business. “You seem hesitant about doing things differently; do you consider yourself fragile?” Children growing up in families in which one or both parents exhibit a high level of apprehension are often vulnerable themselves to unreasonable fears. Just beneath the surface of an apparent phobia lies an exaggerated sense of the world as a dangerous place. Each year the police in my town offer to X-ray treats handed out on Halloween, looking (vainly so far) for that elusive razor blade in the apple. What messages are we giving our kids about how to live comfortably in the world? The best stepparenting strategy is to leave the discipline to the child’s parent. The good stepparent is able to give the child something unique: a friendly, nonjudgmental adult perspective on the world. Life in general and good relationships with other human beings in particular don’t have to be difficult. In fact, if they are, maybe you need to reevaluate your approach. The entire self-help industry depends on a “Life is hard” worldview. The first thing I wonder when meeting a new patient is, “What is this person’s readiness for change?” The paradox of sleep: You can’t have it until it’s not important to you. Deemphasize the importance of sleep. The importance of a solid eight hours of sleep a night is a myth. Most people can function well on a lot less, and our bodies can be trusted to make up sleep deficits before we collapse from fatigue. Pessimists turn out to be right in the long runj Every snowflake in an avalanche pleads not guilty. Most people die with their music still inside them.","His other book, “Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart” was brilliant. Read that one. This is the weak sequel. Skip this one."
Writing Tools,Roy Peter Clark,0316014990,1,"Begin sentences with subjects and verbs. Make meaning early. Place emphatic words in a sentence at the end. The 2-3-1 tool of emphasis: the most emphatic words or images go at the end, the next most emphatic at the beginning, and the least emphatic in the middle. The difference between a good adverb and a bad adverb? Compare “She smiled happily” and “She smiled sadly.” “Sadly” is good because it changes the meaning. It took several years and hundreds of readings before I noticed I had written “create” and “creating” in the same sentence. It was easy enough to cut “creating,” giving the stronger verb form its own space. Word territory. The power of the written word is to make you hear, to make you feel, to make you see. In his book 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing, Gary Provost created this tour de force to demonstrate what happens when the writer experiments with sentences of different lengths: This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals - sounds that say listen to this, it is important. The purpose of paragraphing is to give the reader a rest. The writer is saying: ‘Have you got that? If so, I’ll go on to the next point.’ Paragraphing is also a matter of the eye. A reader will address himself more readily to his task if he sees from the start that he will have breathing-spaces from time to time than if what is before him looks like a marathon course. If a writer wants the reader to think something is the absolute truth, the writer should render it in the shortest possible sentence. Trust me. In the anti-math of writing, the number three is greater than four. The mojo of three offers a greater sense of completeness than four or more. Use one for power. Use two for comparison, contrast. Use three for completeness, wholeness, roundness. Use four or more to list, inventory, compile, and expand. When the topic is most serious, understate; when least serious, exaggerate. Understatement = “Pay no attention to the writer behind the curtain. Look only at the world.” Hyperbole = “Watch me dance. Aren’t I a clever fellow?” Elmore Leonard: “If it sounds like writing, rewrite it.” Readers read for two reasons: information and experience. There’s the difference. Reports convey information. Stories create experience. Reports transfer knowledge. Stories transport the reader, crossing boundaries of time, space, and imagination. The report points us there. The story puts us there. The famous “Five Ws and H”: Watch what happens when we unfreeze them, when information is transformed into narrative: Who becomes Character. What becomes Action. (What happened.) Where becomes Setting. When becomes Chronology. Why becomes Cause or Motive. How becomes Process. (How it happened.) Elmore Leonard: “Leave out the part that readers tend to skip.” But which part is that? “Thick paragraphs of prose you can see have too many words in them. The writer has gone into the character’s head. BUT: I’ll bet you don’t skip dialogue.” Human speech, captured as dialogue on the page, attracts the eyes of the reader and, if done well, advances the story. Foreshadow conclusions. Plant important clues early. Learn how to craft the cliffhanger. “And there stood one of the oddest human beings I’d ever laid eyes on.” The simple need to learn what he looks like drove me to the next chapter. Build your work around a key question.","Otherwise a good book about writing technique, but unfortunately I found myself wincing at the author's writing style! It strongly violated my favorite Elmore Leonard suggestion: “If it sounds like writing, rewrite it.” Read “On Writing Well” instead."
The Future of Almost Everything,Patrick Dixon,1781254974,1,"The most shocking predictions are usually wrong. So we need to pay close attention to what is most likely and plan for the unexpected. Markets are driven by investor mood. Wars are triggered by anger. Leadership is based on trust. Uptake of new technologies is linked to customer engagement and pleasure. Regulations are driven by activism. Elections are won by conviction. Team performance is driven by motivation. Relationships are formed by human needs, passions and desires. Emotional reactions are usually far more significant than events themselves. Most short-term debates about the future are NOT about what is going to happen, which is often fairly obvious, but about when. Every trend tends to have its counterpart. “News is what someone else does not want you to print. All the rest is advertising.” We will see a new breed of hyper-mobile globalised individuals with no national loyalty or identity and no commitment to any geographical area, yet with friends in every city. These industrialised techno-gypsies consider themselves global citizens. They will be hard to tax and hard to count in census surveys, as well as hard to police. Moving a container 150km by lorry from Birmingham to Southampton costs the same as moving the same container 10,000km by sea from Southampton to Beijing. It is cheaper to transport melons from Istanbul to Naples than to drive melons from a village up in the Italian mountains, to the same market. This overwhelmingly huge difference in freight costs will be one of the single greatest drivers of future global trade, despite increases in energy prices. Areas with major container ports will on average grow up to 40% faster over the next three decades than cities, regions or nations that are landlocked. Videos are great for information but useless at transformation.","On the plus-side, he's focused on future predictions that are most likely to happen. On the down-side, that means there are no big surprises. An interesting read, but not much I needed to take notes on."
"Me, Inc.",Gene Simmons,13215115,1,"Spend as little as you can, and spend only for those things you can’t live without, in order to have money left over. A lesson that would save me, time and time again: Spread the risk. Play to win. In life and in business, it’s always important to recognize what the predominant pattern is. Intrinsically, everything is a business. Everything has, or should have, a balance sheet. Everything has, or should have, a budget. Everything has, or should try to have, a profit motive. Jump in the deep end, and start swimming. It’s the way I’ve always lived. It doesn’t matter the task - if you’re not qualified, you can become qualified. If you have never done it before, you can do it a first time. My first speaking engagement was offered. They made an offer, I countered, and we settled on $100,000. Since then, that’s been my minimum speaking fee. Professionals can’t always help you where you want to go. Don’t buy a home until you have amassed four times the value of the home in your net worth. If you don’t live in a big city, move to one now. Period. Move to where the big dogs play. You will substantially increase your chances of climbing the ladder of success in a big city. Whether this is a good or bad thing is not the point. The point is that, whatever system you are a part of (be it fair or unfair), there are ways to get ahead in it. I decided long ago that I would adapt as best I could, and that I would conform, to the extent that I could, to the inferred rules. “I went into the business for the money, and the art grew out of it.” - Charlie Chaplin Don’t give your kids spending money. Give them a sense of pride by letting them create and run their own little business, hopefully making a profit. Let them become kid entrepreneurs. It’s better to be an octopus than a fish. If an octopus loses a tentacle to a predator, the octopus will survive with seven tentacles left to fend for itself, and perhaps a few lessons learned that will enable it to avoid another such attack. If a fish loses a fin - or worse, its tail - it’s unlikely to fare as well and its survival will be questionable. So use the Octopus Business Model. Create non-cross-collateralized sections and/or businesses - which means that the cost of running a section of your business, and the potential profit of that business, should be self-contained, and not “cross over” to the other businesses. A car comes with five wheels. You’ll get a flat tire at some point. But as long as you’ve got a spare tire in the trunk, you can keep going. In other words, you need to have a backup plan. Always. The next venture, and the next, and the next, you must attack with the very same ferocity, the very same enthusiasm, and the very same delusional faith in yourself as you had when you began your very first. Never slow down, even for a moment. It only takes one success to make all the failures worthwhile. Know when to double down. The key to ascending to the highest heights of success is to know when to increase your efforts toward an already successful enterprise.",I shouldn't have read this.

Bird by Bird,Anne Lamott,0385480016,1,"Writing motivates you to look closely at life. Do it every day. Do it as you would do scales on the piano. Do it by prearrangement with yourself. Do it as a debt of honor. And make a commitment to finishing things. Take people out of themselves and then back to themselves. Good writing is about telling the truth. Anyone who survived childhood has enough material to write for life. Sit down at approximately the same time every day. This is how you train your unconscious to kick in for you creatively. All I have to do is to write down as much as I can see through a one-inch picture frame. Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way. A person’s faults are largely what make him or her likable. They shouldn’t be too perfect; perfect means shallow and unreal and fatally uninteresting. I like for them to have a nice sick sense of humor.

The architecture of databases requires the programmer to pick the categories that matter, and at the granularity that matters In a hostile, depersonalized net environment, identity is one’s liability. What were the kids’ weapons against me? My name, my address, my home. What does putting a picture of someone’s house online really imply, after all? We know where you live. We can get you, the real you—while you have no idea who we are. the anonymous status of people in an online group engenders crowd behavior. They have nothing to fear as individuals, and get used to taking actions from a distance and from secrecy. As a result, they exacerbate digital technology’s most dehumanizing tendencies, and end up behaving angrily, destructively, and automatically. They go from being people to being a mob. The way to dampen the effects of this problem is not to retreat into anonymity ourselves, but to make being real and identifiable the norm. As in the real world, the fewer people who know each other, the more dangerous the neighborhood. The real way to “go social,” if they wanted to, would not be to accumulate more page friends or message followers, but rather to get their friends and followers to befriend and follow one another. That’s how to create a culture in a peer-to-peer, networked medium. Content was never king, contact is. For the person who understands code, the whole world reveals itself as a series of decisions made by planners and designers for how the rest of us should live. Not just computers, but everything from the way streets are organized in a town to the way election rules (are tilted for a purpose vote for any three candidates) begin to look like what they are: sets of rules developed to promote certain outcomes. Once the biases become apparent, anything becomes possible. The world and its many arbitrary systems can be hacked.","Maybe I'm just too immersed in this, but everything said here seems to be the most conventional wisdom - nothing I haven't heard. Shame, because I thought it was going to be about teaching the lay-person the importance of programming."
The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger,Bud Labitan,0615241298,1,"Conceptualizing “Intrinsic business value on a per-share basis” should be learned by every good investor and every good earnings manager. For a quick start to understanding a business, take a look at a company’s Free Cash Flow to the Firm, (FCFF). It is the amount of cash left over after the payment of the investments and taxes. ( FCFF = NOP – Taxes – Net Investment – Net Change in Working Capital ). If FCFF is solid, then the business is serving customers and is making a profit. A business generates revenue by selling its products and services. In generating revenue, a business incurs expenses—salaries, cost of goods sold (CGS), selling and general administrative expenses (SGA), research and development (R&D). The difference between operating revenue and operating expense is Operating Income or Net Operating Profit. The key figures for us to focus upon are the numbers seen after all the costs are accounted for. The best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return. The worst business to own is one that must, or will, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return. Unfortunately, the first type of business is very hard to find: Most high-return businesses need relatively little capital. Shareholders of such a business usually will benefit if it pays out most of its earnings in dividends. A good business will have a loyal followership or customer base. The wonderful ones will have some additional sort of pricing power. A study of financial history is also useful for building our knowledge base about businesses and the economic times they compete in. I like “The New York Times Century of Business” by Floyd Norris. To understand a business, figure out what results it is achieving, why it is getting those results, and what could happen to change what is causing those results. Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett insist on spending quiet time to just sit and think. Charlie Munger said: “That is very uncommon in American business. We read and think. So Warren and I do more reading and thinking and less doing than most people in business. We do that because we like that kind of a life.” Throughout his life, a wise man engages in practice of all his useful, rarely used skills, many of them outside his discipline, as a sort of duty to his better self. If he reduces the number of skills he practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he will naturally drift into error from man with a hammer tendency. His learning capacity will also shrink as he creates gaps in the latticework of theory he needs as a framework for understanding new experience. It is also essential for a thinking man to assemble his skills into a checklist that he routinely uses. I learned the value of the ""scuttlebutt' approach: Go out and talk to competitors, suppliers, customers to find out how an industry or a company really operates. A thorough understanding of the business, obtained by using Phil's techniques, combined with the quantitative discipline taught by Ben, will enable one to make intelligent investment commitments. Charlie Munger recommended the autobiography of Les Schwab “Les Schwab Pride in Performance: Keep It Going,” at the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. According to Munger, “Schwab ran tire shops in the Midwest and made a fortune by being shrewd in a tough business by having good systems.” Look for the protective “Moat” around a business’s economic castle. Is it enduring or sustainable? Time is the friend of the wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre. You might think this principle is obvious, but I had to learn it the hard way. In fact, I had to learn it several times over. This ability to endure over time, in good times and in bad, and continue to earn a solid profit is an important competitive advantage. And, sometimes, that comes about because of decent economics plus superior managements who work to build an even stronger moat. Don't lose sight of the big question: Are there barriers to entry that allow us to do things that other firms cannot? There are really only three sustainable competitive advantages: 1. Supply. A company has this edge when it controls an important resource: A company may have a proprietary technology that is protected by a patent. 2. Demand. A company can control a market because customers are loyal to it, either out of habit - to a brand name, for example - or because the cost of switching to a different product is too high. 3. Economies of scale. If your operating costs remain fixed while output increases, you can gain a significant edge because you can offer your product at lower cost without sacrificing profit margins. Having a superior competitive advantage of handsome retained earnings, a fine business selling in the market place for less than intrinsic value, should repurchase its shares at this lower market price. In a difficult business, no sooner is one problem solved than another surfaces - never is there just one cockroach in the kitchen. Second, any initial advantage you secure will be quickly eroded by the low return that the business earns. We depend on a group of thoughtful managers who are able to consider their situations and make wise decisions. Able and Trustworthy Managers will build intrinsic value and competitive advantage. Able but greedy managers will steal from you. One question I always ask myself in appraising a business is how I would like, assuming I had ample capital and skilled personnel, to compete with it. Once we know the estimated intrinsic value, we can compare that figure with the market price and see if we are getting a bargain. If we are getting a bargain, this bargain is our Margin of Safety. The value of any stock, bond, or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows - discounted at an appropriate interest rate - that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset. Why discounted back to the present? Discount it back to the present because, over time, inflation tends to decrease the dollar’s purchasing power. First, we try to stick to businesses we believe we understand. That means they must be relatively simple and stable in character. If a business is complex or subject to constant change, we're not smart enough to predict future cash flows. Incidentally, that shortcoming doesn't bother us. What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know. An investor needs to do very few things right as long as he or she avoids big mistakes. Second, and equally important, we insist on a margin of safety in our purchase price. If we calculate the value of a common stock to be only slightly higher than its price, we're not interested in buying. We believe this margin-of-safety principle, so strongly emphasized by Ben Graham, to be the cornerstone of investment success. Charlie Munger once stated: ""Warren often talks about these discounted cash flows, but I've never seen him do one."" Warren Buffett responded: ""It's sort of automatic... It ought to just kind of scream at you that you've got this huge margin of safety."" We define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. Anyone calculating intrinsic value necessarily comes up with a highly subjective figure. This figure will change both as estimates of future cash flows are revised and as interest rates move. Despite its fuzziness, however, intrinsic value is all-important and is the only logical way to evaluate the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. Buffett in top form, buying quality bargains. The key to successful investing was the purchase of shares in good businesses when market prices were at a large discount from underlying business values. Look for understandable first-class businesses, with enduring competitive advantages, accompanied by first-class managements, available at a bargain price.",Another overview of the investment approach of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.
What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,Haruki Murakami,0307389839,1,"I can’t grasp much of anything without putting down my thoughts in writing, so I had to actually get my hands working and write these words. Otherwise, I’d never know what running means to me. When writing a novel. I stop every day right at the point where I feel I can write more. Do that, and the next day’s work goes surprisingly smoothly. To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm. This is the important thing for long-term projects. Once you set the pace, the rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed - and to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can manage. I run in order to acquire a void. Who in the world could possibly have warm feelings, or something like them, for a person who doesn’t compromise, who instead, whenever a problem crops up, locks himself away alone in a closet? But is it ever possible for a professional writer to be liked by people? I’d been given a wonderful opportunity to be a novelist - a chance you just don’t get every day - and a natural desire sprang up to take it as far as I possibly could. You can’t keep up that kind of life forever. Just as with school, you enter it, learn something, and then it’s time to leave. You really need to prioritize in life, figuring out in what order you should divide up your time and energy. If you don’t get that sort of system set by a certain age, you’ll lack focus and your life will be out of balance. I placed the highest priority on the sort of life that lets me focus on writing, not associating with all the people around me. I felt that the indispensable relationship I should build in my life was not with a specific person, but with an unspecified number of readers. As long as I got my day-to-day life set so that each work was an improvement over the last, then many of my readers would welcome whatever life I chose for myself. (That only 1 out of 10 people really love any business:) I had to make sure that the one person who did like the place really liked it. In order to make sure he did, I had to make my philosophy and stance clear-cut, and patiently maintain that stance no matter what. This is what I learned through running a business. The most important thing we ever learn at school is the fact that the most important things can’t be learned at school. Muscles are hard to get and easy to lose. Fat is easy to get and hard to lose. There are three reasons I failed. Not enough training. Not enough training. And not enough training. That’s it in a word. Not enough overall exercise, plus not getting my weight down. Without knowing it, I’d developed a sort of arrogant attitude, convinced that just a fair-to-middling amount of training was enough for me to do a good job. It’s pretty thin, the wall separating healthy confidence and unhealthy pride. You really do get only what you pay for. One of my basic rules for training: I never take two days off in a row. No matter what, though, I keep up my running. Running every day is a kind of lifeline for me, so I’m not going to lay off or quit just because I’m busy. If I used being busy as an excuse not to run, I’d never run again. I have only a few reasons to keep on running, and a truckload of them to quit. All I can do is keep those few reasons nicely polished. Focus - the ability to concentrate all your limited talents on whatever’s critical at the moment. Without that you can’t accomplish anything of value, while, if you can focus effectively, you’ll be able to compensate for an erratic talent or even a shortage of it. I generally concentrate on work for three or four hours every morning. I sit at my desk and focus totally on what I’m writing. I don’t see anything else, I don’t think about anything else. Endurance. If you concentrate on writing three or four hours a day and feel tired after a week of this, you’re not going to be able to write a long work. What’s needed for a writer of fiction - at least one who hopes to write a novel - is the energy to focus every day for half a year, or a year, two years. Raymond Chandler once confessed that even if he didn’t write anything, he made sure he sat down at his desk every single day and concentrated. I understand the purpose behind his doing this. This is the way Chandler gave himself the physical stamina a professional writer needs, quietly strengthening his willpower. This sort of daily training is indispensable. Most of what I know about writing I’ve learned through running every day. These are practical, physical lessons. How much can I push myself? How much rest is appropriate - and how much is too much? How far can I take something and still keep it decent and consistent? When does it become narrow-minded and inflexible? How much should I be aware of the world outside, and how much should I focus on my inner world? To what extent should I be confident in my abilities, and when should I start doubting myself? To deal with something unhealthy, a person needs to be as healthy as possible. As an action that deviates from the ordinary yet doesn’t violate basic values, you’d expect it to afford you a special sort of self-awareness. It should add a few new elements to your inventory in understanding who you are. And as a result, your view of your life, its colors and shape, should be transformed. No matter how slow I might run, I wasn’t about to walk. That was the rule. Break one of my rules once, and I’m bound to break many more. Mantra to self when running: I’m not a human. I’m a piece of machinery. I don’t need to feel a thing. Just forge on ahead. My knee has started to hurt. Like most of the troubles in life it came on all of a sudden, without any warning.","This novelist runs every day, including many marathons. This book is his thoughts about running and how it relates to other things in work and life."
Confessions of a Serial Entrepreneur,Stuart Skorman,0787987328,1,"Each time, I introduced a new business model to the industry and strove to enrich my customers' lives in some way. When my business was up and running and growing, I couldn't wait to move on and invent something else. The essence of an entrepreneur is the die-hard belief that we are the only one able to make things happen. Starting a business is often an act of desperation. Entrepreneurs are desperate for success and accomplishment. Desperation pushes us to take huge risks, leave comfort and security behind, and allow a business to consume our lives. To make sure their customers knew Miracle Mart was the cheapest store in town, they charged only a nickel for a bottle of Coca-Cola when the same bottle was a dime everywhere else. Deeply discounting Coke, a product everyone knew the price of, gave customers the impression that everything in the store was a steal. If, while driving down the street, we passed a vacant lot, he'd say, ""That'd make a great spot for a hamburger place,"" or ""I haven't seen a car wash for five miles. That's what this neighborhood needs: a car wash."" He was always right. Know you need a mentor. The more ambitious you are, the more help you'll require. Prioritize a mentoring relationship. Seek out a good mentor just as you'd seek out a great location, a favorable contract, or a business partner. Make a list of the qualities you'd like to find in a mentor, and don't settle for the first person who comes along. What can you do to return the favor? Your contribution may be something as simple as cleaning your mentor's office or doing errands-look for a need your mentor has and fill it. Always be on the lookout for mentors; they may be in unlikely places. Join a professional organization. The more you circulate in your chosen field, the more likely you are to bump into potential mentors. If you start any business counting the hours you work or limiting the tasks you're willing to shoulder, your business will fail. (On being a band manager:) I got smart enough to ignore my taste in music. Instead I stuffed cotton in my ears, sat on the stage, and watched the audience. A band's success can be predicted by the audience's reaction. Learning how to focus on my customers' tastes rather than my own was an important, early business lesson that has served me well. Any successful businessperson knows you have to do whatever it takes to get objective market research. Just spouting off about what you think the market wants or needs isn't good enough. Being a musician and making a living as one are two different things. If you want to earn a living, you must get paid by someone who values your services. The question entertainers need to ask themselves is not, Are we talented? but, Do we have drawing power? I left the music business at age 25 and retired. This was the start of a work pattern I continued all the way up to age fifty-seven: busting my butt for two or three years, burning out, and following up with a quiet period where I rest up for my next big adventure. When creating a new business, design it to attract publicity from the beginning. Think about your business idea from a public relations standpoint. Can the business get good press? Is there a story? Is it topical? Is the business something people will want to read about? One of the most important PR decisions is your business's name and tagline. Before christening your business, ask yourself, Does the name get people's attention? Does it have positive associations? Does it sound authentic? Can the name help get us good press? Don't be afraid to choose a name that some people hate. You want something a little edgy because people respect a businessperson who takes risks. Watch out for enthusiasts without experience; they are often better customers than workers. If a job similar to the one you are filling isn't listed on an applicant's resume, tread carefully. People who haven't held similar positions in the past might not know enough about themselves to realize they won't be happy. I was out to understand what made these stubborn small-town entrepreneurs tick. when a customer says he returned a movie but the store's computer can't find it. The employee was trained to say, ""No problem, our mistake,"" and to note the discrepancy on the customer's file. We had a three-strikes-and-you're-out policy. 30+ years of business wisdom into a single lesson: get to know your customers. Let people with the best resumes make the decisions. Of course, a company's leader ultimately must take responsibility for the decision, but the best leaders let themselves be heavily influenced by advisers with the appropriate experience and training. Decide whether you belong in the game. I'm not a gambler. Professional poker players approach the game as a business. They recognize that gambling is bad for business. to gamble is to rely on luck instead of facts. The professionals cash in by waiting for gamblers to come along. What if there are no businesses to study? Say you've done your homework, canvassed the landscape, and no one is doing what you're proposing. Usually that's bad news, which means you should take a step back. There are millions of smart people in the world. We all have access to the same information and therefore all hatch similar ideas. Most likely, there are reasons that someone has not already capitalized on your idea. Figureout what the roadblocks are before you get started. I was a success, which meant the challenge was over and it was time for me to move on. Be AggressiveAggressive poker players win by scaring other players into making mistakes. In business, one way to succeed is to scare your competitors. wait until you have great cards before playing, so your odds of winning aremuch better than those of people who play every hand they are dealt. In business, this practice translates as being conservative. For instance, opening up a franchise might be a smarter move than starting a company from scratch. Half of succeeding in business is being in the right place at the right time; the other half is recognizing that time when it comes. Base your decision on logic, not emotion. Many people let feelings and passion steer them toward a business, but don't let your heart call the shots. Starting a business is a logical decision. Stay focused on the important questions: Who are you? Where do you fit? Who are your competitors?Stick with the familiar. Choose something that feels comfortable. If it doesn't feel like a natural fit for your skills and personality, pick something else.Prioritize fun. If you don't enjoy your work, you won't succeed. Look for a business with the potential to be deeply satisfying. Enter an established field. If your business idea is 100 percent original, there is a reason that no one else is doing it. Look around at what other businesspeople are doing. What works for them, and what doesn't? Both mistakes and innovations are best learned by watching others make them first. Focus on short-term goals. Don't get ahead of yourself. Forget about designing a business for the next decade; instead, design it for the next year. Unless you are focused on profit when you design your business, it will probably fail. if an idea is obvious but nobody else has tried it, there is probably a good reason. borrow as much as you can from others. Don't look for out-of-the-box solutions. Find other people who are either doing what you want to do or doing pieces of your plan. Nothing is so new that someone hasn't already mastered parts of it. Nine times out of ten, someone has already solved the puzzle you are flummoxed over. In other professions, mistakes can be a disaster; surgeons, lawyers, and accountants are paid a premium for perfection. But mistakes are a daily part of life for serial entrepreneurs. When you start a business, you need to focus on profit If you prioritize helping people, your attention won't be on making money, and your business will fail. pick a model where helping people is profitable. the education business, an industry where making a profit is notoriously difficult, I was a rich guy buoyed by the security and comfort of my wealth. I was no longer hungry or desperate, two qualities a start-up CEO needs.","Personal tales, almost an autobiography, of someone who created a wide range of businesses, both successful and not.

Life Without Lawyers,Philip K. Howard,0393065669,1,"Does the law require that all trees be cut down, because some youths may climb them and fall? The only freedom that deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs. In an effort to avoid human error, we have created legal structures based on an unspoken premise that correctness can be proved or programmed in advance. Today we assume unquestioningly that any activity will be more effective if we detail in advance how to get the job done. The American belief in social mobility rather than status: People can strive to get somewhere. Immigrants understand this better than anyone. “Here a man can go as far as his abilities will carry him. No traditions hamper him. No limitations are set except those within himself.” Growing up in the South, I remember wondering how people found a sense of purpose in their lives. It was hard to see much originality underneath all those southern manners. It was as if everyone were stamped out of a politeness mold. Better than any society in history, America shed the baggage of cultural self-consciousness and let people access everything that was in them. Americans acted; they didn’t wring their hands about how to act. They looked ahead, not over their shoulders. The evil of modern law is that it has infected daily choices with a debilitating legal self-consciousness. Americans no longer feel free to do what they feel is right. One-sided focus on possible wrongdoing doesn’t acknowledge the need to preserve an open field of freedom so people can live their lives. Freedom today is just whatever’s left over after everyone’s made their legal demands. Law sets boundaries that proscribe wrongful conduct. These same boundaries also protect an area for free choice in all other matters. The forgotten idea is the second principle - that law must affirmatively protect an area of free choice, including freedom from legal interference. The range of exploration from home by 9-year-olds is about 10 percent what it was in 1970. Only 15% of children walk or bike to school, compared to 50% in 1970. Kids have been taught that outside means danger - from cars, from adults, from the uncertainty of the real world. These modern rights are usually asserted in someone’s own interest. The new rights give power to people to demand something from other free citizens. It is a nice trait of the American character, that we want everyone to have the same opportunities as others. Modern rights are not a tool of freedom, however. They are a form of tyranny, allowing some citizens to wield coercive power over others for their own benefit. Distrust of authority: Americans can’t stand the idea of people making decisions that affect other people. Giving someone authority to make balancing choices is almost unthinkable. Who knows what prejudices lurk inside someone’s soul? We live in a diverse culture and, we’re told, one person’s values of right and wrong should not be imposed on someone else. We want automatic fairness. There’s this idea nowadays that any negative outcome must violate your rights. What’s required to put this genie back in its bottle is as simple as it is revolutionary: Restore the authority of people with responsibility to make judgments that strive toward balance. People will always make selfish demands on common resources, unless there’s a mechanism that draws the line on behalf of all society. Moving the needle back to the center - generally the goal of good public policy - requires restoring the authority for balancing. The distrust of authority is palpable. The core assumption is that society can be organized without human intervention. The idea of a judge making legal rulings on standards of care struck her as an invitation to abuse, a form of tyranny instead of a key ingredient of the rule of law. This is the mind-set of our time. No idea is more unpalatable to the modern mind than giving someone authority to make choices that affect other people. That’s why we have law, or so we believe - to dictate or oversee almost any life activity. Law, we think, should protect people from the judgment of others. The goal was to protect against unfair authority, but the effect was to preclude fair authority. As an unintended part of the bargain, we lost much of our freedom. Law is supposed to be a structure that promotes our freedom. It does this by setting boundaries that define an open field of freedom. Instead law has moved in on daily life, becoming the arbiter of potentially every disagreement in a free society. We’ve asked law to do too much - trying to enforce fairness in daily relations is not freedom, but a form of utopia that predictably degenerates into squealing demands for me, me, me. Setting outer boundaries allows people to make free choices, whether it’s running the classroom, managing the department, or putting an arm around a crying child. Bring law into daily disagreements, and you might as well give a legal club to the most unreasonable and selfish person in the enterprise. The quest for objective truth is not merely futile, however. It is actively destructive of good judgment. People who feel they must demonstrate the correctness of decisions, studies have repeatedly shown, will make worse decisions. The path back to freedom is letting all citizens, especially those in positions of leadership, be free to act on their best judgment. “Wherever and whenever one person is found adequate to the discharge of a duty, it is worse executed by two persons, and scarcely done at all if three or more are employed.” - George Washington The more choices someone is able to make, the more checked he will be by public scrutiny. “There is no danger in power, if only it be not irresponsible, if it be divided…it is obscured; and if it be obscured it is made irresponsible.” - Woodrow Wilson An effective leader does not hew to the path of legal conformity, but will almost always make choices that are unexpected. “Effective leadership has to be based on intuitions that are correct, notwithstanding doctrines that deny their correctness.” - Chester Barnard The litmus test of leadership is trust by others. “The only definition of a leader is someone who has followers.” - Peter Drucker We have to make a choice: It’s either leaders or lawyers. Philosophers such as Erich Fromm have argued that the legal cage we’ve built for ourselves just reflects our own “fear of freedom.” This miracle of a consensus leader is unlikely, however. So we sit on the fence, hating lawyers and scared of leaders. Leadership shifts the goal from the individual to the common good. That’s the job of a leader - to make choices for the common enterprise. Bill Bradley has talked about how “looking to only two sources of solutions - government or market - is like sitting on a two-legged stool. The third leg of the stool - civil society - is missing.” Civil society is missing because it was suffocated by centralized bureaucracy. Many societies that fail take some important resource for granted and deplete it without understanding the long-term consequences - for example, cutting down all the trees on Easter Island or the early Nordic settlers in Greenland allowing sheep to graze on grass that wouldn’t grow back. America’s greatest natural resource is a culture that unleashed the power of individuals. The more miserable a man is, the more he dreads every sort of change, lest it may make him more wretched still.","I really liked his TED talk (search ted.com), and this book elaborates on the idea.

Crash Proof 2.0,Peter Schiff,047047453X,1,"Replace your endangered U.S. dollar holdings with a portfolio of foreign securities that offer less long-term risk, significantly higher current yields, and more upside potential. It isn’t the dollars you are trying to conserve; it is the purchasing power that those dollars represent. In “communist China” entrepreneurs have more freedom than they do in America. It is far easier to go into business there than here. The country with the greatest currency risk is our own. Here at home we call it inflation risk or purchasing power risk. The way to avoid it is by investing in those foreign currencies that are expected to rise significantly as the dollar falls. Of the three sources of profit, dividends are most assured, assuming you selected stocks with sound fundamentals. If the stock goes down but the currency goes up, you’ve got the dividends so you’re two out of three. Most of the time you’re going to get at least two out of three. In the worst-case scenario, you’re going to get two down and one up: currency down and stock down, but the dividend paid and offsetting the currency or the stock. I strongly recommend you put all your invested money in foreign currencies. I will be talking mainly about the equity markets, although all investors should have an emergency fund in the form of cash equivalents and near-cash, such as money market funds or bank certificates of deposit (CDs). My preference for equities is grounded in my belief that all governments that issue fiat currency will inflate, which will tend to reduce the purchasing power of those currencies. By owning equities, whose income streams and value can rise to offset inflation, we get a hedge against foreign as well as domestic inflation. Currency gains on foreign bonds or certificates of deposit are taxed as ordinary income at maturity. By investing in equities we can either put off taxes on foreign currency gains indefinitely or realize those gains but pay taxes at the lower capital gains rate. I buy when prices represent value, my portfolios have growth potential, but I view capital gains as a bonus. Dividends paid by a growing company will usually increase as profits grow, but dividend growth is also a bonus. Current dividend income must justify the purchase. Don’t give your foreign stock order to any brokerage firm, discount or full-service, that will route it through a Pink Sheets market maker for execution. Not only will you get hosed on the price, but you’ll potentially pay a fat commission on top of that. Stay away from the Pink Sheets, period. Key to my strategy for trading foreign stocks is to have your order executed directly on the foreign exchange that lists the stock you want to trade. That ensures you get the best price. To trade directly in foreign markets, you will need a broker that specializes in foreign stocks. 1. What exchange rate do I get? Currency conversion should cost you 10 to 15 basis points 2. Can I be certain my order will be executed directly on the local foreign exchange, and not by a market maker in the United States using the Pink Sheets? 3. Can I place limit orders (orders restricting execution to a specified price or better) in foreign currencies? 4. Can I elect to receive dividends as well as proceeds from sales directly in a foreign currency? 5. Are there minimum transaction amounts, special fees for overseas orders, other hidden costs, or miscellaneous fees? Please provide a list of all charges. Your best bet would be to ask your broker to help you buy a no-load mutual fund invested in foreign money market instruments, such as the Merk Hard Currency Fund. Since we’re looking for conservative stocks, we don’t want to jump from the frying pan into the fire. So we avoid emerging, developing markets and developed markets where there is any question of political risk. Structure a diversified portfolio of conservative stocks with high dividend yields in developed markets. Canada, which, surprisingly, now has one of the best-positioned economies in the world. We’ll be looking at industrial sectors as our next step, but Canada happens to be part of the natural resource block, which includes Australia and New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, South Africa and the Scandinavian countries, like Norway. My two favorites there are Hong Kong and Singapore, followed by Japan. Initial impact of a dollar collapse will be most disruptive in Asia, while Europe will be affected to a much lesser extent. As a result, in the short run, non-Asian markets might do better, but in the long run Asia has the most to gain from the dollar’s collapse. Electric, oil, and gas utilities are attractive equity investments. Real estate, especially when it can be owned in the form of property trusts, as it can in most mature foreign markets, has both high yield and tax advantages. I prefer property trusts that are mostly commercial. When you’re buying property trusts, you’re really not in the stock market; you’re in the real estate market, and the rents are coming to you in the form of dividends. What’s good about it is that you have diversification, immediate liquidity, lower transaction costs, and professional management, and you don’t have to worry about collecting rents or getting insurance. It’s a very convenient and easy way to buy real estate, particularly if it’s halfway around the world. I am particularly bullish on commodities. Now my thinking is that as the dollar collapses, the currencies that will rise the most will be Asian, particularly Chinese. We’re going to see tremendous demand for the raw materials necessary to satisfy the demands of the far wealthier emerging Asian economies, once their full purchasing power is finally unleashed. Commodities, natural resources, raw materials—all names for one sector—are therefore a great play in my judgment. Many Canadian oil and gas companies pay dividends of 12 percent to 15 percent. Coal producers pay dividends averaging something like 11 percent, and companies mining nickel, zinc, and lead are paying 7 percent to 10 percent. What we won’t be buying are companies that have significant exposure to the United States. Those companies will be good candidates to buy after the dollar collapses and their stock prices fall as a result of lost export sales. Have exposure to the foreign currency through companies that generate their revenues in their own local markets (a Japanese retailer would be an example), not by exporting to the United States. It is important that investors understand basic analysis and valuation tools so they can understand the language of research reports, corporate financial information, and financial news. with relative simplicity and convenience, you can have a diversified portfolio of conservative foreign equities and earn an annual dividend yield of around 8 percent. stocks of the caliber we’ve been talking about will probably never need to be sold and will provide a lifetime of increasing income. That when augmented by rises in the value of the principal producing it, will likely offset declines in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar Crash Proof is subtitled “How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse”, not “How to Profit from the Coming Stock Market Collapse.” The economic collapse is still in its early stages, its progress being delayed in ways that only ensures greater devastation when the process concludes. my enthusiasm for commodities stocks, such as copper, lead, nickel, agriculture, and energy, is stronger than ever with a resurgence in demand and limited capacity promising higher prices and huge gains. I am certain that the recent sharp decline in commodity prices will reverse, and that bull markets will return stronger then ever. My greatest fear is that people who stayed in cash and think they did the right thing based on 2008 will stay in cash too long and watch their cash lose its purchasing power. For now those still holding cash feel like they dodged a bullet. However, what they fail to realize is that they are standing on a land mine! What percentage of your overall portfolio should be in physical gold and mining shares? My recommendation would be 10 percent to 30 percent gold-related investments and 70 percent to 90 percent conservative foreign stocks. The more aggressive investor would weight gold higher, while the more conservative investor, particularly if current income is required, would weight it lower. So an aggressive investor could have a $1 million portfolio with $700,000 in conservative foreign stocks and $300,000 in gold, apportioned as I suggested, while a more conservative investor might have $900,000 in stocks and only $100,000 in gold. that gold stood its ground in a strong dollar environment means it should perform extraordinarily well in the weak dollar environment we are ultimately headed for. Remember that the only reason the dollar became the world’s reserve currency was that it was not only backed by gold, it was redeemable in gold. The whole idea behind having reserves behind a currency is that currencies in and of themselves have no intrinsic value. Now that the dollar is backed by nothing, it makes no sense to hold dollar reserves, which is the same thing as having no reserves at all. So I think we are going to be moving in the direction of gold becoming a greater percentage of central bank reserves relative to dollars or other leading currencies. China recently announced it had quietly doubled its gold reserves from 2 percent to 4 percent of its total reserves and is now the world’s leading gold producer. I continue to feel strongly that it is wise to have some gold and silver offshore and recommend the Perth Mint for the reasons I gave in the chapter. the Merk Hard Currency Fund is a no-load mutual fund that invests in a basket of hard currencies from countries with strong monetary policies chosen for their value as protection against the depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. If instead of buying a house now, you rent and invest the down payment money outside the United States, you’ll be able to afford a much bigger down payment in a few years and perhaps even own the house without any mortgage at all. If housing prices decline 50 to 60 percent and the dollar declines 70 percent, a $500,000 house would become a $200,000 I do not see a foreign stock sell-off combined with a bear market rally in the dollar happening a second time. In other words, I think it is unlikely we’ll see foreign stocks selling at such low valuations again, and think that holding cash will get increasingly risky as purchasing power declines, which it surely will. I see gold headed much higher, as discussed in the previous update. Bottom line? In my view, the big asset sell-off has come and gone, so I don’t see the same buying opportunities looking forward that argued for liquidity when I wrote the book, and I see more danger in holding cash. Inflation is about as sure a thing as anything these days. Since it clearly benefits debtors at the expense of creditors, since debt becomes repayable in cheaper dollars, the smart money would logically run up as much debt as possible, With mortgage rates below 5 percent, for example, it might make sense to buy a house that has dropped in price 40 or 50 percent, not because I think real estate has bottomed, but because if you can get a 30-year Freddie or Fannie mortgage, you can make money as a debtor. Even though real estate is going to lose value, the dollar will lose even more value, giving you a profit. Anybody owning a home that is unencumbered or has substantial equity should take out the biggest mortgage available while rates are below 5 percent. If you can borrow any where close to 5 percent it would make no sense not to do. I was even more surprised that the bursting, although devastating enough to create the crisis we’re currently experiencing, didn’t yield even greater fallout. Though I correctly anticipated that the powers that be, both here and abroad, would try hard to blow the bubble back up, I underestimated how effective their efforts would be. As a result, though some air has seeped out, a dangerous amount remains trapped inside. As long as these counterproductive and ill-fated efforts continue, so too will the slow leak. But sooner rather than later the rest of the air will come gushing out, and the real economic collapse will finally be upon us. Using a variety of tools and techniques as well as reading corporate reports and interviewing managers, fundamental analysts try to answer such questions as: • Is management up to the challenges it faces? Are there any succession problems? Are there any imminent changes in senior management? • Is the balance sheet strong enough, that is, liquid enough to pay current obligations, and not overloaded with debt? • Are sales and revenues increasing and is the company gaining share in a viable market? • Are expenses under control? • Are any major capital expenditures being planned? If so, how are they going to be financed? (An issuance of additional stock might cause dilution, a given increment of earnings spread over more shares, resulting in lower earnings per share.) • Did any special events affect last year’s earnings? • Are earnings per share increasing? • Is the company’s share price higher or lower than it should be relative to earnings per share? • To what extent are the company’s operations multinational? What is the exposure to foreign currency and political risks? ** YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL RATIOS: RATIOS THAT MEASURE PROFITABILITY: Operating profit margin: This is net operating profits divided by net sales. It is key to measuring a firm’s operating efficiency because it reflects purchasing and pricing policies and control of costs and expenses directly associated with the running of the business and the creation of sales. It excludes other income and expenses, interest, taxes, and depreciation. This ratio is meaningful when compared to different periods or to industry norms. Net profit margin: You get this by dividing net income by net sales, and it measures management’s overall efficiency. In other words, it goes beyond operating efficiency and measures management’s success in borrowing money at favorable rates, investing idle cash, and taking advantage of tax benefits. Businesses that work on volume (the quick nickel as opposed to the slow dollar) will have lower net profit margins. Return on equity: Divide net income by stockholders’ equity. It is the bottom line as a percentage of the money shareholders have invested. The higher the better, as long as it doesn’t invite competition. RATIOS THAT MEASURE CORPORATE LIQUIDITY: Current ratio: This balance sheet ratio divides current assets by current liabilities. It measures the extent to which a company’s short-term creditors are covered by assets expected to be converted into cash within a year or less. Generally speaking, a ratio of 2 would be conservative, although much depends on the kind of company and the composition of its current assets. The more liquid the asset mix, the better. Quick ratio: This refines the current ratio by excluding inventory, the least readily salable current asset. The quick ratio, sometimes called the acid-test ratio, divides current liabilities into cash and equivalents plus accounts receivable. Ideally, this ratio would be 1. RATIOS THAT MEASURE LEVERAGE: Debt to total assets: Here total liabilities are divided by total assets to measure the proportion of assets financed with debt as opposed to equity. Owners usually like a high ratio because it means they are being financed with other people’s money. Banks and other lenders like a low ratio because it is a cushion in the event of liquidation. Long-term debt to total capitalization: This takes total long-term debt (bonds and term loans from other lenders) and divides it by total long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity. It measures the portion of permanent financing that is debt as opposed to equity. Where the ratio is low, it might benefit the company’s owners to issue bonds rather than stock or otherwise to increase its leverage. Debt to equity (debt ratio): This most basic of ratios divides total liabilities by total stockholders’ equity and measures the reliance on creditors, short- and long-term, to finance total assets. A high debt ratio makes borrowing difficult and a low ratio makes owners feel assured they will be protected in liquidation, since assets tend to shrink. Fixed-charge coverage: Earnings before taxes and interest charges divided by interest charges plus lease payments results in a figure showing how many times fixed charges are covered by earnings. Put another way, it tells the extent to which earnings could shrink before the company is unable to meet its contractual interest and lease payments. Failure to meet interest payments is an event of default in most debt agreements. The ratio is sometimes calculated using interest charges only. RATIOS THAT MEASURE STOCK VALUES: Price to earnings: Popularly called the P/E, this ratio is the market price of a share divided by the earnings per share, computed using the previous 12 months (trailing P/E) or, less commonly, estimated (projected) 12-month earnings (forward P/E). It reflects the value the market puts on a company’s earnings and on the prospect of future earnings. The ratio is most meaningful when compared to those of other companies of the same type and size. Price to book value: The market price of a share divided by the book value per share, excluding intangible assets, provides an indication of whether a company is over- or undervalued by the market relative to its net asset value. Since the basic rules of accounting require that inventories be carried on the books at the lower of cost or market value, and fixed assets, such as plant and equipment, are carried at their depreciated value, which may be more or less than their market value, the ratio is only the roughest measure of what shares would be worth in the event of liquidation. Having said that, though, there is no other ratio that relates share value to asset value, and a relatively (compared to similar companies) low price-to-book ratio might well be a sign of value and warrant closer analysis. Price to sales: This ratio is market price per share divided by sales and revenues per share. It is preferred by some analysts to the P/E ratio because whereas earnings are subject to accounting methodology and are affected by a multitude of variables, sales and revenues tend to be less volatile and a more reliable indication of how successfully a company is competing in its marketplace. Dividend payout: By dividing dividends per common share by earnings per common share, we learn what percentage of its earnings a company pays out in dividends. As a general rule, the more mature a company is, the higher its dividend payout ratio is, since rapidly growing companies tend to reinvest their earnings to finance growth. Utilities and property trusts usually have high dividend payout ratios. Dividend yield: This is the company’s annual dividend as a percentage of its market price. It is calculated by taking the company’s most recently reported quarterly dividend and annualizing it, that is, multiplying it by four, then dividing by the market price per share. Dividend yield, as discussed previously, is the cash-on-the-barrelhead reward for owning a company’s stock and is the basic feature of all the stocks I own.","Opinion on what to do if the dollar crashes, as the author is strongly speculating that it will.

Rapt,Winifred Gallagher,1594202109,1,"The things that you don’t attend to in a sense don’t exist, at least for you. Beowulf: “Every life has more than enough sadness and more than enough joy.” Neuroscience’s truly groundbreaking insight into attention is the discovery that its basic mechanism is a process of selection. This two-part neurological sorting operation allows you to focus by enhancing the most compelling, or “salient,” physical object or “high-value” mental subject in your ken and suppressing the rest. Outside an elite scientific circle, however, this finding’s implications for everyday life have been stunningly unremarked. We must resist the temptation to drift along, reacting to whatever happens to us next, and deliberately select targets, from activities to relationships, that are worthy of our finite supplies of time and attention. The term distracted once referred not just to a loss or dilution of attention but also to confusion, mental imbalance, and even madness. Machines are not at fault. The real problem is that we don’t appreciate our own ability to use attention to select and create truly satisfying experience. Instead of exercising this potential, we too often take the lazy way out, settle for less, and squander our mental money and precious time on whatever captures our awareness willy-nilly, no matter how disappointing the consequences. Once you’re familiar with a situation, your top-down conviction that you know what’s going on can cause you to miss even dramatic alterations to it, such as the substitution of a horse’s head for a human one. It’s hard to overstate the implications for daily life, from finding fresh solutions to problems at work to keeping the zest in marriage. This neurological “biased competition,” which was discovered by the neuroscientists John Duncan of Cambridge University and Robert Desimone of MIT, Just thinking about paying attention affects your brain, revving it up for the actual experience. Depending on how the competition for your attention is biased, whether by you or your neurons, you can have very different experiences of the same scene. All day long, you focus on what seems most important and suppress what doesn’t. If you happen to gaze idly at your backyard, bottom-up attention makes sure you won’t miss that salient blazing red maple tree and leaves the rest in a greenish blur. However, if you peer out with a top-down aim, such as checking on your dog, you’ll see Rex but might not even notice the maple. If I ask, ‘What does your chair’s pressure feel like on your back?’ you’ll instantly access that information. That tactile input was present all along, but when you turn up its volume, you permit it to come up to the level of your awareness. Magic is what happens when you’re paying attention to something else. Hold your eyes still and just move your attention around. If you want to master and retain certain material, from a bird’s name to your Speak French Like a Native tapes, you’d best really pay attention to it in the first place. Princeton cognitive psychologist Anne Treisman distinguishes between the slow, “narrow” attention that you paid to the nuthatch and the “broad” sort required when you must rapidly take in a complex new scene. Just as bad feelings constrict your attention so you can focus on dealing with danger or loss, good feelings widen it, so you can expand into new territory. Survey of 9,211 employees and managers showed that a worker’s tendency toward perfectionism, manifested by a persistent focus on small, inconsequential details and errors, correlated with an inability to distinguish between what is or isn’t doable. If your personality is also goal-oriented and controlled, you may be inclined toward the “instrumental,” take-care-of-business way of focusing. Yeager modestly credits his success more to his careful, pragmatic, instrumental attentional style than to machismo: “It was my fear that made me learn everything I could about my airplane and my emergency equipment, and kept me flying respectful of my machine and always alert in the cockpit.” This tendency to focus on the seemingly minor delights of a good, crisp apple or your favorite song on the radio is an important element in the construction of an optimistic, upbeat personality and corresponds with a greater overall satisfaction with life. Conversely, a chronic inability to focus on small opportunities to cheer up and enjoy yourself correlates with depression and its dour worldview. A well-developed executive network makes it easier to shift your attention from unproductive thoughts and feelings to the energizing, generative sort, which is a big advantage in the pursuit of the focused life. The word Attention is from the Latin for “reach toward”. Research by the Canadian psychologist Joanne Wood shows that if you want to feel better about who you are, you should concentrate on someone of lower status, but if you’re trying to get motivated, you should fix on a person who outranks you. When employees focus on how their efforts affect other people, rather than just on the details of their tasks, their sense of relationship boosts both their satisfaction and their productivity. Thus, cafeteria line workers who can see their satisfied customers are more contented than employees buried back in the kitchen. Choose activities that push you so close to the edge of your competence that they demand your absolute focus. If an activity is too easy, you lose focus and get bored. If it’s too hard, you become anxious, overwhelmed, and unable to concentrate. You’re in flow if you’re so focused on your work that time flies, your ego drops away, and you act intuitively. You think along the lines of “I was born for this” or “This is what it’s all about.” Be surprised by something every day. Happiness is a later reflection of the flow, rather than the result of the experience at the time. The trick is to turn the work into a kind of game, in which you focus closely on each aspect and try to figure out how to make it better. That way, you turn a rote activity into an engaging one. Pay as much attention to scheduling a productive evening or weekend as you do to your workday. The secret of fulfillment is to choose trouble for oneself in the direction of what one would like to become.","Well-intentioned book I couldn't stomach because of her awkwardly flowerly writing style. Also I've read a lot about focus and flow, so this was mostly a repeat covered better in other books."
Radical Honesty,Brad Blanton,0970693842,1,"The kind of lying that is most deadly is withholding, or keeping back information from someone we think would be affected by it. Sigmund Freud once said that psychoanalysis was to help people get from intense suffering to common unhappiness. We attribute all of our power to circumstances and say things like ""It makes me...."" Nietzsche said, ""Not doubt, certainty is what drives one insane."" Adult moralists are always angry people. The more the moralist is confronted with sloppy old experience, the more hysterical he or she becomes. Depending on an external frame of reference for social orientation leads you to try to manipulate other people to get what you want rather than getting it on your own. The person capable of telling the truth - still has roles to play, but is no longer trapped by them. The integrated person behind the role no longer has anything to hide, and can relate freely to the being he knows is hidden behind the roles others are playing. The person is then in charge, rather than the role. Begin here the practice of admitting how you feel when you feel it, speaking your secret judgments of others out loud, and constantly revealing your own petty and condescending ways. A successful life, in contrast, is one in which you can share with others openly, as your life happens, without all that rehearsal. Manipulation never works to get the result desired, but it always seems like it's just about to work. When you get what you said you wanted by manipulation, it is never enough. When you tell the truth and get what you want, getting what you want is like gravy - it feels like you are getting more than you ever hoped for, When I choose to be really honest and say what I experience and what I feel, I am showing that I can be trusted. This is the only kind of behavior that can bring about a response of trust. Trust is my response to a person that I know I can believe. Even if I dislike a person, I can trust him if he is honest with me, If I calculate and put on phony behavior in order to please you, you may love my behavior, but you cannot love me, because I have hidden my real existence behind this artificial behavior. Even when you love in response to my phony behavior, I cannot really receive your love. It is poisoned by my knowledge that the love is for the image I have created, not for me. I also have to be continually on guard to be surethat I maintain my image so that your love does not disappear. Since I have shut myself off from your love in this way, I will feel more lonely and unloved, and try even more desperately to manipulate myself and you in order to get this love. ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""It's not worth the struggle,"" and ""I've got to get out of this place,"" are products of incomplete disclosure of feelings toward, and thoughts about, others. Admit that who you are is not who you have been pretending to be. Praise yourself openly rather than manipulate to suck praise. Admit what a worm and a liar you are and go through the feelings that come up when you tell the truth about all of this. If you have never truly embarrassed yourself by what you had to say about yourself, you don't know shit from shinola about transformation. Who you are becomes more a description centered in the here and now, and less of a story about your life. Admit your ignorance. You confess that you developed your act in order not to appear lost and in hopes of finding your way by faking it. Then you admit that you are lost and faking it most of the time Before you acted smart; now you acknowledge ignorance like it is gold. This ego-attachment to having heroically survived the unfairness of the world that has to be given up Your hard-earned humility is quickly followed by pride in your humility. When we reveal more, we have less to hide. When we have less to hide, we are less worried about being found out. When we are less worried about being found out, we can pay better attention to someone else. Who you were before this second is already dead. When you tell the truth, you are free simply by virtue of describing what is so. Honest people speak simply, using language more to describe than to evaluate. Liars evaluate almost exclusively, only using enough description to make the story believable. History is full of pitiful, wonderful, dumb-assed heroes who sacrificed their lives to save those they loved from some bullshit threat that seemed real at the time but turned out to be imaginary. Anger is not a grenade. People resent being withheld from When people don't get good results from the direct expression of anger, the odds are the anger wasn't completely expressed. Probably one or both people were mad, but trying to be decent and fair at the same time. We must be willing to be angry rather than decent and fair, because angry, rather than decent and fair, is what we presently are. It seems unfair to resent people for things over which they have no control. Our decision not to express our resentment is based on a deeply held belief that our anger has to be justified. Speak in the present tense. Just because you are talking about something he did in the past, don't say, ""I resented you."" You still resent that person, right now, for what he did or said in the past, so state it in the present tense. Eventually, get specific. Even though it doesn't always feel this way, you probably resent the person for what he specifically did or said. Focus as much as you can on what did happen instead of what didn't happen. When you resent someone for what he didn't do - that is, violating your expectations - look back to what he said or did to create that expectation. Express your resentment to him for what he said or did. The unfair blaming is being done out loud. It is in the public domain where it can get cleared up, not in your secretive mind. What you want is the feeling of completion and wholeness that comes when you have told the truth about your petty, selfish mind and raised hell out loud like a fool.",First read the great article in Esquire magazine: http://www.esquire.com/features/honesty0707 This book just elaborates on that philosophy.
A Bull in China,Jim Rogers,1400066166,1,"China's version of alphabet soup: A-Shares : listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, available to domestic Chinese investors only. In renminbi. QFII institutionals can buy now, too. B-Shares : Started in mid-1990s solely for foreigners. (""A bubble developed, but eventually popped, until people were practically giving away B-Shares, which is why I started buying them in May 1999."") In 2001, Chinese citizens can access them if they could show they were starting accounts for foreigners, so money flooded in from overseas Chinese. Denominated in Hong Kong dollars on the Shenzhen exchange and US dollars on the Shanghai exchange. Due to lower demand, the long-term performance of B-share market has lagged far behind the A-share market. Many companies don't issue them and many Chinese won't touch them because they have the stigma of being foreign. This could lead to opportunities since many B-shares may eventually be merged with the A-share market. H-Shares : Hong Kong, freely open to all foreigners. Stock exchange of Hong Kong - Hang Seng index. S-Shares : Singapore exchange (hyperprosperous and defiantly capitalist Singapore). Over 14% of all listings in Singapore are Chinese companies. Freely tradable and convertible. N-Shares and ADRs : New York : Chinese companies listed directly on NY Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Once considered prestigious, but now Asians drive their own prices high enough and IPOs are a lot more expensive to mount in the US, so listings suffered and may slow. L-Shares : London, but like US, affected by new regulations in China discouraging this. Smaller Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in London has long been a destination for Chinese companies, with 46 current listings. J-Shares : Japan. There is no special advantage to what letter of share one holds - except of course if you can find the same share at a lower price. Prices can and will fluctuate. In early 2007, A-Shares were about double the price of B-Shares, and a third higher than H-Shares, so it's definitely worth it to keep tabs on this. The huge discounts in prices in Hong Kong may well disappear soon. Likewise, we should see the previous, comparitively lower prices for Chinese shares in Hong Kong rise as the mainland money seeks out cheaper Chinese stocks in Hong Kong and eventually everywhere else they can be found. My view, in general, is to stay away from frenzies and to look at IPOs if and when the boom declines. I never was one for flipping stocks immediately. My timing isn't that deft. I prefer to wait for a time when IPOs are more humdrum or even downright disregarded. -- Another strategy might be to invest in the province of Fujian, on the mainland just across from Taiwan. Most of Taiwan's original settlers came from Fujian and speak the local Fuzhou dialect. As a result of the ongoing tensions, real estate and other sectors are cheaper in Fujian compared to other developed regions of China. If real peace comes, Fujian is sure to boom. Whatever the risks, this much is clear : it's more scary to have all your savings in the U.S. stock market than it is to put a portion in China, whether investing in China's growth or as a hedge against a potential U.S. slowdown. China is already a formidable financial market in its own right. There will be enormous opportunities there no matter what happens on the other side of the world. Astute investors will get their confidence tested by periodic hurdles and occasional clouds of crisis. If you are as convinced as I am of China's promise, you will invest when fear depresses prices, and benefit in the long term. Agriculture, tourism, water resources, and selected service industries could have big upsides and may have good chances to weather dips or bubbles. It's good to answer these questions: (anywhere, not just China) - Does the company have too much debt? - Does it have good profit margins? - Does it grow nicely? - Does its management have strong incentives to succeed (large stock ownership or options)? - Does it have strong competition or is it a dominant player? - Is it a leader or a follower? - Is it in a growing market, for example iPods instead of horseshoes, BMWs instead of bicycles? -- What excites me most is the relative youth of the industry (tourism). Thing along the lines of the U.S. around the time the first decent highways were built and the concept of motels or Holiday Inns came into fashion. Think of Germany and Japan after the 2nd World War once the people there had recovered their resources enough to start seeing the world in a better way. Along with agriculture and water resources, travel - both foreign and especially domestic - could be one of the most ""recession-proof"" areas for investment. And once stocks can weather bad times, they get talked up even more.",Very specific book about investing in China's stock market.
Founders at Work,Jessica Livingston,1430210788,1,"Sabeer Bhatia: The one lesson I've learned is you've got to own the customer.

Seeing What Others Don't,Gary Klein,1610392515,0,"The fancy new BMW in front of them: The driver took a long drag on his cigarette, took it out of his mouth, and flicked the ashes onto the upholstery. “Did you see that? He just ashed his car,” the younger cop exclaimed. He couldn’t believe it. “That’s a new car and he just ashed his cigarette in that car.” That was his insight. Who would ash his cigarette in a brand new car? Not the owner of the car. Not a friend who borrowed the car. Possibly a guy who had just stolen the car. A refreshing antidote to all the depressing tales in the popular press about how irrational and biased we can be. Positive psychology applied to decision making as well. Decision researchers were trying to reduce errors, which is important, but we also needed to help people gain expertise and make insightful decisions. A sudden discovery, a jolt of excitement, a combination of ideas that fit tightly together, a feeling of confidence in the new direction. And no one else has the insight, despite receiving the same information. These cues tell us that an insight has just appeared. “Insight is when it happens, everything that happens afterward is different.” Grownups often narrow our attention to what matters most to us. Babies aren’t as good at attending to just one thing but seem to be more alert to anything unexpected. We can increase insights by exposing ourselves to lots of different ideas that might help us form new connections. Events that seem related to each other even though they don’t seem to have any obvious causal link. Coincidences are chance concurrences that should be ignored except that every so often they provide us with an early warning about a new pattern. The greatest obstacle to knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge. Curiosities make us wonder what’s going on, whereas contradictions make us doubt—“That can’t be right.”","I really wanted to like this book, but couldn't stomach the writing style.

Flex: Do Something Different,Ben Fletcher and Karen Pine,1907396543,0,"Personalities fit into certain categories: agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism and openness to experience. Why people should become imprisoned by the category they were assigned to? Behave in the best and most appropriate way as required by the situation. Have a fluid and flexible personality that could flex according to need. The more fixed a person’s personality is, the harder they’ll find it to adapt to the new. The more vulnerable they will be to stress. Our past habits, which make up our personality, hijack our ability to exercise free will or act differently. They inhibit awareness. Having a definite personality has some advantages: We like to be seen to be consistent. It becomes our personal trademark. It is also highly energy-efficient. Our success in life will depend on the capacity to be different people. We use only a fraction of our potential personality. We have a toolkit full of useful behaviours, yet repeatedly pull out the same one. Solutions do not come from an analysis of the past. My parents’ preoccupation with the toils of daily living meant they left me to work out for myself how to shape a life. I had to be totally self-led and self-sufficient. No one ever offered me advice or guidance, or said to me ‘do this’. I certainly became the architect and designer of my own life.","I give the basic idea a 9-out-of-10 rating: that we shouldn't declare and hold to a personality type (“I'm an introvert!

Cambodia's Curse,Joel Brinkley,1586487876,0,"Cambodia's Curse: The Modern History of a Troubled Land This was 1979. The Vietnam War had ended just four years earlier, but the convulsions it caused in neighboring states played out for years following. In Cambodia a few months after Saigon fell, Communist insurgents known as the Khmer Rouge overthrew Lon Nol, the military dictator. Two million Cambodians, one-quarter of the nation’s population, were killed during Pol Pot’s three and one-half years in power. Eighty percent of Cambodia’s teachers were killed and 95 percent of the doctors, along with almost everyone else who had an education. In December 1978 Vietnam had invaded Cambodia and quickly deposed the Khmer Rouge regime. In the months that followed, tens of thousands of refugees stumbled toward Thailand, A decade after their invasion, the Vietnamese had pulled out of Cambodia, in 1989, and left a puppet Marxist government in place. The Khmer Rouge, still directed by Pol Pot, continued waging a guerrilla war against the occupiers and their government. In 1992 and 1993 the United Nations occupied Cambodia. The state became a UN protectorate - the first and last time the United Nations tried anything so ambitious. The UN deployed 16,000 troops and 5,000 civil administrators. It ran the country for two years, and the whole enterprise cost $3 billion. The United Nations gave Cambodia a constitution that afforded the people - 5 million Khmer Rouge survivors - all the human rights and privileges of a modern democratic state. Then the UN staged elections. To everyone’s surprise, 90 percent of the electorate voted. Joseph Mussomeli, while he was the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, he would adopt a melodramatic tone as he told them: “Be careful because Cambodia is the most dangerous place you will ever visit. You will fall in love with it, and eventually it will break your heart.” Cambodia is the only place where the bulk of the nation, more than three-quarters of its people, still lives more or less as they did 1,000 years ago. Until the 1940s, the nation had no schools outside the capital. The populace relied upon village monks who taught the principles of Buddhism and not much else. The state had not a single middle school, high school, or college. In large areas of the nation, the first schools were not built until the 1990s. 60 percent of the nation’s women could not read or write. In a good year - that is, a year with a lot of rain - the family can earn 2 million riel, the Cambodian currency, or about $500. In a drought year, she says, the total may fall to $125 - about 34 cents a day on average - for the entire year. At least 80 percent of the nation’s 13.4 million people live in rural areas, more or less as she does. A smattering of rural homes now have metal roofs - an anthropologist’s measure of social advancement. What’s more, in the past few years, motorbikes have shown up parked outside some of those Middle Ages huts. Thailand, Cambodia’s western neighbor, has a gross domestic product per capita more than four times higher than Cambodia’s. The average annual income for the Thai is about $3,000, compared to just under $600 for Cambodians - the second lowest in Asia. Only Burma is poorer, on a per-capita basis. The average Burmese “were actually more productive and much better off on a material basis than the rural people in Cambodia - even though the Burmese are under a much worse political regime.” Even North Koreans are more prosperous. The average income there is almost triple Cambodia’s. The war in Vietnam ended just four years before the Khmer Rouge defeat in 1979. Yet today Vietnam’s gross domestic product per capita is almost ten times higher than Cambodia’s. Only 19 percent of the economy is based on agriculture, compared to more than one-third for Cambodia. Vietnam manufactures pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and high-tensile steel. Cambodia manufactures T-shirts, rubber, and cement. Most Vietnamese students stay in school until at least the tenth grade. By the tenth grade in Cambodia, all but 13 percent of the students have dropped out. Vietnam’s national literacy rate is above 90 percent. UN agencies say that Cambodia’s hovers around 70 percent. 90 percent of Cambodia’s roads remain unpaved. Cambodian farmers grow a single rice crop per year - the only nation in Asia that does not grow more - and almost none of their farmland is irrigated. Vietnamese embrace change. Cambodians tend to resist it. Even now, Cambodia’s Ministry of Agriculture cannot convince most farmers to adopt modern rice-cultivation strategies that would increase Cambodia’s yield - also the lowest of any major rice-growing nation. One-third to one-half of all Cambodians who lived through the Khmer Rouge era have PTSD. Symptoms of PTSD and related traumatic illnesses are being passed from one generation to the next. This learned behavior is one reason most Cambodians do not react to their leaders’ misbehavior. They are silent when officials enrich themselves on public proceeds and live in mansions. They are quiet when the government sells their property to wealthy businessmen and then soldiers forcibly evict them in the night. Today it’s not unusual for the most desperately poor couples to have as many as eight or ten children. Most Cambodians lack ambition or any hope for a better life. Their religion, Theravadist Buddhism, taught them to shun status and eschew material possessions because “contentment is wealth.” Monks preached that children should be pleased with the lives they had and not aspire for more. King Norodom promised to abolish slavery and end the monarchy’s insistence that all land belonged to the crown. He also pledged to reform “tax collection,” which had grown into a system of runaway thievery. But then Norodom employed a passive-aggressive tactic that would remain commonplace, even into the modern era. He signed orders for all of these reforms - but then declined to enforce them. The Khmer Rouge, like most Cambodians, hated the Vietnamese. And from the beginning of their reign the two states had skirmished along the border. Finally, by the end of 1978, Vietnam had had enough. Thousands of troops poured over the border, and in short order they deposed the Khmer Rouge. Millions of Cambodians quietly cheered as their historical enemy swept through the nation. Three years, eight months, and twenty days after they seized power, the Khmer Rouge slipped furtively into the night. For decades to come, Cambodians, with little prompting, would affirm that the Vietnamese saved their lives. Yet in response to the Vietnamese invasion, the White House merely slapped more sanctions on Vietnam. Nothing was done for the 5 million Khmer Rouge victims, Surprisingly, the United Nations chose to reseat the Khmer Rouge instead of “those puppets,” as Washington referred to the government in Phnom Penh. To the State Department, giving a seat to Vietnam’s government was effectively giving Moscow another vote in the General Assembly. And although the Khmer Rouge were butchers, they were out of power now, living in the jungle - and allied with China, Washington’s new friend. When Ronald Reagan came into office in 1981, he resolutely refused to recognize Cambodia’s quisling government. UN aid agencies were forbidden to set foot in Cambodia. No one was to have anything to do with the stooges Hanoi had installed in Phnom Penh. Vietnamese administrators sat in every government ministry and provincial office, and they worked to remake Cambodia as a Marxist-Leninist state. Cambodia was stuck in a mire, occupied by its mortal enemy, represented before the United Nations and the world by its former genocidal government, governed by Communist dictators despised in the West, locked out of any significant assistance or aid. Cambodia had 7.7 million people in April 1975. Left when the Khmer Rouge fell from power were fewer than 5 million. Vietnam was forced to reassess its own foreign adventures. The government was overstretched. Loath as they were to do it, in 1988 and 1989 the Vietnamese army withdrew from Cambodia - leaving Hun Sen’s puppet Communist government in charge. Finally, on July 18, 1990, Secretary of State Baker announced a change in American policy - a complete reversal. The United States would end its political and tacit military support of the Khmer Rouge more than eleven years after they had fallen from power, a decade after it had become perfectly clear that Pol Pot and his minions had murdered “at least 1.7 million” people, 25 percent of Cambodia’s population. The United Nations would actually take control of Cambodia; the state would become a UN protectorate. The four competing armies would be disarmed, their troops held in special camps until national elections were held and a new democratic government chosen. Michael Hayes, a young American from Massachusetts, had come to Phnom Penh looking for work. He’d been on the staff of the Asia Foundation in Bangkok. But this was the new boomtown. It was 1991, and he was just twenty-four years old. “I was staying at the Royale Hotel,” where everyone from the West stayed - journalists, UN officers, drug dealers, NGOs. “I went to the dining room for breakfast and asked for a newspaper. The waitress told me there are no newspapers here. So I began thinking: Maybe I should be a journalist. I had a lot of friends who were journalists. Maybe I should start a newspaper.” So he did. With help from the UN and his friends, he founded the Phnom Penh Post in 1992, the nation’s first English-language paper, still publishing today. The UN force offered a great deal more than the prospect of military reconciliation. Most Cambodians loved having them in town. The visitors spent money, more money, and then more money still - $3 billion in all. Every staffer was given a daily living allowance of $145 on top of his salary - a year’s income for most Cambodians. Contractors had quickly put up apartment buildings and now were taking in $2,000, $3,000 a month - ridiculously high rents for Phnom Penh. Hotels were full, and new ones were under construction. Anyone who’d ever had a fleeting thought of running a restaurant scrambled to open one. Everyone with a car hired himself out as a driver. Brothels worked overtime; UN doctors treated thousands of their men and women for sexually transmitted diseases. Liquor vendors couldn’t keep up with demand; restaurant and bar owners had to replace fixtures and furniture broken in drunken brawls almost every evening. UN vehicles and equipment routinely disappeared in the night, but no one was sure whether the thieves were Cambodian or renegade UN employees. Under the UN, freedoms of all kinds flowered. A group of political prisoners let out of jail opened a legal-aid organization. Under UN auspices new human-rights advocacy groups began work; education, agriculture, health assistance, and a host of other civil-society organizations opened shop. Groups like these had never been permitted by the Vietnamese, the Khmer Rouge, or the monarchy. But would the new government, whoever won the upcoming election, allow all of this to continue? So, just as his Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese tutors had taught him, Hun Sen went after Ranariddh with everything he had. In 1993 the United Nations reported more than one hundred political assassinations. Nearly all of the dead were Funcinpec officials. A few worked for another smaller Buddhist party. Hun Sen’s political party, the Cambodian People’s Party, or CPP, controlled every province, every town and village - every political jurisdiction in the country. How could it not? Under Vietnam Cambodia had been a one-party state, and Hun Sen had led it. He directed his loyalists in all of these regional offices to bribe, or threaten, everyone to vote for him. The regional officers jumped into the fight with abandon. They burned down Funcinpec headquarters, disrupted rallies, and killed prominent party officials. After all, a few years earlier, when Vietnam ruled the nation, that had been the way things were done. Hun Sen explained, “We have been accused of seizing equipment belonging to two political parties. So I would like to clarify that the equipment has been seized because the parties have acted illegally. They have imported 63 cars without paying taxes, and they illegally set up radio stations in Phnom Penh without applying for proper authorization. And now they are bringing in television equipment without, as before, any permission at all.” Hun Sen was just beginning to make an art of these facile explanations for his government’s belligerent actions. Cambodia then was still a pure dictatorship, with a bit of superficial UN oversight. If Hun Sen wanted to blame faceless bureaucrats following his own unwritten regulations, often invented on the spot, who was to stop him? Washington had turned away from Cambodia almost as soon as Baker stepped down from the podium. The month after Baker made his Cambodian announcement, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and the Bush administration applied all of its attention and energy to the Gulf War. Soon after that came the 1992 presidential campaign. “People lost interest in Cambodia; they were just going through the motions,” Bolton said. Across Cambodia the polls opened the morning of May 23, 1993, and stayed open for six days. Khmer Rouge gunners shelled polling and police stations in Kampong Thom, Kampong Chhnang, Siem Reap, and elsewhere. Election workers fled; several were killed. But the major national offensive the Khmer Rouge had promised never came to pass, and over the six days more than 4 million Cambodians voted, even including some Khmer Rouge soldiers - 90 percent of the eligible voters. Their decision was clear. Hun Sen lost. Only one party came out of the election a clear winner: the United Nations. For all the UN’s shortcomings, mistakes, and failures, it had pulled off a successful election, despite threats, boycotts, and violence. It had repatriated 370,000 refugees who had been living on the Thai border. Hun Sen, Ranariddh, and Sihanouk had sat in that ornate conference room in Paris two years earlier, each conniving to achieve an outcome that would place himself on top. Now, it seemed, each of them had come quite close. Sihanouk was king, but without all the powers he had held before 1970. Both Hun Sen and Ranariddh were heads of the government, but they had to share power. Nevertheless, through all of its history, only one absolute leader had ruled Cambodia. All three men had accepted the new arrangement - but only temporarily. Each of them wanted to be the nation’s absolute ruler and remained determined to make that happen. As Hun Sen had said a few years earlier, “You can talk about sharing power in Paris, but not in Cambodia.” In 1992, the United Nations had arrived with billions of dollars to spend. The nation was awash in cash, though little of it went into the government treasury. Every project the UN undertook offered opportunities for graft - or theft. All that UN money bloated the Cambodian economy. A lot of people got rich. But then, at the end of 1993, the UN and all of its money and expertise were gone. That left “a huge vacuum,” After the UN left, they worried: Who would step up? Who would be the new patron, the next funder? In February 1995, the state seemed to be falling headlong back into its old corrupt ways. Police had begun setting up unofficial checkpoints on the highways where they pulled over drivers and shook them down. Schoolteachers were demanding bribes from students every day as a condition for staying in class. And then, of course, there was the disappearing foreign aid. “Over the last 10 years, people, especially leaders, tended to confuse their personal assets with the state’s assets,” he told the Toronto Star in June 1994. “They saw their personal interests as the national interest. This was the worst combination we could have, a jungle economy and former Communist cadres who use their discretionary powers to serve their personal interests. They’ve been doing whatever they want. They just use their political power to get rich by disposing of national assets like they are their own assets.” A bit later he told the Associated Press, “You cannot start a business here without all the officials asking you for money.” And now, with a divided government, “instead of bribing one party, you have to bribe two.” Even with Hun Sen’s lofty pronouncements about corruption and a free and open press, it quickly became clear that Cambodia remained a dangerous place for the reform-minded. Two months after Rainsy left office, two men riding by on a motorbike shot and killed Chan Dara, a young reporter for the Koh Santepheap (Island of Peace) newspaper, in Kampong Cham, about seventy-five miles northeast of Phnom Penh. Chan Dara had been writing stories about corruption in government - as Hun Sen had publicly requested. A few weeks earlier in downtown Phnom Penh assassins on a motorbike had gunned down Nguon Chan, the editor of the Voice of Cambodian Youth newspaper. He, too, had been reporting on corruption. During a meeting in Paris in 1996 Cambodians held a demonstration against him. Hun Sen warned them: “You can hold a demonstration in France, but do not do it in Cambodia!” Almost 20 percent of all newborns died before they reached age five. One mother in ten did not survive childbirth - among the worst rates in the world. Second-generation effects: He studied two hundred children in a Phnom Penh high school and found that the more they knew about their parents’ traumatic experiences, the worse off they were. “Children, seeking approval, parrot their parents’ aberrant behavior,” Fields said. “There’s also a tendency for children to become ‘parents’ for their parents, to try to help quell their parents’ anxieties. These children tend to see danger when there is no danger,” just like their parents. When asked to list the events they knew their parents were exposed to - starvation, torture, near death - “some of them get angry when they talk about it, showing the role reversal. They have higher anxiety, depression. These stresses take a toll on their lives.” If you have a traumatic childhood, you are more likely to get PTSD. So we have children who are growing up with violent parents who are drunk and beat them. That’s the generation that’s coming.” That new generation has already arrived. In about 2004 Cambodian officials estimated that one-quarter of the nation’s men frequently beat their wives and children - one of the highest rates in the world. By the end of the decade, as more of the Khmer Rouge victims’ children married and had children of their own, the rate had actually increased, to about one-third of the nation’s families. More than 80 percent of the people lived in the countryside. In 1998 most of them did not have television or radio. Newspapers did not circulate outside the cities, and most of the rural residents could not read. What news of the campaign they were able to hear usually came from their village chiefs, every one of them a CPP stalwart. The government was riven with marital and professional nepotism. In a nation where no one trusted anyone else and everyone looked out only for himself, the family stood as the only social grouping in which people confidently relied on one another. Serge Thion, a French sociologist, said it best: “Explaining Cambodia is typically a foreigner’s business,” he wrote. “For about one century, foreigners have been providing explanations.” In 2002 the Cambodian government sold the rights to explore for oil off its coast to Chevron Oil Company. In 2005 Chevron put out a statement, saying, “We are very encouraged to find oil in each of the first four wells of this drilling program.” Two years later the International Monetary Fund ventured an estimate. Within a decade, it said, Cambodia could begin taking in $1.7 billion in oil revenues each year. Cambodia chartered a new national oil company, and Hun Sen gave the oil portfolio to Sok An, the deputy prime minister. The new company operated in total secrecy; one human-rights group charged that state oil-company employees were forbidden even to use the telephone. Hun Sen talked about using the profits to reduce poverty and promote development. No one believed him. The IMF urged Cambodia to pass The World Bank pressured Cambodia to sign the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, an international agreement that would require public disclosure of oil and gas revenues. But in 2008 Hun Sen refused and called external criticism of his oil policies “crazy.” Then, in the fall of 2010, opposition politicians grew so frustrated about all of this that they wrote a plaintiff letter to twentytwo U.S. senators, saying, “Cambodia is ripe for disastrous extraction of our oil reserves” because the government was granting “99 year concessions for enormous swaths of land” over presumed oil reserves “in exchange for private pay-offs to a small number of associates at the top of the ruling party.” That’s why we have to try to develop systems” that bring transparency to government spending. “And, yes, there is a sense of urgency here.” Then in 2010 the reason for the urgency became clear. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation into whether one oil company paid a $2.5 million bribe to government officials in 2007 for the right to look for oil. When Hun Sen learned of the SEC investigation three years later, he said the money had gone into a “social fund” for schools and hospitals. “It’s not under-the-table money.” But he refused to say exactly how the money had been spent. Traveling the country, talking to governors, looking at schools and hospitals, no one told me of any significant new projects. And, of course, the new anticorruption agency chose not to take up this case. China became Cambodia’s single largest donor. When donors pledged almost $1 billion in December 2008, $257 million of that came from China. Beijing actually spent billions more to build dams and roads and other infrastructure. And, of course, China’s aid came with no strings - except that Hun Sen had to endorse Beijing’s “one-China” policy on Taiwan. So where is Cambodia heading? “I have become so dispirited,” lamented Yeng Virak, executive director of the Community Legal Education Center. He sighed heavily and shook his head. “The foreigners, the donors, they say Cambodia is so much better off than in the past. But I feel sad and worried. We are falling off a cliff!” Cambodians have been abused by so many leaders over so many years that they expect nothing from their government. In fact, they remain convinced that any change at all will be painful, if not fatal. As Vickery put it, they want only to be left alone. The Sudanese government slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people, but in both places rebel groups fought back - eventually bringing the conflicts to a military standstill. Cambodians are incapable of that. Burmese are far more productive. They grow almost twice as much rice per acre and generally are more prosperous. Occasionally, they stage massive pro-democracy demonstrations, even knowing that the government will strike back. Cambodians are incapable of that. Haiti remained the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest in the world. As in Cambodia, most residents did not have electricity, toilets, or clean water. But by almost every measure Haitians were better off. In 2007 10 percent of Haiti’s people had access to the Internet. In Cambodia the number was close to zero. When Joseph Mussomeli was the U.S. ambassador, he said he would “always tell the Cambodians that we put about six hundred American government officials in jail each year for corruption. It reminds me that we also have a corrupt society and that we are doing the right thing about it. We’re putting them in jail. There’s no shame in admitting corruption; the shame is in denying it and not doing something about it.” Many nations have suffered dark histories that left sad legacies. Many of those same nations are ruled by leaders who mistreat the people now. But no nation has suffered so much in the recent past. No other people lived through an era when their own leaders killed one-quarter of the population - only to find that when the offending government fell, uncaring, avaricious leaders replaced it. No other nation’s population is so riven with PTSD and other traumatic mental illnesses that are being passed to a second generation and potentially to a third - darkening the nation’s personality. All of that offers the Cambodian people a toxic mix of abuse unmatched anywhere in the world. But given their history, given the subservient state Cambodians have accepted without complaint for more than a millennium, they don’t seem to care. Once, just once, they dared to hope. The world’s major nations gave them the chance to choose their leader for the first time in history. Almost every Cambodian embraced it; 90 percent of them voted. But then their leaders betrayed them, and the world deserted them. Now, once again, most expect nothing more than they have. They carry no ambitions. They hold no dreams. All they want is to be left alone. The nation grows ever more prosperous, too. For all his faults, Hun Sen has given Cambodians one very important thing: more than a decade of stability and calm that bring some predictability to their lives for the first time in centuries. Stability is important not just for Cambodians. It encourages more tourists to visit the Khmer Rouge sites in Phnom Penh and the monuments left behind from the Khmer empire at Angkor. Tourism, one of the three legs of Cambodia’s economy, continues to grow. Leopard Capital, an investment-fund manager in Southeast Asia, said tourist arrivals increased by 26 percent between 2008 and 2009. In the first half of 2010, 1.2 million people visited Cambodia, another large increase. Foreign investment is still slow to come and is unlikely to grow significantly, as long as businessmen see that so many hands will be reaching into their pockets as soon as they arrive. For now, few Western companies dare to try. It’s hard to overstate how important trees are to Cambodians. Since the beginning of human habitation of this bucolic state, people have built their homes from tree trunks, limbs, and branches - even making use of the leaves. They’ve taken food from the fruit trees, burned tree limbs to cook their food, lived in the shade of trees as protection from the brutal heat, tapped tree resin to seal the hulls of their fishing boats, and much more. That is why so many people looked on with genuine distress as the Khmer Rouge, after their defeat, denuded northwestern Cambodia of vast forests and sold the lumber to Thai generals. These weren’t just any old trees. Cambodia is fortunate to be home to tropical trees that produce some of the world’s most beautiful woods. Some provide exquisite-looking lumber that in appearance offers a rich, unique coloration. It’s roughly a cross between walnut and mahogany with an attractive meandering grain. Some feature a blondwood stripe, maybe three-quarters of an inch wide, that twists and turns through the tree. Cambodians call the lumber from these trees “luxury wood.” It is prized and quite valuable. Through the 1990s all manner of Cambodians plunged into this orgy of deforestation. Patrons to roadside beer bars in Pailin, near the western border, sat in luxury-wood chairs pulled up to table tops made from one solid slab of this wood, four feet wide, six feet long - and seven inches deep. A fifteen-dollar-a-night guesthouse in Battambang featured massive luxury-wood beds with heavily carved headboards, eight feet tall. One of those blond stripes coursed through the footboard, and each of these beds weighed well over 1,000 pounds. Cambodia’s trees were fast disappearing. But early in the 2000s the World Bank office in Phnom Penh made saving the remaining forests a major priority. In 2001 two mothers visited the Licadho offices in Phnom Penh asking for help. They were divorced and impoverished, and both said a kind man had come to them, promising to help. He offered to take their babies - one was six months old, the other just four days - to a children’s center that would care for them until the women got back on their feet. The mothers could visit their babies as often as they wanted. He gave each of them a bit of cash and took the babies away. But once they had given up their babies, the mothers were not permitted to see them. Licadho investigated and found that the children had been taken to “an orphanage run by an adoption facilitator who caters to the U.S. market,” the group reported. And this was no isolated incident. Across Cambodia hundreds of women were being tricked or coerced into giving up their babies. The children effectively were being sold to Americans. They were eager to adopt Cambodian children and did not know the babies had been stolen. Fees for such a service generally ran up to about $10,000. But the scam didn’t simply end with unscrupulous baby brokers. For these babies to leave the country, each had to have a passport issued by the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs. Officers in both ministries were demanding rich bribes from the brokers, and as usual they were passing part of the proceeds up to their superiors. “Sometimes a woman would have a difficult birth, and someone would agree to treat her in the hospital - and take care of the baby. When she woke up, they’d say, ‘Baby? What baby?’ The babies were taken to warehouses of sorts. They might have fifty babies at a time. I visited a number of them.”","Cambodia's political history from 1978 to 2009 or so. Appalling, horrible, infuriating, disgusting, etc. I hated this book. I was hoping to learn more about Cambodia and its culture, but this only gives chapter after chapter detailing the horrible things the people in government did, and nothing else. No bright side. No other insights. Just horror."
Conspiracy of the Rich,ert Kiyosaki,0446559806,0,"Conspiracy of the Rich - Robert Kiyosaki The name of the game is cash flow - to be in the 10 percent who collect the cash flow from the other 90 percent. Mutual fund companies take investors’ money and legally siphon out cash flow via hidden fees and expenses. Mutual funds are horrible investment vehicles designed for financially average people. People who play the game of capital gains are often hoping the price of their home will go up or that the stock market will go up. However, someone who invests for cash flow does not really care if the market or the price of a house goes up or down. The problem with net worth is that, in markets like the one we are currently in, it is worthless. Net worth is often measured by capital gains. For example, if you buy a house for $1 million, technically that is part of your net worth, but if you cannot sell it for $1 million and instead have to sell it for $500,000 and your loan is for $700,000, your net worth is worthless. Rather than use net worth, I use cash flow to measure my wealth. The money my investments bring in every month is true wealth - not some perceived notion of value that may or may not be true. Good cash flow strategies provide passive income that is taxed as little as possible and that you can control. Average cash flow strategies provide passive income that is taxed at the highest income bracket and that you have little to no control over. The following are some examples of average cash flow strategies: Savings, Stocks, Annuities Financial planners and stockbrokers to say things like the stock market goes up 8 percent per year. They use the lure of capital gains to draw your cash flow into their pockets. Real estate agents use a similar sales pitch. They often say, “You’d better buy now before prices go up.” The idea of buying before prices go up is buying on the expectation of capital gains. Again the salesperson uses the lure of capital gains to get your cash flow. That’s the game. The moment you sign that mortgage, cash flows from you to them. I am not against the concept of mutual funds. I am, however, against the high fees and hidden expenses of mutual funds that rob investors of their money. On top of that, there are thousands of mutual funds, but less than 30 percent of them actually beat the S&P 500. In other words, all you have to do is invest in an S&P Index Fund and you will beat over 70 percent of all mutual fund managers - all with less money and higher returns. Rather than use the words long term, a sophisticated investor would use the words exit strategy. A smart investor knows it’s not about how long you hold on to an investment. It’s about how you plan to increase your wealth with that investment over a stated period of time. Warren Buffett: “Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they are doing.” There are four basic investment categories. They are: 1. Businesses: The rich often own many businesses providing passive income, while an average person may have many jobs providing earned income. 2. Income-producing investment real estate: These are properties that provide passive income every month in the form of rent. Your home or your vacation home doesn’t count, even if your financial planner tells you they’re assets. 3. Paper assets - stocks, bonds, savings, annuities, insurance, and mutual funds: Most average investors have paper assets because they are easy to buy, require little management, and are liquid - meaning they are easy to get out of. 4. Commodities - gold, silver, oil, platinum, etc.: Most average investors do not know how or where to buy commodities. In many cases, they don’t even know how or where to buy physical gold or silver. A sophisticated investor invests in all four categories. That is true diversification. Dr. Fuller said, “Words are the most powerful tools invented by humans.” By making the simple complex, the financial world sounds intelligent and makes you feel stupid when it comes to money. When you feel stupid, it is easier to take your money. A broad definition of a derivative is a substance that can be made from another substance. For example, orange juice is a derivative of an orange. One definition of a financial derivative is having a value from an underlying variable asset. By way of example, a share of common stock is a derivative of an existing company, such as Apple Computers. Simply said, when you buy a share of Apple, you are buying a derivative of Apple, the company. And when you buy a share of a mutual fund, you are buying a derivative of that fund, which is a derivative of stocks - a derivative of a derivative. Derivatives are also tools for mass financial creation. Prior to 1971, the dollar was a derivative of gold. After 1971, the dollar became a derivative of debt, an IOU known as U.S. bonds and T-bills, backed by the promise of the U.S. taxpayer to pay the bills. Print Your Own Money: Creating a derivative is as easy as squeezing juice from an orange. By simplifying and understanding the definition of a financial derivative, you can easily tap into the power of that word. We can all create simple derivatives. We can all create money out of thin air - derivatives of our thoughts. We all have the power to print our own money if we train our minds to think in terms of derivatives. In other words, money can be a derivative of financial knowledge. I do not save money is because I am a borrower, not a saver. I love debt - as long as someone else will pay for that debt. I do what the banks do. For example, I borrow $1 million at 10 percent and buy an apartment complex. I get my tenants to pay me at least 20 percent for the $1 million I borrowed at 10 percent interest. I sell the license to print this book to over fifty publishers throughout the world. The publishers then take the license they bought from me, and they print books, another derivative, and ship them to bookstores in their country. Once a quarter, I receive royalty payments from these fifty publishers. The royalty payments are derivatives of the books, the books are derivatives of the license, the license is a derivative of this book, and this book is a derivative of me. You need to know and use such words as derivative, cash flow, cap rate, and mitigate. Rich dad’s advice was never to think, look, or act like a poor person. He constantly reminded me that “the world treats you as you treat yourself.” If I don’t have money for something I want, I use my head to figure out how to get it. I do not let the amount of money in my bank account dictate the boundaries of my life. One advisor I follow religiously is Richard Russell, an expert on the stock market. I consider the stock market to be a Ponzi scheme. If no new money comes in, the market crashes. The same is true with real estate or the bond markets. One big reason why so many people struggle financially is because they have little to sell, don’t know how to sell, or both. So if you are struggling financially, find something to sell, learn to sell better, or both. Building a business and taking it public, which means selling shares on a stock exchange, is the ultimate goal of an entrepreneur. Why we’re in this financial crisis: China is selling and the United States is buying. School trained us to take tests alone. If I were to collaborate or ask for help from my classmates on a test, that was called cheating. I believe that this line of thinking causes millions of people to operate as islands, afraid of cooperating with others because they are trained that cooperation is somehow akin to cheating. Because the United States is printing money, all other countries will probably have to print money. If other countries do not print, then their countries’ currency will become too strong against the dollar and exports to the United States will slow down, causing a slowdown in the exporting country’s economy. This probably means inflation in every country that trades with the United States. As I write this in June 2009, I believe we are merely in the eye of the storm, and the worst is yet to come. Back in August 2007, it took just a $20 billion a month mortgage reset to blow down the financial straw houses of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. The economy of Iceland collapsed with the first huff from the big bad wolf. Bank of America, Royal Bank of Scotland, and AIG, financial houses of sticks, are weak and wobbly today. California, the eighth largest economy in the world, is on the brink of a financial meltdown, as is the Japanese economy. My question is: What will a nearly $40 billion a month mortgage reset from October to November 2011 bring? The way you print your own money is by achieving an infinite return on your money. The definition I use for an infinite return is “money for nothing.” I print my own money when I get back all the money I used to acquire an asset, still own the asset, and enjoy the benefits of the cash flow from the asset. The key to the success of the Rich Dad Company is that the business designs and creates assets rather than products. For example, we will not produce this book. Rather, we will create a derivative of the book, a literary license, and sell the rights to the license to publishers for different languages. We also sell licenses for the rights to produce our games, brand trademarks, and franchise rights. There are many ways you can print your own money with paper assets such as stocks. One way is to use option strategies. For example, let’s say I buy a thousand shares of a stock for $2 a share. I then go to the options market and sell an option to buy my thousand shares for a $1 premium per share ($1,000) for thirty days. If the stock hits $3 per share or higher, the person who purchased the option can buy the stock at $3. If the stock does not hit $3 in thirty days, I keep his option money of $1,000. Again, notice that I buy for the long term and sell time by the month. In this overly simplified example, selling a thirty-day option puts $1,000 immediately in my pocket. If I sell another thirty-day option with the same stock on the same terms and the stock does not go above $3, I make another $1,000 off my original $2,000 investment while still owning my stock. I will have made 100 percent of my initial $2,000 back, and have printed my own money via my financial knowledge. To me, this makes more sense than leaving your money in mutual funds for the long term and having your money stolen legally by short-term stock and option traders. I would rather hold gold and silver than cash. Since I am able to print my own money, I do not need to worry about saving money for a rainy day. With governments printing so much money, I feel safer saving gold and silver. People who invest for capital gains are gambling. As Warren Buffett has said, “The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is because it is going up.” Investing for capital gains is also why most investors get depressed when the stock market drops or their home declines in value. Investing for capital gains is much like gambling because the investor has very little control over the ups and downs of a market. A person with a financial education invests for both cash flow and capital gains. If your money is just parked waiting for appreciation or an increase in the share price, your currency is not productive and not working for you. Investing for cash flow takes most of the risk out of investing. It’s hard to feel like a loser as long as cash is flowing into your pockets - even if your asset price has depreciated. On the other hand, if your asset appreciates, it’s an added bonus since you are already collecting cash flow. A technical investor looks for historical patterns in markets based on cash flow and makes investments based on past patterns and future predictions of market behavior. A financially educated investor also wants to know where cash is flowing from and which market it is flowing into. For example, when the stock market was crashing and people were afraid, a lot of money was flowing into the gold market. A technical investor may have been able to predict that gold was going to rise and that the stock market was going to fall based on technical indicators and would then have moved his money to gold before everyone else. One reason why financially educated people want to keep their money moving is because if they park their money in one asset class, as many amateur investors do, they may lose their money when cash flows out of that asset class. The product is the smallest or least important part of the B-I Triangle. The reason so many people fail when starting a business is because they focus on the product, not the entire B-I Triangle. The same is true in real estate. Many investors look only at the property rather than the entire B-I Triangle. Quickly analyze most investments by simply asking myself: Who are the partners, and do I want to be a partner with them? What is the financing structure and is it favorable? How competent is the management? If those questions are satisfied, I may look further into the investment. BUSINESSES Advantages: A business is one of the most powerful assets to own because you can benefit from tax advantages, leverage people to increase your cash flow, and have control of your operations. The richest people in the world build businesses. Examples are Steve Jobs, founder of Apple; Thomas Edison, founder of General Electric; and Sergey Brin, founder of Google. Disadvantages: Businesses are “people intense.” By that I mean that you have to manage employees, clients, and customers. People skills and leadership skills, as well as talented people who can work as a team, are essential for a business to be a success. In my opinion, of all four asset classes, a business takes the most financial intelligence and experience to be successful. REAL ESTATE Advantages: Real estate can have high returns due to using a bank’s money for leverage via financing and other people’s money (OPM) via investors, capitalizing from tax advantages like depreciation, and collecting steady cash flow if the asset is managed well. Disadvantages: Real estate is a management-intensive asset, is illiquid, and if mismanaged can cost you a lot of money. After a business, real estate requires the second highest level of financial intelligence. COMMODITIES: GOLD, SILVER, OIL, ETC. Advantages: Commodities are a good hedge or protection against inflation - which is important when governments are printing a lot of money, as they are today. The reason they buffer against inflation is because they are tangible assets that are purchased with currency. So when the currency supply increases there are more dollars chasing the same amount of goods. This causes the price of the commodities to rise, or inflate. Good examples of this are oil, gold, and silver, all of which are worth much more than they were a few years ago thanks to the Fed’s printing presses. Disadvantages: Because commodities are physical assets, you have to make sure they are stored properly. Once you decide which asset class is best for you, and which asset class you are most interested in, then I suggest studying that asset class and investing your time before investing your money. The reason I say this is because it is not the asset itself that makes you rich. You can lose money in any of the asset classes. Rather, it is your knowledge of each asset class that makes you rich. The problem with a diversified portfolio of mutual funds is that you are not really diversified, since all mutual funds are in the stock market - paper assets. True diversification includes investing in all four asset classes, not just different types of one asset class. My asset column contains all four assets: businesses, real estate, paper assets, and commodities. It is important to focus. Choose the asset class you want to be good in and follow one course until you are successful. For example, if you are interested in real estate, study, practice, start small, and focus until you have cash flowing into your bank account consistently. Once you are certain you can produce cash flow in your small deals then cautiously go after bigger deals, staying focused on making sure the investment cash flows. I sell Rich Dad Franchises to people who want to own their own businesses. A Rich Dad Franchise costs a person approximately $35,000, and in about two years, if they follow our business training programs, they have the potential to earn $100,000 to $200,000 a year. Professional investors invest with insurance. Most of us would not drive a car or own a home without insurance. Yet most people invest without insurance. That is very risky. For example, when I invest in the stock market, I can buy insurance, such as a put option. Let’s say I purchase a stock for $10. I can also buy a put option for $1 to pay me $9 if the stock price falls. If the stock drops to $5, the put option acts as insurance and pays me $9 for a stock worth $5. For my real estate investments, I have insurance against losses to fire, floods, and other natural disasters. Another bonus of owning real estate is that the rent my tenants pay me covers the cost of the insurance. If my property burns down, I do not lose money, because I have insurance to cover my losses. Good debt is tax-free money. Since it is borrowed money, you don’t pay taxes for it or to use it. For example, if I put $20,000 as a down payment on a rental property and borrow $80,000, in most cases the $20,000 is my money after taxes and $80,000 is tax-free money. The key to using debt is to know how to borrow wisely and how to pay the money back. Knowing how to borrow money wisely, and getting someone else, such as your tenants or your business, to pay the money back is your credit-ability, or credibility. The higher your credibility, the more debt you can use to become rich - tax-free. We buy (real estate) in areas where there are jobs. The real value of real estate is related to jobs. We own apartment houses in Texas and Oklahoma, where there are jobs in the oil industry. We do not own anything in Detroit, where jobs are leaving and real estate values are dropping. We own property where there are natural or government constraints. For example, we own apartments where there is a no-growth boundary around the city. In other words, the city cannot spread out any farther, which makes properties more valuable because it limits supply. We also own properties that are bordered by a river, a constraint of nature, prohibiting further growth. When I have excess amounts of cash flow, rather than hold the excess cash in a savings account, I choose to hold it in gold and silver.","Yet another Rich Dad book shat out for the usual audience of those who don't read. Often so bad it hurts, but with the occasional useful sentence. He always seems to go out of his way to avoid giving any usable info - only generalities. Does he care? Is he trying to write great books? Are these things just machine-generated or something?"
The Think Big Manifesto,Michael Port and Mina Samuels,81933563,0,"Think: “Why not me?” instead of “Why me?” To think big is to begin by letting go of what we don’t need: habits, attitudes, and beliefs that stand in the way of thinking big. Once your core is identified, is it easy to expose it for the world to see. To let people know what we stand for is to lay ourselves bare, all those raw nerve endings reachable, touchable by others. It can make a person uncomfortable just to think about such vulnerability. We have wasted our resources on self-protection, and in the end it will never work. Don’t intellectualize. When you overthink what you stand for, the energy leaks away. Your identity is driven by an inner passion, not a cold inner rationality. I’m not knocking rationality. It has its place, but it is not the core. Who do you know of, or know, who is a big thinker? Why do you admire that person? What does he or she stand for? What do you stand for? As long as you’re willing to keep learning, you can be an expert. Sometimes all it takes is staying a few steps ahead of the rest of the pack. You don’t have to have all the answers, but you do need to keep asking the right questions.","One of the few books I've actively disliked. Ever read the introduction to a book? Where they say “what you hold in your hands here is something that could change the world”, and blah blah blah? I kept reading, wondering when the introduction was going to be over. Over halfway through the book, I realized this was it: just broad general encouraging unuseful nothings for the entire book."
